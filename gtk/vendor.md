<!-- struct AboutDialog -->
The `AboutDialog` offers a simple way to display information about
a program like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is
also possible to give credits to the authors, documenters, translators
and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically
opened when the user selects the `About` option from the `Help` menu.
All parts of the dialog are optional.

About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. `AboutDialog`
displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls `gtk_show_uri`
when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
`AboutDialog::activate-link` signal.

To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
"Edgar Allan Poe <edgar`poe.com`>". To specify a website with a title,
use a string like "GTK+ team http://www.gtk.org".

To make constructing a `AboutDialog` as convenient as possible, you can
use the function `gtk_show_about_dialog` which constructs and shows a dialog
and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.

Note that GTK+ sets a default title of `_("About %s")` on the dialog
window (where \%s is replaced by the name of the application, but in
order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
set the title property explicitly when constructing a `AboutDialog`,
as shown in the following example:

```C
gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                       "program-name", "ExampleCode",
                       "logo", example_logo,
                       "title" _("About ExampleCode"),
                       NULL);
```

It is also possible to show a `AboutDialog` like any other `Dialog`,
e.g. using `Dialog::run`. In this case, you might need to know that
the “Close” button returns the `ResponseType::Cancel` response id.

<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_logo -->
Sets the pixbuf to be displayed as logo in the about dialog.
If it is `None`, the default window icon set with
`Window::set_default_icon` will be used.
## `logo`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`
<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_logo_icon_name -->
Sets the pixbuf to be displayed as logo in the about dialog.
If it is `None`, the default window icon set with
`Window::set_default_icon` will be used.
## `icon_name`
an icon name, or `None`
<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_program_name -->
Sets the name to display in the about dialog.
If this is not set, it defaults to `g_get_application_name`.
## `name`
the program name
<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_translator_credits -->
Sets the translator credits string which is displayed in
the translators tab of the secondary credits dialog.

The intended use for this string is to display the translator
of the language which is currently used in the user interface.
Using `gettext`, a simple way to achieve that is to mark the
string for translation:

```C
 gtk_about_dialog_set_translator_credits (about,
                                          _("translator-credits"));
```
It is a good idea to use the customary msgid “translator-credits” for this
purpose, since translators will already know the purpose of that msgid, and
since `AboutDialog` will detect if “translator-credits” is untranslated
and hide the tab.
## `translator_credits`
the translator credits
<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_version -->
Sets the version string to display in the about dialog.
## `version`
the version string

<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_wrap_license -->
Sets whether the license text in `self` is
automatically wrapped.
## `wrap_license`
whether to wrap the license
<!-- struct AccelGroup -->
A `AccelGroup` represents a group of keyboard accelerators,
typically attached to a toplevel `Window` (with
`Window::add_accel_group`). Usually you won’t need to create a
`AccelGroup` directly; instead, when using `UIManager`, GTK+
automatically sets up the accelerators for your menus in the ui
manager’s `AccelGroup`.

Note that “accelerators” are different from
“mnemonics”. Accelerators are shortcuts for
activating a menu item; they appear alongside the menu item they’re a
shortcut for. For example “Ctrl+Q” might appear alongside the “Quit”
menu item. Mnemonics are shortcuts for GUI elements such as text
entries or buttons; they appear as underlined characters. See
`Label::new_with_mnemonic`. Menu items can have both accelerators
and mnemonics, of course.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn new -->
Creates a new `AccelGroup`.

# Returns

a new `AccelGroup` object
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn from_accel_closure -->
Finds the `AccelGroup` to which `closure` is connected;
see `AccelGroup::connect`.
## `closure`
a `gobject::Closure`

# Returns

the `AccelGroup` to which `closure`
 is connected, or `None`
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn activate -->
Finds the first accelerator in `self` that matches
`accel_key` and `accel_mods`, and activates it.
## `accel_quark`
the quark for the accelerator name
## `acceleratable`
the `gobject::Object`, usually a `Window`, on which
 to activate the accelerator
## `accel_key`
accelerator keyval from a key event
## `accel_mods`
keyboard state mask from a key event

# Returns

`true` if an accelerator was activated and handled
 this keypress
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn connect -->
Installs an accelerator in this group. When `self` is being
activated in response to a call to `gtk_accel_groups_activate`,
`closure` will be invoked if the `accel_key` and `accel_mods` from
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` match those of this connection.

The signature used for the `closure` is that of ``GtkAccelGroupActivate``.

Note that, due to implementation details, a single closure can
only be connected to one accelerator group.
## `accel_key`
key value of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier combination of the accelerator
## `accel_flags`
a flag mask to configure this accelerator
## `closure`
closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn connect_by_path -->
Installs an accelerator in this group, using an accelerator path
to look up the appropriate key and modifiers (see
`AccelMap::add_entry`). When `self` is being activated
in response to a call to `gtk_accel_groups_activate`, `closure` will
be invoked if the `accel_key` and `accel_mods` from
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` match the key and modifiers for the path.

The signature used for the `closure` is that of ``GtkAccelGroupActivate``.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore,
if you pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it
first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
path used for determining key and modifiers
## `closure`
closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn disconnect -->
Removes an accelerator previously installed through
`AccelGroup::connect`.

Since 2.20 `closure` can be `None`.

 group, or `None` to remove all closures

# Returns

`true` if the closure was found and got disconnected
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn disconnect_key -->
Removes an accelerator previously installed through
`AccelGroup::connect`.
## `accel_key`
key value of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier combination of the accelerator

# Returns

`true` if there was an accelerator which could be
 removed, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn find -->
Finds the first entry in an accelerator group for which
`find_func` returns `true` and returns its `AccelKey`.
## `find_func`
a function to filter the entries
 of `self` with
## `data`
data to pass to `find_func`

# Returns

the key of the first entry passing
 `find_func`. The key is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed.
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn get_is_locked -->
Locks are added and removed using `AccelGroup::lock` and
`AccelGroup::unlock`.

# Returns

`true` if there are 1 or more locks on the `self`,
 `false` otherwise.
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn get_modifier_mask -->
Gets a `gdk::ModifierType` representing the mask for this
`self`. For example, `gdk::ModifierType::ControlMask`, `gdk::ModifierType::ShiftMask`, etc.

# Returns

the modifier mask for this accel group.
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn lock -->
Locks the given accelerator group.

Locking an acelerator group prevents the accelerators contained
within it to be changed during runtime. Refer to
`AccelMap::change_entry` about runtime accelerator changes.

If called more than once, `self` remains locked until
`AccelGroup::unlock` has been called an equivalent number
of times.
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn query -->
Queries an accelerator group for all entries matching `accel_key`
and `accel_mods`.
## `accel_key`
key value of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier combination of the accelerator
## `n_entries`
location to return the number
 of entries found, or `None`

# Returns

an array of
 `n_entries` `AccelGroupEntry` elements, or `None`. The array
 is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed.
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn unlock -->
Undoes the last call to `AccelGroup::lock` on this `self`.
<!-- struct ActionBar -->
`ActionBar` is designed to present contextual actions. It is
expected to be displayed below the content and expand horizontally
to fill the area.

It allows placing children at the start or the end. In addition, it
contains an internal centered box which is centered with respect to
the full width of the box, even if the children at either side take
up different amounts of space.

Feature: `v3_12`

<!-- struct Actionable -->
This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with
actions on a `ApplicationWindow` or `Application`.

It primarily consists of two properties: `Actionable:action-name`
and `Actionable:action-target`. There are also some convenience APIs
for setting these properties.

The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the `ApplicationWindow`
or "`Application`, but other action groups that are added with
`Widget::insert_action_group` will be consulted as well.

# Implements

[`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait ActionableExt -->
Trait containing all `Actionable` methods.

<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_name -->
Gets the action name for `self`.

See `Actionable::set_action_name` for more information.

# Returns

the action name, or `None` if none is set
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_target_value -->
Gets the current target value of `actionabe`.

See `Actionable::set_action_target_value` for more information.

# Returns

the current target value
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_name -->
Specifies the name of the action with which this widget should be
associated. If `action_name` is `None` then the widget will be
unassociated from any previous action.

Usually this function is used when the widget is located (or will be
located) within the hierarchy of a `ApplicationWindow`.

Names are of the form “win.save” or “app.quit” for actions on the
containing `ApplicationWindow` or its associated `Application`,
respectively. This is the same form used for actions in the `gio::Menu`
associated with the window.
## `action_name`
an action name, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target -->
Sets the target of an actionable widget.

This is a convenience function that calls `glib::Variant::new` for
`format_string` and uses the result to call
`Actionable::set_action_target_value`.

If you are setting a string-valued target and want to set the action
name at the same time, you can use
gtk_actionable_set_detailed_action_name ().
## `format_string`
a GVariant format string
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target_value -->
Sets the target value of an actionable widget.

If `target_value` is `None` then the target value is unset.

The target value has two purposes. First, it is used as the
parameter to activation of the action associated with the
`Actionable` widget. Second, it is used to determine if the widget
should be rendered as “active” — the widget is active if the state
is equal to the given target.

Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a `gio::Action`
with string state in a typical “radio button” situation. Each button
will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
value for that action. Clicking on a particular button will activate
the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
the action’s state to change to that value. Since the action’s state
is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
rendered inactive).
## `target_value`
a `glib::Variant` to set as the target value, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_detailed_action_name -->
Sets the action-name and associated string target value of an
actionable widget.

This allows for the effect of both `Actionable::set_action_name`
and `Actionable::set_action_target_value` in the common case that
the target is string-valued.

`detailed_action_name` is a string of the form
`"action::target"` where `action`
is the action name and `target` is the string to use
as the target.
## `detailed_action_name`
the detailed action name
<!-- struct Adjustment -->
The `Adjustment` object represents a value which has an associated lower
and upper bound, together with step and page increments, and a page size.
It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including
`SpinButton`, `Viewport`, and `Range` (which is a base class for
`HScrollbar`, `VScrollbar`, `HScale`, and `VScale`).

The `Adjustment` object does not update the value itself. Instead
it is left up to the owner of the `Adjustment` to control the value.

The owner of the `Adjustment` typically calls the
`Adjustment::value_changed` and `Adjustment::changed` functions
after changing the value and its bounds. This results in the emission of the
`Adjustment::value_changed` or `Adjustment::changed` signal respectively.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn new -->
Creates a new `Adjustment`.
## `value`
the initial value.
## `lower`
the minimum value.
## `upper`
the maximum value.
## `step_increment`
the step increment.
## `page_increment`
the page increment.
## `page_size`
the page size.

# Returns

a new `Adjustment`.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn changed -->
Emits a `Adjustment::changed` signal from the `Adjustment`.
This is typically called by the owner of the `Adjustment` after it has
changed any of the `Adjustment` properties other than the value.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn clamp_page -->
Updates the `Adjustment:value` property to ensure that the range
between `lower` and `upper` is in the current page (i.e. between
`Adjustment:value` and `Adjustment:value` + `Adjustment:page_size`).
If the range is larger than the page size, then only the start of it will
be in the current page.
A `Adjustment::changed` signal will be emitted if the value is changed.
## `lower`
the lower value.
## `upper`
the upper value.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn configure -->
Sets all properties of the adjustment at once.

Use this function to avoid multiple emissions of the `Adjustment::changed`
signal. See `Adjustment::set_lower` for an alternative way
of compressing multiple emissions of `Adjustment::changed` into one.
## `value`
the new value
## `lower`
the new minimum value
## `upper`
the new maximum value
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
## `page_size`
the new page size
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_lower -->
Retrieves the minimum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current minimum value of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_minimum_increment -->
Gets the smaller of step increment and page increment.

# Returns

the minimum increment of `self`
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_page_increment -->
Retrieves the page increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page increment of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_page_size -->
Retrieves the page size of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page size of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_step_increment -->
Retrieves the step increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current step increment of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_upper -->
Retrieves the maximum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current maximum value of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the adjustment. See
gtk_adjustment_set_value ().

# Returns

The current value of the adjustment.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_lower -->
Sets the minimum value of the adjustment.

When setting multiple adjustment properties via their individual
setters, multiple `Adjustment::changed` signals will be emitted. However, since
the emission of the `Adjustment::changed` signal is tied to the emission of the
`gobject::Object::notify` signals of the changed properties, it’s possible
to compress the `Adjustment::changed` signals into one by calling
`gobject::Object::freeze_notify` and `gobject::Object::thaw_notify` around the
calls to the individual setters.

Alternatively, using a single `gobject::Object::set` for all the properties
to change, or using `Adjustment::configure` has the same effect
of compressing `Adjustment::changed` emissions.
## `lower`
the new minimum value
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_page_increment -->
Sets the page increment of the adjustment.

See `Adjustment::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting multiple adjustment
properties.
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_page_size -->
Sets the page size of the adjustment.

See `Adjustment::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment`::changed signal when setting multiple adjustment
properties.
## `page_size`
the new page size
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_step_increment -->
Sets the step increment of the adjustment.

See `Adjustment::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting multiple adjustment
properties.
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_upper -->
Sets the maximum value of the adjustment.

Note that values will be restricted by
`upper - page-size` if the page-size
property is nonzero.

See `Adjustment::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting multiple adjustment
properties.
## `upper`
the new maximum value
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn set_value -->
Sets the `Adjustment` value. The value is clamped to lie between
`Adjustment:lower` and `Adjustment:upper`.

Note that for adjustments which are used in a `Scrollbar`, the effective
range of allowed values goes from `Adjustment:lower` to
`Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page_size`.
## `value`
the new value.
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn value_changed -->
Emits a `Adjustment::value_changed` signal from the `Adjustment`.
This is typically called by the owner of the `Adjustment` after it has
changed the `Adjustment:value` property.
<!-- enum Align -->
Controls how a widget deals with extra space in a single (x or y)
dimension.

Alignment only matters if the widget receives a “too large” allocation,
for example if you packed the widget with the `Widget:expand`
flag inside a `Box`, then the widget might get extra space. If
you have for example a 16x16 icon inside a 32x32 space, the icon
could be scaled and stretched, it could be centered, or it could be
positioned to one side of the space.

Note that in horizontal context `Align::Start` and `Align::End`
are interpreted relative to text direction.

GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE support for it is optional for containers and widgets, and
it is only supported for vertical alignment. When its not supported by
a child or a container it is treated as `Align::Fill`.
<!-- enum Align::variant Fill -->
stretch to fill all space if possible, center if
 no meaningful way to stretch
<!-- enum Align::variant Start -->
snap to left or top side, leaving space on right
 or bottom
<!-- enum Align::variant End -->
snap to right or bottom side, leaving space on left
 or top
<!-- enum Align::variant Center -->
center natural width of widget inside the
 allocation
<!-- enum Align::variant Baseline -->
align the widget according to the baseline. Since 3.10.
<!-- struct Alignment -->
`[Deprecated since 3.14]` The `Alignment` widget controls the alignment and size of its child widget.
It has four settings: xscale, yscale, xalign, and yalign.

The scale settings are used to specify how much the child widget should
expand to fill the space allocated to the `Alignment`.
The values can range from 0 (meaning the child doesn’t expand at all) to
1 (meaning the child expands to fill all of the available space).

The align settings are used to place the child widget within the available
area. The values range from 0 (top or left) to 1 (bottom or right).
Of course, if the scale settings are both set to 1, the alignment settings
have no effect.

`Alignment` has been deprecated in 3.14 and should not be used in
newly-written code. The desired effect can be achieved by using the
`Widget:halign`, `Widget:valign` and `Widget:margin` properties on the
child widget.

# Implements

<!-- impl Alignment::fn new -->
Creates a new `Alignment`.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Use `Widget` alignment and margin properties
## `xalign`
the horizontal alignment of the child widget, from 0 (left) to 1
 (right).
## `yalign`
the vertical alignment of the child widget, from 0 (top) to 1
 (bottom).
## `xscale`
the amount that the child widget expands horizontally to fill up

the amount that the child widget expands vertically to fill up
 unused space, from 0 to 1. The values are similar to `xscale`.
<!-- impl Alignment::fn set_padding -->
Sets the padding on the different sides of the widget.
The padding adds blank space to the sides of the widget. For instance,
this can be used to indent the child widget towards the right by adding
padding on the left.

<!-- struct AppChooser -->
`AppChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by widgets which
allow the user to choose an application (typically for the purpose of
opening a file). The main objects that implement this interface are
`AppChooserWidget`, `AppChooserDialog` and `AppChooserButton`.

Applications are represented by GIO `gio::AppInfo` objects here.
GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
knows the default and last-used application for a given content
type. The `AppChooserWidget` provides detailed control over
whether the shown list of applications should include default,
recommended or fallback applications.

To obtain the application that has been selected in a `AppChooser`,
use `AppChooser::get_app_info`.

# Implements

<!-- struct AppChooserDialog -->
`AppChooserDialog` shows a `AppChooserWidget` inside a `Dialog`.

Note that `AppChooserDialog` does not have any interesting methods
of its own. Instead, you should get the embedded `AppChooserWidget`
using `AppChooserDialog::get_widget` and call its methods if
the generic `AppChooser` interface is not sufficient for your needs.

To set the heading that is shown above the `AppChooserWidget`,
use `AppChooserDialog::set_heading`.

<!-- struct AppChooserWidget -->
`AppChooserWidget` is a widget for selecting applications.
It is the main building block for `AppChooserDialog`. Most
applications only need to use the latter; but you can use
this widget as part of a larger widget if you have special needs.

`AppChooserWidget` offers detailed control over what applications
are shown, using the
`AppChooserWidget:show-default`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-recommended`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-fallback`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-other` and
`AppChooserWidget:show-all`
properties. See the `AppChooser` documentation for more information
about these groups of applications.

To keep track of the selected application, use the
`AppChooserWidget::application-selected` and `AppChooserWidget::application-activated` signals.

<!-- struct Application -->
`Application` is a class that handles many important aspects
of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
a one-size-fits-all application model.

Currently, `Application` handles GTK+ initialization, application
uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
life-cycle of your application.

While `Application` works fine with plain ``GtkWindows``, it is recommended
to use it together with `ApplicationWindow`.

When GDK threads are enabled, `Application` will acquire the GDK
lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes. The GDK
lock is not touched for local action invocations. In order to have
actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
`gio::ActionGroup::activate_action`. The same applies to actions
associated with `ApplicationWindow` and to the “activate” and
“open” `gio::Application` methods.

## Automatic resources ## {`automatic`-resources}

`Application` will automatically load menus from the `Builder`
file located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
resource base path (see `gio::Application::set_resource_base_path`). The
menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
and accessed via `Application::get_menu_by_id` which allows for
dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.

If the files "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the
value of `Application::prefers_app_menu`.

It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
`Application::set_app_menu` and `Application::set_menubar`.

`Application` will also automatically setup an icon search path for
the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
resources. See `IconTheme::add_resource_path` for more
information.

## A simple application ## {`gtkapplication`}

[A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)

`Application` optionally registers with a session manager
of the users session (if you set the `Application:register-session`
property) and offers various functionality related to the session
life-cycle.

An application can block various ways to end the session with
the `Application::inhibit` function. Typical use cases for
this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
session while inhibitors are present.

[Getting Started with GTK+: Basics](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html`id`-1.2.3.3)

# Implements

[`ApplicationExt`](trait.ApplicationExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ActionGroupExt`](trait.ActionGroupExt.html), [`ActionMapExt`](trait.ActionMapExt.html)
<!-- impl Application::fn new -->
Creates a new `Application` instance.

When using `Application`, it is not necessary to call `gtk_init`
manually. It is called as soon as the application gets registered as
the primary instance.

Concretely, `gtk_init` is called in the default handler for the
`gio::Application::startup` signal. Therefore, `Application` subclasses should
chain up in their `gio::Application::startup` handler before using any GTK+ API.

Note that commandline arguments are not passed to `gtk_init`.
All GTK+ functionality that is available via commandline arguments
can also be achieved by setting suitable environment variables
such as `G_DEBUG`, so this should not be a big
problem. If you absolutely must support GTK+ commandline arguments,
you can explicitly call `gtk_init` before creating the application
instance.

If non-`None`, the application ID must be valid. See
`gio::Application::id_is_valid`.

If no application ID is given then some features (most notably application
uniqueness) will be disabled. A null application ID is only allowed with
GTK+ 3.6 or later.
## `application_id`
The application ID.
## `flags`
the application flags

# Returns

a new `Application` instance
<!-- impl Application::fn add_accelerator -->
Installs an accelerator that will cause the named action
to be activated when the key combination specificed by `accelerator`
is pressed.

`accelerator` must be a string that can be parsed by `gtk_accelerator_parse`,
e.g. "`<Primary>`q" or “`<Control>``<Alt>`p”.

`action_name` must be the name of an action as it would be used
in the app menu, i.e. actions that have been added to the application
are referred to with an “app.” prefix, and window-specific actions
with a “win.” prefix.

`Application` also extracts accelerators out of “accel” attributes
in the `GMenuModels` passed to `Application::set_app_menu` and
`Application::set_menubar`, which is usually more convenient
than calling this function for each accelerator.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Use `Application::set_accels_for_action` instead
## `accelerator`
accelerator string
## `action_name`
the name of the action to activate
## `parameter`
parameter to pass when activating the action,
 or `None` if the action does not accept an activation parameter
<!-- impl Application::fn add_window -->
Adds a window to `self`.

This call is equivalent to setting the `Window:application`
property of `window` to `self`.

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it with `Application::remove_window`.

GTK+ will keep the application running as long as it has
any windows.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- impl Application::fn get_accels_for_action -->
Gets the accelerators that are currently associated with
the given action.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to obtain accelerators for

# Returns

accelerators for `detailed_action_name`, as
 a `None`-terminated array. Free with `g_strfreev` when no longer needed
<!-- impl Application::fn get_actions_for_accel -->
Returns the list of actions (possibly empty) that `accel` maps to.
Each item in the list is a detailed action name in the usual form.

This might be useful to discover if an accel already exists in
order to prevent installation of a conflicting accelerator (from
an accelerator editor or a plugin system, for example). Note that
having more than one action per accelerator may not be a bad thing
and might make sense in cases where the actions never appear in the
same context.

In case there are no actions for a given accelerator, an empty array
is returned. `None` is never returned.

It is a programmer error to pass an invalid accelerator string.
If you are unsure, check it with `gtk_accelerator_parse` first.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `accel`
an accelerator that can be parsed by `gtk_accelerator_parse`

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of actions for `accel`
<!-- impl Application::fn get_active_window -->
Gets the “active” window for the application.

The active window is the one that was most recently focused (within
the application). This window may not have the focus at the moment
if another application has it — this is just the most
recently-focused window within this application.

Feature: `v3_6`


# Returns

the active window
<!-- impl Application::fn get_app_menu -->
Returns the menu model that has been set with
`Application::set_app_menu`.

# Returns

the application menu of `self`
<!-- impl Application::fn get_menu_by_id -->
Gets a menu from automatically loaded resources.
See [Automatic resources][automatic-resources]
for more information.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `id`
the id of the menu to look up

# Returns

Gets the menu with the
 given id from the automatically loaded resources
<!-- impl Application::fn get_menubar -->
Returns the menu model that has been set with
`Application::set_menubar`.

# Returns

the menubar for windows of `self`
<!-- impl Application::fn get_window_by_id -->
Returns the `ApplicationWindow` with the given ID.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `id`
an identifier number

# Returns

the window with ID `id`, or
 `None` if there is no window with this ID
<!-- impl Application::fn get_windows -->
Gets a list of the ``GtkWindows`` associated with `self`.

The list is sorted by most recently focused window, such that the first
element is the currently focused window. (Useful for choosing a parent
for a transient window.)

The list that is returned should not be modified in any way. It will
only remain valid until the next focus change or window creation or
deletion.

# Returns

a `glib::List` of `Window`
<!-- impl Application::fn inhibit -->
Inform the session manager that certain types of actions should be
inhibited. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and for
all types of actions.

Applications should invoke this method when they begin an operation
that should not be interrupted, such as creating a CD or DVD. The
types of actions that may be blocked are specified by the `flags`
parameter. When the application completes the operation it should
call `Application::uninhibit` to remove the inhibitor. Note that
an application can have multiple inhibitors, and all of the must
be individually removed. Inhibitors are also cleared when the
application exits.

Applications should not expect that they will always be able to block
the action. In most cases, users will be given the option to force
the action to take place.

Reasons should be short and to the point.

If `window` is given, the session manager may point the user to
this window to find out more about why the action is inhibited.
## `window`
a `Window`, or `None`
## `flags`
what types of actions should be inhibited
## `reason`
a short, human-readable string that explains
 why these operations are inhibited

# Returns

A non-zero cookie that is used to uniquely identify this
 request. It should be used as an argument to `Application::uninhibit`
 in order to remove the request. If the platform does not support
 inhibiting or the request failed for some reason, 0 is returned.
<!-- impl Application::fn is_inhibited -->
Determines if any of the actions specified in `flags` are
currently inhibited (possibly by another application).
## `flags`
what types of actions should be queried

# Returns

`true` if any of the actions specified in `flags` are inhibited
<!-- impl Application::fn list_action_descriptions -->
Lists the detailed action names which have associated accelerators.
See `Application::set_accels_for_action`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of strings,
 free with `g_strfreev` when done
<!-- impl Application::fn prefers_app_menu -->
Determines if the desktop environment in which the application is
running would prefer an application menu be shown.

If this function returns `true` then the application should call
`Application::set_app_menu` with the contents of an application
menu, which will be shown by the desktop environment. If it returns
`false` then you should consider using an alternate approach, such as
a menubar.

The value returned by this function is purely advisory and you are
free to ignore it. If you call `Application::set_app_menu` even
if the desktop environment doesn't support app menus, then a fallback
will be provided.

Applications are similarly free not to set an app menu even if the
desktop environment wants to show one. In that case, a fallback will
also be created by the desktop environment (GNOME, for example, uses
a menu with only a "Quit" item in it).

The value returned by this function never changes. Once it returns a
particular value, it is guaranteed to always return the same value.

You may only call this function after the application has been
registered and after the base startup handler has run. You're most
likely to want to use this from your own startup handler. It may
also make sense to consult this function while constructing UI (in
activate, open or an action activation handler) in order to determine
if you should show a gear menu or not.

This function will return `false` on Mac OS and a default app menu
will be created automatically with the "usual" contents of that menu
typical to most Mac OS applications. If you call
`Application::set_app_menu` anyway, then this menu will be
replaced with your own.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

`true` if you should set an app menu
<!-- impl Application::fn remove_accelerator -->
Removes an accelerator that has been previously added
with `Application::add_accelerator`.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Use `Application::set_accels_for_action` instead
## `action_name`
the name of the action to activate
## `parameter`
parameter to pass when activating the action,
 or `None` if the action does not accept an activation parameter
<!-- impl Application::fn remove_window -->
Remove a window from `self`.

If `window` belongs to `self` then this call is equivalent to
setting the `Window:application` property of `window` to
`None`.

The application may stop running as a result of a call to this
function.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- impl Application::fn set_accels_for_action -->
Sets zero or more keyboard accelerators that will trigger the
given action. The first item in `accels` will be the primary
accelerator, which may be displayed in the UI.

To remove all accelerators for an action, use an empty, zero-terminated
array for `accels`.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to associate accelerators with
## `accels`
a list of accelerators in the format
 understood by `gtk_accelerator_parse`
<!-- impl Application::fn set_app_menu -->
Sets or unsets the application menu for `self`.

This can only be done in the primary instance of the application,
after it has been registered. `gio::Application::startup` is a good place
to call this.

The application menu is a single menu containing items that typically
impact the application as a whole, rather than acting on a specific
window or document. For example, you would expect to see
“Preferences” or “Quit” in an application menu, but not “Save” or
“Print”.

If supported, the application menu will be rendered by the desktop
environment.

Use the base `gio::ActionMap` interface to add actions, to respond to the user
selecting these menu items.
## `app_menu`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- impl Application::fn set_menubar -->
Sets or unsets the menubar for windows of `self`.

This is a menubar in the traditional sense.

This can only be done in the primary instance of the application,
after it has been registered. `gio::Application::startup` is a good place
to call this.

Depending on the desktop environment, this may appear at the top of
each window, or at the top of the screen. In some environments, if
both the application menu and the menubar are set, the application
menu will be presented as if it were the first item of the menubar.
Other environments treat the two as completely separate — for example,
the application menu may be rendered by the desktop shell while the
menubar (if set) remains in each individual window.

Use the base `gio::ActionMap` interface to add actions, to respond to the
user selecting these menu items.
## `menubar`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- impl Application::fn uninhibit -->
Removes an inhibitor that has been established with `Application::inhibit`.
Inhibitors are also cleared when the application exits.
## `cookie`
a cookie that was returned by `Application::inhibit`
<!-- struct ApplicationWindow -->
`ApplicationWindow` is a `Window` subclass that offers some
extra functionality for better integration with `Application`
features. Notably, it can handle both the application menu as well
as the menubar. See `Application::set_app_menu` and
`Application::set_menubar`.

This class implements the `gio::ActionGroup` and `gio::ActionMap` interfaces,
to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
associated `Application`, together with its application-wide
actions. Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
referring to them from a `gio::MenuModel`.

Note that widgets that are placed inside a `ApplicationWindow`
can also activate these actions, if they implement the
`Actionable` interface.

As with `Application`, the GDK lock will be acquired when
processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore
be held when activating actions locally (if GDK threads are enabled).

The settings `Settings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu` and
`Settings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar` tell GTK+ whether the
desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
on Windows neither will be. gnome-shell (starting with version 3.4)
will display the application menu, but not the menubar.

If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
`ApplicationWindow` will automatically show a `MenuBar` for it.
(see the `Application` docs for some screenshots of how this
looks on different platforms).
This behaviour can be overridden with the `ApplicationWindow:show-menubar`
property. If the desktop environment does not display the application
menu, then it will automatically be included in the menubar. It can
also be shown as part of client-side window decorations, e.g. by
using `HeaderBar::set_show_close_button`.

## A `ApplicationWindow` with a menubar


```C
app = gtk_application_new ();

builder = gtk_builder_new_from_string (
    "<interface>"
    "  <menu id='menubar'>"
    "    <submenu label='_Edit'>"
    "      <item label='_Copy' action='win.copy'/>"
    "      <item label='_Paste' action='win.paste'/>"
    "    </submenu>"
    "  </menu>"
    "</interface>",
    -1);

menubar = G_MENU_MODEL (gtk_builder_get_object (builder,
                                                "menubar"));
gtk_application_set_menubar (G_APPLICATION (app), menubar);
g_object_unref (builder);

...

window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
```

## Handling fallback yourself

[A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/sunny.c)

The XML format understood by `Builder` for `gio::MenuModel` consists
of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
same content model as `<menu>`.

Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other `Builder`
content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
`translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
To make use of this, the `Builder` must have been given the gettext
domain to use.

<!-- struct Arrow -->
`[Deprecated since 3.14]` `Arrow` should be used to draw simple arrows that need to point in
one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right). The
style of the arrow can be one of shadow in, shadow out, etched in, or
etched out. Note that these directions and style types may be
amended in versions of GTK+ to come.

`Arrow` will fill any space alloted to it, but since it is inherited
from `Misc`, it can be padded and/or aligned, to fill exactly the
space the programmer desires.

Arrows are created with a call to `Arrow::new`. The direction or
style of an arrow can be changed after creation by using `Arrow::set`.

`Arrow` has been deprecated; you can simply use a `Image` with a
suitable icon name, such as “pan-down-symbolic“. When replacing
`Arrow` by an image, pay attention to the fact that `Arrow` is
doing automatic flipping between `ArrowType::Left` and `ArrowType::Right`,
depending on the text direction. To get the same effect with an image,
use the icon names “pan-start-symbolic“ and “pan-end-symbolic“, which
react to the text direction instead of “pan-left-symbolic“ and
“pan-right-symbolic“ which don't.

<!-- struct AspectFrame -->
The `AspectFrame` is useful when you want
pack a widget so that it can resize but always retains
the same aspect ratio. For instance, one might be
drawing a small preview of a larger image. `AspectFrame`
derives from `Frame`, so it can draw a label and
a frame around the child. The frame will be
“shrink-wrapped” to the size of the child.

<!-- enum AssistantPageType -->
An enum for determining the page role inside the `Assistant`. It's
used to handle buttons sensitivity and visibility.

Note that an assistant needs to end its page flow with a page of type
`AssistantPageType::Confirm`, `AssistantPageType::Summary` or
`AssistantPageType::Progress` to be correct.

The Cancel button will only be shown if the page isn’t “committed”.
See `Assistant::commit` for details.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Content -->
The page has regular contents. Both the
 Back and forward buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Intro -->
The page contains an introduction to the
 assistant task. Only the Forward button will be shown if there is a
 next page.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Confirm -->
The page lets the user confirm or deny the
 changes. The Back and Apply buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Summary -->
The page informs the user of the changes
 done. Only the Close button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Progress -->
Used for tasks that take a long time to
 complete, blocks the assistant until the page is marked as complete.
 Only the back button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Custom -->
Used for when other page types are not
 appropriate. No buttons will be shown, and the application must
 add its own buttons through `Assistant::add_action_widget`.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition -->
Whenever a container has some form of natural row it may align
children in that row along a common typographical baseline. If
the amount of verical space in the row is taller than the total
requested height of the baseline-aligned children then it can use a
`BaselinePosition` to select where to put the baseline inside the
extra availible space.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Top -->
Align the baseline at the top
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Center -->
Center the baseline
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Bottom -->
Align the baseline at the bottom

<!-- struct Bin -->
The `Bin` widget is a container with just one child.
It is not very useful itself, but it is useful for deriving subclasses,
since it provides common code needed for handling a single child widget.

Many GTK+ widgets are subclasses of `Bin`, including `Window`,
`Button`, `Frame`, `HandleBox` or `ScrolledWindow`.

<!-- struct Box -->
The `Box` widget organizes child widgets into a rectangular area.

The rectangular area of a `Box` is organized into either a single row
or a single column of child widgets depending upon the orientation.
Thus, all children of a `Box` are allocated one dimension in common,
which is the height of a row, or the width of a column.

`Box` uses a notion of packing. Packing refers
to adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
`Container`. For a `Box`, there are two reference positions: the
start and the end of the box.
For a vertical `Box`, the start is defined as the top of the box and
the end is defined as the bottom. For a horizontal `Box` the start
is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right side.

Use repeated calls to `BoxExt::pack_start` to pack widgets into a
`Box` from start to end. Use `BoxExt::pack_end` to add widgets from
end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
both ends of the same `Box`.

Because `Box` is a `Container`, you may also use `Container::add`
to insert widgets into the box, and they will be packed with the default
values for expand and fill child properties. Use `Container::remove`
to remove widgets from the `Box`.

Use `BoxExt::set_homogeneous` to specify whether or not all children
of the `Box` are forced to get the same amount of space.

Use `BoxExt::set_spacing` to determine how much space will be
minimally placed between all children in the `Box`. Note that
spacing is added between the children, while
padding added by `BoxExt::pack_start` or `BoxExt::pack_end` is added
on either side of the widget it belongs to.

Use `BoxExt::reorder_child` to move a `Box` child to a different
place in the box.

Use `BoxExt::set_child_packing` to reset the expand,
fill and padding child properties.
Use `BoxExt::query_child_packing` to query these fields.

Note that a single-row or single-column `Grid` provides exactly
the same functionality as `Box`.

<!-- trait BoxExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the end of `self`.
The `child` is packed after (away from end of) any other child
packed with reference to the end of `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
## `expand`
`true` if the new child is to be given extra space allocated
 to `self`. The extra space will be divided evenly between all children
 of `self` that use this option
## `fill`
`true` if space given to `child` by the `expand` option is
 actually allocated to `child`, rather than just padding it. This
 parameter has no effect if `expand` is set to `false`. A child is
 always allocated the full height of a horizontal `Box` and the full width
 of a vertical `Box`. This option affects the other dimension
## `padding`
extra space in pixels to put between this child and its
 neighbors, over and above the global amount specified by
 `Box:spacing` property. If `child` is a widget at one of the
 reference ends of `self`, then `padding` pixels are also put between
 `child` and the reference edge of `self`
<!-- trait BoxExt::fn pack_start -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the start of `self`.
The `child` is packed after any other child packed with reference
to the start of `self`.

<!-- trait BoxExt::fn reorder_child -->
Moves `child` to a new `position` in the list of `self` children.
The list contains widgets packed `PackType::Start`
as well as widgets packed `PackType::End`, in the order that these
widgets were added to `self`.

A widget’s position in the `self` children list determines where
the widget is packed into `self`. A child widget at some position
in the list will be packed just after all other widgets of the
same packing type that appear earlier in the list.
## `child`
the `Widget` to move
## `position`
the new position for `child` in the list of children
 of `self`, starting from 0. If negative, indicates the end of
 the list
<!-- trait BoxExt::fn set_baseline_position -->
Sets the baseline position of a box. This affects
only horizontal boxes with at least one baseline aligned
child. If there is more vertical space available than requested,
and the baseline is not allocated by the parent then
`position` is used to allocate the baseline wrt the
extra space available.

 `false` for variable allotments
<!-- trait BoxExt::fn set_spacing -->
Sets the `Box:spacing` property of `self`, which is the
number of pixels to place between children of `self`.
## `spacing`

<!-- struct Builder -->
A `Builder` is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
a `Builder` from a user interface description, call
`Builder::new_from_file`, `Builder::new_from_resource` or
`Builder::new_from_string`.

In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
descriptions from multiple sources to the same `Builder` you can
call `Builder::new` to get an empty builder and populate it by
(multiple) calls to `Builder::add_from_file`,
`Builder::add_from_resource` or `Builder::add_from_string`.

A `Builder` holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call `Widget::destroy`
to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.

The functions `Builder::get_object` and `Builder::get_objects`
can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
with `Widget::destroy`. Other widgets will either be part of a
larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
Non-widget objects need to be reffed with `gobject::Object::ref` to keep them
beyond the lifespan of the builder.

The function `Builder::connect_signals` and variants thereof can be
used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.

# `Builder` UI Definitions # {`BUILDER`-UI}

`Builder` parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “`Builder`
UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
Do not confuse `Builder` UI Definitions with
[`UIManager` UI Definitions][XML-UI], which are more limited in scope.
It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
`Builder` UI definitions.

[RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)

The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
using `dgettext` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
calling `Builder::set_translation_domain` on the builder.
Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
`<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A `<child>`
element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. The builder will error
out if the version requirements are not met.

Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type` function from the
class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type` function
explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, `Builder`
allows to use an object that has been constructed by a `UIManager` in
another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the `UIManager`
in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
attribute.

Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
application to retrieve them from the builder with `Builder::get_object`.
An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
with ___ (3 underscores) for its own purposes.

Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
`<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
`gettext` (or `dgettext` if the builder has a translation domain set)
to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
may help the translators.

`Builder` can parse textual representations for the most common
property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
as `true`, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
as `false`), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
and colors (in a format understood by `gdk::RGBA::parse`). Pixbufs can
be specified as a filename of an image file to load. Objects can be
referred to by their name and by default refer to objects declared
in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
`Builder::expose_object`.

In general, `Builder` allows forward references to objects —
declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t have to be constructed
before it can be referred to. The exception to this rule is that an
object has to be constructed before it can be used as the value of
a construct-only property.

It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
property value using the attributes
"bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
"bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
"bind-flags" to specify the binding flags
Internally builder implement this using GBinding objects.
For more information see `gobject::Object::bind_property`

Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
to find the handler using `gmodule::Module::symbol`, but this can be changed by
passing a custom ``GtkBuilderConnectFunc`` to
`Builder::connect_signals_full`. The remaining attributes, “after”,
“swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
parameters of the `g_signal_connect_object` or
`g_signal_connect_data` functions. A “last_modification_time”
attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
builder.

Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the `vbox` of
a `Dialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
propery of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that `Builder`
still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
has already been constructed.

A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
(e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

# A `Builder` UI Definition


```text
<interface>
  <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
    <child internal-child="vbox">
      <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1">
        <property name="border-width">10</property>
        <child internal-child="action_area">
          <object class="GtkButtonBox" id="hbuttonbox1">
            <property name="border-width">20</property>
            <child>
              <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                <property name="label">gtk-ok</property>
                <property name="use-stock">TRUE</property>
                <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
```

Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their
own XML DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD
above. Note that a custom element in a `<child>` element gets parsed by
the custom tag handler of the parent object, while a custom element in
an `<object>` element gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.

These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the
respective objects.

Additionally, since 3.10 a special `<template>` tag has been added
to the format allowing one to define a widget class’s components.
See the [`Widget` documentation][composite-templates] for details.

# Implements

<!-- impl Builder::fn new -->
Creates a new empty builder object.

This function is only useful if you intend to make multiple calls
to `Builder::add_from_file`, `Builder::add_from_resource`
or `Builder::add_from_string` in order to merge multiple UI
descriptions into a single builder.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`,
`Builder::new_from_resource` or `Builder::new_from_string`.

# Returns

a new (empty) `Builder` object
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_file -->
Builds the [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
in the file `filename`.

If there is an error opening the file or parsing the description then
the program will be aborted. You should only ever attempt to parse
user interface descriptions that are shipped as part of your program.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `filename`
filename of user interface description file

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_resource -->

If there is an error locating the resource or parsing the
description, then the program will be aborted.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `resource_path`
a `gio::Resource` resource path

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_string -->
Builds the user interface described by `string` (in the
[`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI] format).

If `string` is `None`-terminated, then `length` should be -1.
If `length` is not -1, then it is the length of `string`.

If there is an error parsing `string` then the program will be
aborted. You should not attempt to parse user interface description
from untrusted sources.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `string`
a user interface (XML) description
## `length`
the length of `string`, or -1

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the interface described by `string`
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_callback_symbol -->
Adds the `callback_symbol` to the scope of `self` under the given `callback_name`.

Using this function overrides the behavior of `Builder::connect_signals`
for any callback symbols that are added. Using this method allows for better
encapsulation as it does not require that callback symbols be declared in
the global namespace.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `callback_name`
The name of the callback, as expected in the XML
## `callback_symbol`
The callback pointer
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_callback_symbols -->

The name of the callback, as expected in the XML
## `first_callback_symbol`
The callback pointer
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_from_file -->
Parses a file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. You should not use this function with untrusted files (ie:
files that are not part of your application). Broken `Builder`
files can easily crash your program, and it’s possible that memory
was leaked leading up to the reported failure. The only reasonable
thing to do when an error is detected is to call `g_error`.
## `filename`
the name of the file to parse

# Returns

A positive value on success, 0 if an error occurred
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_from_resource -->
Parses a resource file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]

`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or
`G_VARIANT_PARSE_ERROR` domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error`.

them with the current contents of `self`.

Upon errors 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `TreeView` that depends on its
`TreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.

<!-- impl Builder::fn connect_signals -->
This method is a simpler variation of `Builder::connect_signals_full`.
It uses symbols explicitly added to `self` with prior calls to
`Builder::add_callback_symbol`. In the case that symbols are not
explicitly added; it uses `gmodule::Module`’s introspective features (by opening the module `None`)
to look at the application’s symbol table. From here it tries to match
the signal handler names given in the interface description with
symbols in the application and connects the signals. Note that this
function can only be called once, subsequent calls will do nothing.

Note that unless `Builder::add_callback_symbol` is called for
all signal callbacks which are referenced by the loaded XML, this
function will require that `gmodule::Module` be supported on the platform.

If you rely on `gmodule::Module` support to lookup callbacks in the symbol table,
the following details should be noted:

When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
with `G_MODULE_EXPORT`, or they will not be put in the symbol table.
On Linux and Unices, this is not necessary; applications should instead
be compiled with the -Wl,--export-dynamic CFLAGS, and linked against
gmodule-export-2.0.
## `user_data`
user data to pass back with all signals
<!-- impl Builder::fn connect_signals_full -->
This function can be thought of the interpreted language binding
version of `Builder::connect_signals`, except that it does not
require GModule to function correctly.
## `func`
the function used to connect the signals
## `user_data`
arbitrary data that will be passed to the connection function
<!-- impl Builder::fn expose_object -->
Add `object` to the `self` object pool so it can be referenced just like any
other object built by builder.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `name`
the name of the object exposed to the builder
## `object`
the object to expose
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_application -->
Gets the `Application` associated with the builder.

The `Application` is used for creating action proxies as requested
from XML that the builder is loading.

By default, the builder uses the default application: the one from
`gio::Application::get_default`. If you want to use another application
for constructing proxies, use `Builder::set_application`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the application being used by the builder,
 or `None`
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_object -->
Gets the object named `name`. Note that this function does not
increment the reference count of the returned object.

name of object to get

# Returns

the object named `name` or `None` if
 it could not be found in the object tree.
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_objects -->
Gets all objects that have been constructed by `self`. Note that
this function does not increment the reference counts of the returned
objects.

# Returns

a newly-allocated `glib::SList` containing all the objects
 constructed by the `Builder` instance. It should be freed by
 `glib::SList::free`
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_translation_domain -->
Gets the translation domain of `self`.

# Returns

the translation domain. This string is owned
by the builder object and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_type_from_name -->
Looks up a type by name, using the virtual function that
`Builder` has for that purpose. This is mainly used when
implementing the `Buildable` interface on a type.
## `type_name`
type name to lookup

# Returns

the `glib::Type` found for `type_name` or `G_TYPE_INVALID`
 if no type was found
<!-- impl Builder::fn lookup_callback_symbol -->
Fetches a symbol previously added to `self`
with `Builder::add_callback_symbols`

This function is intended for possible use in language bindings
or for any case that one might be cusomizing signal connections
using `Builder::connect_signals_full`

Feature: `v3_10`

## `callback_name`
The name of the callback

# Returns

The callback symbol in `self` for `callback_name`, or `None`
<!-- impl Builder::fn set_application -->

You only need this function if there is more than one `gio::Application`
in your process. `application` cannot be `None`.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `application`
a `Application`
<!-- impl Builder::fn set_translation_domain -->
Sets the translation domain of `self`.
See `Builder:translation-domain`.
## `domain`
the translation domain or `None`
<!-- impl Builder::fn value_from_string -->
This function demarshals a value from a string. This function
calls `gobject::Value::init` on the `value` argument, so it need not be
initialised beforehand.

This function can handle char, uchar, boolean, int, uint, long,
ulong, enum, flags, float, double, string, `gdk::Color`, `gdk::RGBA` and
`Adjustment` type values. Support for `Widget` type values is
still to come.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.
## `pspec`
the `gobject::ParamSpec` for the property
## `string`
the string representation of the value
## `value`
the `gobject::Value` to store the result in

# Returns

`true` on success
<!-- impl Builder::fn value_from_string_type -->
Like `Builder::value_from_string`, this function demarshals
a value from a string, but takes a `glib::Type` instead of `gobject::ParamSpec`.
This function calls `gobject::Value::init` on the `value` argument, so it
need not be initialised beforehand.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.
## `type_`
the `glib::Type` of the value
## `string`
the string representation of the value
## `value`
the `gobject::Value` to store the result in

The `Button` widget is generally used to trigger a callback function that is
called when the button is pressed. The various signals and how to use them
are outlined below.

The `Button` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it can hold
almost any other standard `Widget`. The most commonly used child is the
`Label`.

This group appears after the other children if the style
is `ButtonBoxStyle::Start`, `ButtonBoxStyle::Spread` or
`ButtonBoxStyle::Edge`, and before the other children if the style
is `ButtonBoxStyle::End`. For horizontal button boxes, the definition
of before/after depends on direction of the widget (see
`Widget::set_direction`). If the style is `ButtonBoxStyle::Start`
or `ButtonBoxStyle::End`, then the secondary children are aligned at
the other end of the button box from the main children. For the
other styles, they appear immediately next to the main children.

<!-- struct Calendar -->
`Calendar` is a widget that displays a Gregorian calendar, one month
at a time. It can be created with `Calendar::new`.

The month and year currently displayed can be altered with
`Calendar::select_month`. The exact day can be selected from the
displayed month using `Calendar::select_day`.

To place a visual marker on a particular day, use `Calendar::mark_day`
and to remove the marker, `Calendar::unmark_day`. Alternative, all
marks can be cleared with `Calendar::clear_marks`.

The way in which the calendar itself is displayed can be altered using
`Calendar::set_display_options`.

The selected date can be retrieved from a `Calendar` using
`Calendar::get_date`.

Users should be aware that, although the Gregorian calendar is the
legal calendar in most countries, it was adopted progressively
between 1582 and 1929. Display before these dates is likely to be
historically incorrect.

<!-- struct CellArea -->
The `CellArea` is an abstract class for `CellLayout` widgets
(also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with an
arbitrary number of ``GtkCellRenderers`` and interact with the user
for a given `TreeModel` row.

The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
size requests and allocations for a given row of data.

Usually users dont have to interact with the `CellArea` directly
unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.

# Requesting area sizes

As outlined in
[`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management],
GTK+ uses a height-for-width
geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
interfaces. `CellArea` uses the same semantics to calculate the
size of an area for an arbitrary number of `TreeModel` rows.

When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
different layouting widgets. For instance a `TreeViewColumn`
always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a `IconView`
on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
areas when allocated less width.

It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
cells are different in each row). For this reason the `CellArea`
uses a `CellAreaContext` object to store the alignments
and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
with the said context).

The `CellAreaContext` is an opaque object specific to the
`CellArea` which created it (see `CellAreaExt::create_context`).
The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
However, it’s important that the same `CellAreaContext` which
was used to request the sizes for a given `TreeModel` row be
used when rendering or processing events for that row.

In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
gint        minimum_width;
gint        natural_width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
```

Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
in the accompanying `CellAreaContext` object and can be consulted
at any time.

This can be useful since `CellLayout` widgets usually have to
support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
exceedingly large amount of rows. The `CellLayout` widget in
that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
idle or timeout source (see `g_timeout_add`) and when the widget
is requested its actual width in `WidgetClass.get_preferred_width`()
it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
`CellAreaContext` object.

A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:


```C
static void
foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget       *widget,
                         gint            *minimum_size,
                         gint            *natural_size)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;

  foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (foo);

  gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
}
```

In the above example the Foo widget has to make sure that some
row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that Foo judged
was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
the `CellAreaContext`.

Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
a similar task except in this case the `CellAreaContext` does not
store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
width which was requested by the `CellArea`).

In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
root level of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
gint        minimum_height;
gint        natural_height;
gint        full_minimum_height = 0;
gint        full_natural_height = 0;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
                                                  width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);

    if (width_is_for_allocation)
       cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);

    full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
    full_natural_height += natural_height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
allocation.

In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
who need to request size for tens of thousands of rows. For this
case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
call to `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width`(). Returning
a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
values while more and more height is required for the row heights
that are calculated in the background.

# Rendering Areas

Once area sizes have been aquired at least for the rows in the
visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
`WidgetClass.draw`() time.

A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
runs as follows:


```C
GtkAllocation allocation;
GdkRectangle  cell_area = { 0, };
GtkTreeIter   iter;
gint          minimum_width;
gint          natural_width;

gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
cell_area.width = allocation.width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);

    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
                          &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);

    cell_area.y += cell_area.height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
`Widget::size-allocate` time using `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation`.

# Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus

Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
normal widget and then passing them to the `CellAreaExt::event`
API as they come in. Usually `CellArea` is only interested in
button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
trigger the `CellArea::focus-changed` signal to fire; as well as
`CellArea::add-editable` in the case that an editable cell was
clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
`CellAreaExt::stop_editing` at any time to cancel any cell editing
that is currently in progress.

The `CellArea` drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
similar to `Widget`. For layouting widgets that support giving
focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass `CellRendererState::Focused`
to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
area to paint the focus at render time.

Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
`WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method. The layouting widget is always
responsible for knowing where `TreeModel` rows are rendered inside
the widget, so at `WidgetClass.focus`() time the layouting widget
should use the `CellArea` methods to navigate focus inside the area
and then observe the `DirectionType` to pass the focus to adjacent
rows and areas.

A basic example of how the `WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method
should be implemented:


```C
static gboolean
foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
           GtkDirectionType direction)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
  gint        focus_row;
  gboolean    have_focus = FALSE;

  focus_row = priv->focus_row;

  if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
    gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);

  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
  while (valid)
    {
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);

      if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
        {
           priv->focus_row = focus_row;
           have_focus = TRUE;
           break;
        }
      else
        {
          if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
              direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
            break;
          else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
                   direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
           {
              if (focus_row == 0)
                break;
              else
               {
                  focus_row--;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
               }
            }
          else
            {
              if (focus_row == last_row)
                break;
              else
                {
                  focus_row++;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return have_focus;
}
```

Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
`DirectionType` values to the way it lays out its cells.

# Cell Properties

The `CellArea` introduces cell properties for ``GtkCellRenderers``
in very much the same way that `Container` introduces
[child properties][child-properties]
for ``GtkWidgets``. This provides some general interfaces for defining
the relationship cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a
`CellAreaBox` a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when
the area is allocated more than its full natural request, or a cell
might be configured to “align” with adjacent rows which were requested
and rendered with the same `CellAreaContext`.

Use `CellAreaClass::install_cell_property` to install cell
properties for a cell area class and `CellAreaClass::find_cell_property`
or `CellAreaClass::list_cell_properties` to get information about
existing cell properties.

To set the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_set_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_set` or `CellAreaExt::cell_set_valist`. To obtain
the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_get_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_get` or `CellAreaExt::cell_get_valist`.

a separate collective height. `IconView` uses this to
request the heights of each row based on a context which

Implementing `CellArea` classes should implement this
method to receive and navigate focus in its own way particular
to how it lays out cells.

on each cell area individually to get the height for width of each
fully requested row.

`CellAreaClass.focus`() or `CellAreaClass.event`(),
however it can also be used to implement functions such
as `TreeView::set_cursor_on_cell`.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to give focus to
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn stop_editing -->
Explicitly stops the editing of the currently edited cell.

## `canceled`
whether editing was canceled.
<!-- struct CellAreaBox -->
The `CellAreaBox` renders cell renderers into a row or a column
depending on its `Orientation`.

`CellAreaBox` uses a notion of packing. Packing
refers to adding cell renderers with reference to a particular position
in a `CellAreaBox`. There are two reference positions: the
start and the end of the box.
When the `CellAreaBox` is oriented in the `Orientation::Vertical`
orientation, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
defined as the bottom. In the `Orientation::Horizontal` orientation
start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right
side.

Alignments of ``GtkCellRenderers`` rendered in adjacent rows can be
configured by configuring the `CellAreaBox` align child cell property
with `CellArea::cell_set_property` or by specifying the "align"
argument to `CellAreaBox::pack_start` and `CellAreaBox::pack_end`.

<!-- struct CellAreaContext -->
The `CellAreaContext` object is created by a given `CellArea`
implementation via its `CellAreaClass.create_context`() virtual
method and is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
`TreeModel` rows that are requested and rendered in the same context.

`CellLayout` widgets can create any number of contexts in which to
request and render groups of data rows. However, it’s important that the
same context which was used to request sizes for a given `TreeModel`
row also be used for the same row when calling other `CellArea` APIs
such as `CellAreaExt::render` and `CellAreaExt::event`.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn allocate -->
Allocates a width and/or a height for all rows which are to be
rendered with `self`.

Usually allocation is performed only horizontally or sometimes
vertically since a group of rows are usually rendered side by
side vertically or horizontally and share either the same width
or the same height. Sometimes they are allocated in both horizontal
and vertical orientations producing a homogeneous effect of the
rows. This is generally the case for `TreeView` when
`TreeView:fixed-height-mode` is enabled.

Since 3.0
## `width`
the allocated width for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
## `height`
the allocated height for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn get_allocation -->
Fetches the current allocation size for `self`.

If the context was not allocated in width or height, or if the
context was recently reset with `CellAreaContext::reset`,
the returned value will be -1.
## `width`
location to store the allocated width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the allocated height, or `None`
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn get_area -->
Fetches the `CellArea` this `self` was created by.

This is generally unneeded by layouting widgets; however,
it is important for the context implementation itself to
fetch information about the area it is being used for.

For instance at `CellAreaContextClass.allocate`() time
it’s important to know details about any cell spacing
that the `CellArea` is configured with in order to
compute a proper allocation.

# Returns

the `CellArea` this context was created by.
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn get_preferred_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for all rows which have been
requested with this context.

After `CellAreaContext::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are 0.
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height,
 or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height,
 or `None`
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn get_preferred_height_for_width -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for `width` for all rows
which have been requested for the same said `width` with this context.

After `CellAreaContext::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `width`

<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn get_preferred_width_for_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred width for `height` for all rows which

requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `height`

## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width,
 or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width,
 or `None`
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn push_preferred_height -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural height to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural height.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested height over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height` requests.
## `minimum_height`
the proposed new minimum height for `self`
## `natural_height`
the proposed new natural height for `self`
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn push_preferred_width -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural width to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural width.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested width over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` requests.
## `minimum_width`
the proposed new minimum width for `self`
## `natural_width`
the proposed new natural width for `self`
<!-- impl CellAreaContext::fn reset -->
Resets any previously cached request and allocation
data.

When underlying `TreeModel` data changes its
important to reset the context if the content
size is allowed to shrink. If the content size
is only allowed to grow (this is usually an option
for views rendering large data stores as a measure
of optimization), then only the row that changed
or was inserted needs to be (re)requested with
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`.

When the new overall size of the context requires
that the allocated size changes (or whenever this
allocation changes at all), the variable row
sizes need to be re-requested for every row.

For instance, if the rows are displayed all with
the same width from top to bottom then a change
in the allocated width necessitates a recalculation
of all the displayed row heights using
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height_for_width`.

<!-- struct CellLayout -->
`CellLayout` is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
want to provide a `TreeViewColumn` like API for packing cells,
setting attributes and data funcs.

One of the notable features provided by implementations of
`CellLayout` are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
tree model with `CellLayout::set_attributes`, which means that the value
of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
`CellLayout::set_cell_data_func` that is called to determine the
value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.

# `GtkCellLayouts` as `Buildable`

Implementations of `CellLayout` which also implement the `Buildable`
interface (`CellView`, `IconView`, `ComboBox`,
`EntryCompletion`, `TreeViewColumn`) accept `CellRenderer` objects
as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
attribute value.

This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:

```C
combo = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
```

to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
are only initialized after instance `init`
functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
the existence of the cell area in your subclass’ `init` function will
cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
you to the problem).


```C
static void
my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
{
  GtkCellRenderer *cell;

  cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();
  // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
  // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
  gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
  ...
}

GtkWidget *
my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
{
  // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
  return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
}
```

If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
problematic calls out of `init` and into a `constructor`
for your class.

<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`.

The `column` is the column of the model to get a value from, and the
`attribute` is the parameter on `cell` to be set from the value. So for
example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from column 2.

## `attribute`
an attribute on the renderer
## `column`

 been newly allocated and should be freed with `glib::List::free`
 when no longer needed.
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to the end of `self`. If `expand` is `false`, then the
`cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is
divided evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.
## `cell`

## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of `self`. If `expand` is `false`,

<!-- struct CellRenderer -->
The `CellRenderer` is a base class of a set of objects used for
rendering a cell to a `cairo::Context`. These objects are used primarily by
the `TreeView` widget, though they aren’t tied to them in any
specific way. It is worth noting that `CellRenderer` is not a
`Widget` and cannot be treated as such.

The primary use of a `CellRenderer` is for drawing a certain graphical
elements on a `cairo::Context`. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
draw many cells on the screen. To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
CellRenderer keep any permanent state around. Instead, any state is set
just prior to use using `GObjects` property system. Then, the
cell is measured using `CellRenderer::get_size`. Finally, the cell
is rendered in the correct location using `CellRendererExt::render`.

There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
`CellRenderer`. First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
barring a `Style` change. The `CellRenderer` also has a number of
generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.

Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
“activatable” like `CellRendererToggle`,
which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
“editable” like `CellRendererText`, which
allows the user to edit the text using a `Entry`.
To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
implement the `CellRendererClass.activate` or
`CellRendererClass.start_editing` virtual functions, respectively.

Many properties of `CellRenderer` and its subclasses have a
corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

Sets the cell renderer’s sensitivity.
## `sensitive`
the sensitivity of the cell
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the cell renderer’s visibility.
## `visible`
the visibility of the cell
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn start_editing -->
Passes an activate event to the cell renderer for possible processing.
## `event`
a ``GdkEvent``
## `widget`
widget that received the event

# Returns

A new `CellEditable`, or `None`
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn stop_editing -->
Informs the cell renderer that the editing is stopped.
If `canceled` is `true`, the cell renderer will emit the
`CellRenderer::editing-canceled` signal.

This function should be called by cell renderer implementations
in response to the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal of
`CellEditable`.
## `canceled`
`true` if the editing has been canceled
<!-- struct CellRendererAccel -->
`CellRendererAccel` displays a keyboard accelerator (i.e. a key
combination like `Control + a`). If the cell renderer is editable,
the accelerator can be changed by simply typing the new combination.

The `CellRendererAccel` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.

# Implements

[`CellRendererTextExt`](trait.CellRendererTextExt.html), [`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererAccel`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- enum CellRendererAccelMode -->
Determines if the edited accelerators are GTK+ accelerators. If
they are, consumed modifiers are suppressed, only accelerators
accepted by GTK+ are allowed, and the accelerators are rendered
in the same way as they are in menus.
<!-- enum CellRendererAccelMode::variant Gtk -->
GTK+ accelerators mode
<!-- enum CellRendererAccelMode::variant Other -->
Other accelerator mode
GTK_CELL_RENDERER_ACCEL_MODE_MODIFIER_TAP: Bare modifiers mode
<!-- struct CellRendererCombo -->
`CellRendererCombo` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererCombo` offers a `ComboBox`
widget to edit the text. The values to display in the combo box are taken from
the tree model specified in the `CellRendererCombo:model` property.

The combo cell renderer takes care of adding a text cell renderer to the combo
box and sets it to display the column specified by its
`CellRendererCombo:text-column` property. Further properties of the combo box
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

The `CellRendererCombo` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.6.

# Implements

[`CellRendererTextExt`](trait.CellRendererTextExt.html), [`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererCombo`.
Adjust how text is drawn using object properties.
Object properties can be set globally (with `gobject::Object::set`).
Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you can bind a property to a value
in a `TreeModel`. For example, you can bind the “text” property
on the cell renderer to a string value in the model, thus rendering
a different string in each row of the `TreeView`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- enum CellRendererMode -->
Identifies how the user can interact with a particular cell.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Inert -->
The cell is just for display
 and cannot be interacted with. Note that this doesn’t mean that eg. the
 row being drawn can’t be selected -- just that a particular element of
 it cannot be individually modified.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Activatable -->
The cell can be clicked.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Editable -->
The cell can be edited or otherwise modified.
<!-- struct CellRendererPixbuf -->
A `CellRendererPixbuf` can be used to render an image in a cell. It allows
to render either a given `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf` property) or a named icon (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:icon-name` property).

To support the tree view, `CellRendererPixbuf` also supports rendering two
alternative pixbufs, when the `CellRenderer:is-expander` property is `true`.
If the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `true` and the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-open` property is set to a pixbuf, it
renders that pixbuf, if the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `false`
and the `CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-closed` property is set to a
pixbuf, it renders that one.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererPixbuf::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererPixbuf`. Adjust rendering
parameters using object properties. Object properties can be set
globally (with `gobject::Object::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you
can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example, you
can bind the “pixbuf” property on the cell renderer to a pixbuf value
in the model, thus rendering a different image in each row of the
`TreeView`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- struct CellRendererProgress -->
`CellRendererProgress` renders a numeric value as a progress par in a cell.
Additionally, it can display a text on top of the progress bar.

The `CellRendererProgress` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.6.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererProgress`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- struct CellRendererSpin -->
`CellRendererSpin` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererSpin` offers a `SpinButton` widget. Of course,
that means that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.

The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the
cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the
tree model, like all properties of cell renders. `CellRendererSpin`
also has properties for the `CellRendererSpin:climb-rate` and the number
of `CellRendererSpin:digits` to display. Other `SpinButton` properties
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

The `CellRendererSpin` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.

# Implements

[`CellRendererTextExt`](trait.CellRendererTextExt.html), [`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererSpin::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererSpin`.

# Returns

a new `CellRendererSpin`
<!-- struct CellRendererSpinner -->
`CellRendererSpinner` renders a spinning animation in a cell, very
similar to `Spinner`. It can often be used as an alternative
to a `CellRendererProgress` for displaying indefinite activity,
instead of actual progress.

To start the animation in a cell, set the `CellRendererSpinner:active`
property to `true` and increment the `CellRendererSpinner:pulse` property
at regular intervals. The usual way to set the cell renderer properties
for each cell is to bind them to columns in your tree model using e.g.
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn new -->
Returns a new cell renderer which will show a spinner to indicate
activity.

# Returns

a new `CellRenderer`
<!-- struct CellRendererText -->
A `CellRendererText` renders a given text in its cell, using the font, color and
style information provided by its properties. The text will be ellipsized if it is
too long and the `CellRendererText:ellipsize` property allows it.

If the `CellRenderer:mode` is `CellRendererMode::Editable`,
the `CellRendererText` allows to edit its text using an entry.

# Implements

[`CellRendererTextExt`](trait.CellRendererTextExt.html), [`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt -->

<!-- impl CellRendererText::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererText`. Adjust how text is drawn using
object properties. Object properties can be
set globally (with `gobject::Object::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`,
you can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example,
you can bind the “text” property on the cell renderer to a string
value in the model, thus rendering a different string in each row
of the `TreeView`

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_fixed_height_from_font -->
Sets the height of a renderer to explicitly be determined by the “font” and
“y_pad” property set on it. Further changes in these properties do not
affect the height, so they must be accompanied by a subsequent call to this
function. Using this function is unflexible, and should really only be used
if calculating the size of a cell is too slow (ie, a massive number of cells
displayed). If `number_of_rows` is -1, then the fixed height is unset, and
the height is determined by the properties again.
## `number_of_rows`
Number of rows of text each cell renderer is allocated, or -1
<!-- struct CellRendererToggle -->
`CellRendererToggle` renders a toggle button in a cell. The
button is drawn as a radio or a checkbutton, depending on the
`CellRendererToggle:radio` property.
When activated, it emits the `CellRendererToggle::toggled` signal.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererToggle`. Adjust rendering
parameters using object properties. Object properties can be set
globally (with `gobject::Object::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you
can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example, you
can bind the “active” property on the cell renderer to a boolean value
in the model, thus causing the check button to reflect the state of
the model.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn get_activatable -->
Returns whether the cell renderer is activatable. See
`CellRendererToggle::set_activatable`.

# Returns

`true` if the cell renderer is activatable.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn get_active -->
Returns whether the cell renderer is active. See
`CellRendererToggle::set_active`.

# Returns

`true` if the cell renderer is active.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn get_radio -->
Returns whether we’re rendering radio toggles rather than checkboxes.

# Returns

`true` if we’re rendering radio toggles rather than checkboxes
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn set_activatable -->
Makes the cell renderer activatable.
## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn set_active -->
Activates or deactivates a cell renderer.
## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn set_radio -->
If `radio` is `true`, the cell renderer renders a radio toggle
(i.e. a toggle in a group of mutually-exclusive toggles).
If `false`, it renders a check toggle (a standalone boolean option).
This can be set globally for the cell renderer, or changed just
before rendering each cell in the model (for `TreeView`, you set
up a per-row setting using `TreeViewColumn` to associate model
columns with cell renderer properties).
## `radio`
`true` to make the toggle look like a radio button
<!-- struct CheckButton -->
A `CheckButton` places a discrete `ToggleButton` next to a widget,
(usually a `Label`). See the section on `ToggleButton` widgets for
more information about toggle/check buttons.

The important signal ( `ToggleButton::toggled` ) is also inherited from
`ToggleButton`.

Creates a new `CheckButton` with a `Label` to the right of it.
## `label`
the text for the check button.

# Returns

a `Widget`.
<!-- impl CheckButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `CheckButton` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the check button.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `CheckButton`
<!-- struct CheckMenuItem -->
A `CheckMenuItem` is a menu item that maintains the state of a boolean
value in addition to a `MenuItem` usual role in activating application
code.

A check box indicating the state of the boolean value is displayed
at the left side of the `MenuItem`. Activating the `MenuItem`
toggles the value.

<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `CheckMenuItem` with a label.
## `label`

# Returns

a new `CheckMenuItem`.
<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `CheckMenuItem` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the menu item.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 character

# Returns

<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn get_inconsistent -->
Retrieves the value set by `CheckMenuItem::set_inconsistent`.

# Returns

`true` if inconsistent
<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn set_active -->
Sets the active state of the menu item’s check box.
## `is_active`
boolean value indicating whether the check box is active.
<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn set_draw_as_radio -->
Sets whether `self` is drawn like a `RadioMenuItem`
## `draw_as_radio`
whether `self` is drawn like a `RadioMenuItem`
<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn set_inconsistent -->
If the user has selected a range of elements (such as some text or
spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a boolean setting, and the
current values in that range are inconsistent, you may want to
display the check in an “in between” state. This function turns on
“in between” display. Normally you would turn off the inconsistent
state again if the user explicitly selects a setting. This has to be
done manually, `CheckMenuItem::set_inconsistent` only affects
visual appearance, it doesn’t affect the semantics of the widget.
## `setting`
`true` to display an “inconsistent” third state check
<!-- impl CheckMenuItem::fn toggled -->
Emits the `CheckMenuItem::toggled` signal.
<!-- struct Clipboard -->
The `Clipboard` object represents a clipboard of data shared
between different processes or between different widgets in
the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
`gdk::Atom`. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
`gdk::Atom_::intern` and `gdk::Atom_::name`.) The default clipboard
corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard
is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
the currently selected text.

To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
callbacks instead of the actual data. When you set the contents
of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
functions like `Clipboard::set_text`), or you can supply a
callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
`Clipboard::set_with_data` or `Clipboard::set_with_owner`.)
Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
when it is not needed.

`Clipboard::set_with_data` and `Clipboard::set_with_owner`
are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
which is more convenient in a particular situation.
The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
advertise. When the `clear_func` you provided is called, you
simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a `gobject::Object`
(As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
provides the clipboard’s contents the contents are simply the
text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
entry widget can call `Clipboard::set_with_owner` to update
the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
about `clear_func` being called.

Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
to request the selection, `Clipboard::request_contents` takes a
callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
when the request fails.) If you don’t want to deal with providing
a separate callback, you can also use `Clipboard::wait_for_contents`.
What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
while this recursive mainloop is running.

Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
it as text, `Clipboard::request_text` and
`Clipboard::wait_for_text`. These functions take care of
determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
form for representing strings in GTK+.)

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn get -->
Returns the clipboard object for the given selection.
See `Clipboard::get_for_display` for complete details.
## `selection`
a `gdk::Atom` which identifies the clipboard to use

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object. If no clipboard
 already exists, a new one will be created. Once a clipboard
 object has been created, it is persistent and, since it is
 owned by GTK+, must not be freed or unreffed.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn get_default -->
Returns the default clipboard object for use with cut/copy/paste menu items
and keyboard shortcuts.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `display`
the `gdk::Display` for which the clipboard is to be retrieved.

# Returns

the default clipboard object.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn get_for_display -->
Returns the clipboard object for the given selection.
Cut/copy/paste menu items and keyboard shortcuts should use
the default clipboard, returned by passing `GDK_SELECTION_CLIPBOARD` for `selection`.
(`GDK_NONE` is supported as a synonym for GDK_SELECTION_CLIPBOARD
for backwards compatibility reasons.)
The currently-selected object or text should be provided on the clipboard
identified by `GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY`. Cut/copy/paste menu items
conceptually copy the contents of the `GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY` clipboard
to the default clipboard, i.e. they copy the selection to what the
user sees as the clipboard.

(Passing `GDK_NONE` is the same as using `gdk_atom_intern
("CLIPBOARD", FALSE)`.

See the
[FreeDesktop Clipboard Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/clipboards-spec)
for a detailed discussion of the “CLIPBOARD” vs. “PRIMARY”
selections under the X window system. On Win32 the
`GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY` clipboard is essentially ignored.)

It’s possible to have arbitrary named clipboards; if you do invent
new clipboards, you should prefix the selection name with an
underscore (because the ICCCM requires that nonstandard atoms are
underscore-prefixed), and namespace it as well. For example,
if your application called “Foo” has a special-purpose
clipboard, you might call it “_FOO_SPECIAL_CLIPBOARD”.
## `display`
the `gdk::Display` for which the clipboard is to be retrieved or created.
## `selection`
a `gdk::Atom` which identifies the clipboard to use.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object. If no
 clipboard already exists, a new one will be created. Once a clipboard
 object has been created, it is persistent and, since it is owned by
 GTK+, must not be freed or unrefd.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn clear -->
Clears the contents of the clipboard. Generally this should only
be called between the time you call `Clipboard::set_with_owner`
or `Clipboard::set_with_data`,
and when the `clear_func` you supplied is called. Otherwise, the
clipboard may be owned by someone else.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn get_display -->
Gets the `gdk::Display` associated with `self`

# Returns

the `gdk::Display` associated with `self`
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn get_owner -->
If the clipboard contents callbacks were set with
`Clipboard::set_with_owner`, and the `Clipboard::set_with_data` or
`Clipboard::clear` has not subsequently called, returns the owner set
by `Clipboard::set_with_owner`.

# Returns

the owner of the clipboard, if any;
 otherwise `None`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_contents -->
Requests the contents of clipboard as the given target.
When the results of the result are later received the supplied callback
will be called.
## `target`
an atom representing the form into which the clipboard
 owner should convert the selection.
## `callback`
A function to call when the results are received
 (or the retrieval fails). If the retrieval fails the length field of
 `selection_data` will be negative.
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_image -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as image. When the image is
later received, it will be converted to a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, and
`callback` will be called.

The `pixbuf` parameter to `callback` will contain the resulting
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` if the request succeeded, or `None` if it failed. This
could happen for various reasons, in particular if the clipboard
was empty or if the contents of the clipboard could not be
converted into an image.
## `callback`
a function to call when the image is received,
 or the retrieval fails. (It will always be called one way or the other.)
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_rich_text -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as rich text. When the rich
text is later received, `callback` will be called.

The `text` parameter to `callback` will contain the resulting rich
text if the request succeeded, or `None` if it failed. The `length`
parameter will contain `text`’s length. This function can fail for
various reasons, in particular if the clipboard was empty or if the
contents of the clipboard could not be converted into rich text form.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`
## `callback`
a function to call when the text is received,
 or the retrieval fails. (It will always be called one way or the other.)
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_targets -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as list of supported targets.
When the list is later received, `callback` will be called.

The `targets` parameter to `callback` will contain the resulting targets if
the request succeeded, or `None` if it failed.
## `callback`
a function to call when the targets are
 received, or the retrieval fails. (It will always be called
 one way or the other.)
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_text -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as text. When the text is
later received, it will be converted to UTF-8 if necessary, and
`callback` will be called.

The `text` parameter to `callback` will contain the resulting text if
the request succeeded, or `None` if it failed. This could happen for
various reasons, in particular if the clipboard was empty or if the
contents of the clipboard could not be converted into text form.
## `callback`
a function to call when the text is received,
 or the retrieval fails. (It will always be called one way or the other.)
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn request_uris -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as URIs. When the URIs are
later received `callback` will be called.

The `uris` parameter to `callback` will contain the resulting array of
URIs if the request succeeded, or `None` if it failed. This could happen
for various reasons, in particular if the clipboard was empty or if the
contents of the clipboard could not be converted into URI form.
## `callback`
a function to call when the URIs are received,
 or the retrieval fails. (It will always be called one way or the other.)
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `callback`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn set_can_store -->
Hints that the clipboard data should be stored somewhere when the
application exits or when gtk_clipboard_store () is called.

This value is reset when the clipboard owner changes.
Where the clipboard data is stored is platform dependent,
see gdk_display_store_clipboard () for more information.
## `targets`
array containing
 information about which forms should be stored or `None`
 to indicate that all forms should be stored.
## `n_targets`
number of elements in `targets`
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn set_image -->
Sets the contents of the clipboard to the given `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`.
GTK+ will take responsibility for responding for requests
for the image, and for converting the image into the
requested format.
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn set_text -->
Sets the contents of the clipboard to the given UTF-8 string. GTK+ will
make a copy of the text and take responsibility for responding
for requests for the text, and for converting the text into
the requested format.
## `text`
a UTF-8 string.
## `len`
length of `text`, in bytes, or -1, in which case
 the length will be determined with `strlen`.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn set_with_data -->
Virtually sets the contents of the specified clipboard by providing
a list of supported formats for the clipboard data and a function
to call to get the actual data when it is requested.
## `targets`
array containing information
 about the available forms for the clipboard data
## `n_targets`
number of elements in `targets`
## `get_func`
function to call to get the actual clipboard data
## `clear_func`
when the clipboard contents are set again,
 this function will be called, and `get_func` will not be subsequently
 called.
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `get_func` and `clear_func`.

# Returns

`true` if setting the clipboard data succeeded.
 If setting the clipboard data failed the provided callback
 functions will be ignored.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn set_with_owner -->
Virtually sets the contents of the specified clipboard by providing
a list of supported formats for the clipboard data and a function
to call to get the actual data when it is requested.

The difference between this function and `Clipboard::set_with_data`
is that instead of an generic `user_data` pointer, a `gobject::Object` is passed
in.
## `targets`
array containing information
 about the available forms for the clipboard data
## `n_targets`
number of elements in `targets`
## `get_func`
function to call to get the actual clipboard data
## `clear_func`
when the clipboard contents are set again,
 this function will be called, and `get_func` will not be subsequently
 called
## `owner`
an object that “owns” the data. This object will be passed
 to the callbacks when called

# Returns

`true` if setting the clipboard data succeeded.
 If setting the clipboard data failed the provided callback
 functions will be ignored.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn store -->
Stores the current clipboard data somewhere so that it will stay
around after the application has quit.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn wait_for_contents -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard using the given target.
This function waits for the data to be received using the main
loop, so events, timeouts, etc, may be dispatched during the wait.
## `target`
an atom representing the form into which the clipboard
 owner should convert the selection.

# Returns

a newly-allocated `SelectionData` object or `None`
 if retrieving the given target failed. If non-`None`,
 this value must be freed with `SelectionData::free`
 when you are finished with it.
<!-- impl Clipboard::fn wait_for_image -->
Requests the contents of the clipboard as image and converts
the result to a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`. This function waits for
the data to be received using the main loop, so events,
timeouts, etc, may be dispatched during the wait.

# Returns

<!-- struct ColorChooser -->
`ColorChooser` is an interface that is implemented by widgets
for choosing colors. Depending on the situation, colors may be
allowed to have alpha (translucency).

In GTK+, the main widgets that implement this interface are
`ColorChooserWidget`, `ColorChooserDialog` and `ColorButton`.

# Implements

<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn add_palette -->
Adds a palette to the color chooser. If `orientation` is horizontal,
the colors are grouped in rows, with `colors_per_line` colors
in each row. If `horizontal` is `false`, the colors are grouped
in columns instead.

The default color palette of `ColorChooserWidget` has
27 colors, organized in columns of 3 colors. The default gray
palette has 9 grays in a single row.

The layout of the color chooser widget works best when the
palettes have 9-10 columns.

Calling this function for the first time has the
side effect of removing the default color and gray palettes
from the color chooser.

If `colors` is `None`, removes all previously added palettes.
## `orientation`
`Orientation::Horizontal` if the palette should
 be displayed in rows, `Orientation::Vertical` for columns
## `colors_per_line`

## `colors`
the colors of the palette, or `None`
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_rgba -->
Gets the currently-selected color.
## `color`
a `gdk::RGBA` to fill in with the current color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_use_alpha -->
Returns whether the color chooser shows the alpha channel.

# Returns

`true` if the color chooser uses the alpha channel,
 `false` if not
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_rgba -->
Sets the color.
## `color`
the new color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_use_alpha -->
Sets whether or not the color chooser should use the alpha channel.
## `use_alpha`
`true` if color chooser should use alpha channel, `false` if not
<!-- struct ColorChooserDialog -->
The `ColorChooserDialog` widget is a dialog for choosing
a color. It implements the `ColorChooser` interface.

<!-- impl ColorChooserDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new `ColorChooserDialog`.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`

# Returns

a new `ColorChooserDialog`
<!-- struct ColorChooserWidget -->
The `ColorChooserWidget` widget lets the user select a
color. By default, the chooser presents a predefined palette
of colors, plus a small number of settable custom colors.
It is also possible to select a different color with the
single-color editor. To enter the single-color editing mode,
use the context menu of any color of the palette, or use the
'+' button to add a new custom color.

The chooser automatically remembers the last selection, as well
as custom colors.

To change the initially selected color, use `ColorChooser::set_rgba`.
To get the selected color use `ColorChooser::get_rgba`.

The `ColorChooserWidget` is used in the `ColorChooserDialog`
to provide a dialog for selecting colors.

<!-- struct ComboBox -->
A `ComboBox` is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
valid choices. The `ComboBox` displays the selected choice. When
activated, the `ComboBox` displays a popup which allows the user to
make a new choice. The style in which the selected value is displayed,
and the style of the popup is determined by the current theme. It may
be similar to a Windows-style combo box.

The `ComboBox` uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
would in a tree view. This is possible since `ComboBox` implements the
`CellLayout` interface. The tree model holding the valid choices is
not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the popup will
reflect the tree structure.

To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the “has-entry”
property allows the `ComboBox` to contain a `Entry`. This entry
can be accessed by calling `BinExt::get_child` on the combo box.

For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of `ComboBox`
can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, `ComboBoxText` offers a
simple alternative. Both `ComboBox` and `ComboBoxText` can contain
an entry.

<!-- struct ComboBoxText -->
A `ComboBoxText` is a simple variant of `ComboBox` that hides
the model-view complexity for simple text-only use cases.

To create a `ComboBoxText`, use `ComboBoxText::new` or
`ComboBoxText::new_with_entry`.

You can add items to a `ComboBoxText` with
`ComboBoxText::append_text`, `ComboBoxText::insert_text`
or `ComboBoxText::prepend_text` and remove options with
`ComboBoxText::remove`.

If the `ComboBoxText` contains an entry (via the “has-entry” property),
its contents can be retrieved using `ComboBoxText::get_active_text`.
The entry itself can be accessed by calling `BinExt::get_child` on the
combo box.

You should not call `ComboBoxExt::set_model` or attempt to pack more cells
into this combo box via its `CellLayout` interface.

# `ComboBoxText` as `Buildable`

The `ComboBoxText` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding items directly using the `<items>` element and specifying `<item>`
elements for each item. Each `<item>` element can specify the “id”
corresponding to the appended text and also supports the regular
translation attributes “translatable”, “context” and “comments”.

Here is a UI definition fragment specifying `ComboBoxText` items:

```text
<object class="GtkComboBoxText">
  <items>
    <item translatable="yes" id="factory">Factory</item>
    <item translatable="yes" id="home">Home</item>
    <item translatable="yes" id="subway">Subway</item>
  </items>
</object>

This is the same as calling `ComboBoxText::insert` with a
position of 0.
## `id`
a string ID for this value, or `None`
## `text`
a string
<!-- impl ComboBoxText::fn prepend_text -->
Prepends `text` to the list of strings stored in `self`.

This is the same as calling `ComboBoxText::insert_text` with a
position of 0.
## `text`
A string
<!-- impl ComboBoxText::fn remove -->
Removes the string at `position` from `self`.
## `position`
Index of the item to remove
<!-- impl ComboBoxText::fn remove_all -->
Removes all the text entries from the combo box.
<!-- struct Container -->
A GTK+ user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets.
Container widgets are the inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets:
they contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a `Window`
containing a `Frame` containing a `Label`. If you wanted an image instead
of a textual label inside the frame, you might replace the `Label` widget
with a `Image` widget.

There are two major kinds of container widgets in GTK+. Both are subclasses
of the abstract `Container` base class.

The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives
from `Bin`. These containers are decorators, which
add some kind of functionality to the child. For example, a `Button` makes
its child into a clickable button; a `Frame` draws a frame around its child
and a `Window` places its child widget inside a top-level window.

The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is to
manage layout. This means that these containers assign
sizes and positions to their children. For example, a `HBox` arranges its
children in a horizontal row, and a `Grid` arranges the widgets it contains
in a two-dimensional grid.

# Height for width geometry management

GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management system.
Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much vertical space it needs,
depending on the amount of horizontal space that it is given (and similar for
width-for-height).

There are some things to keep in mind when implementing container widgets
that make use of GTK+’s height for width geometry management system. First,
it’s important to note that a container must prioritize one of its
dimensions, that is to say that a widget or container can only have a
`SizeRequestMode` that is `SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` or
`SizeRequestMode::WidthForHeight`. However, every widget and container
must be able to respond to the APIs for both dimensions, i.e. even if a
widget has a request mode that is height-for-width, it is possible that
its parent will request its sizes using the width-for-height APIs.

To ensure that everything works properly, here are some guidelines to follow
when implementing height-for-width (or width-for-height) containers.

Each request mode involves 2 virtual methods. Height-for-width apis run
through `Widget::get_preferred_width` and then through `Widget::get_preferred_height_for_width`.
When handling requests in the opposite `SizeRequestMode` it is important that
every widget request at least enough space to display all of its content at all times.

When `Widget::get_preferred_height` is called on a container that is height-for-width,
the container must return the height for its minimum width. This is easily achieved by
simply calling the reverse apis implemented for itself as follows:


```C
static void
foo_container_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
                                    gint *min_height,
                                    gint *nat_height)
{
   if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
     {
       gint min_width;

       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
                                                           &min_width,
                                                           NULL);
       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
                                                          (widget,
                                                           min_width,
                                                           min_height,
                                                           nat_height);
     }
   else
     {
       ... many containers support both request modes, execute the
       real width-for-height request here by returning the
       collective heights of all widgets that are stacked
       vertically (or whatever is appropriate for this container)
       ...
     }
}
```

Similarly, when `Widget::get_preferred_width_for_height` is called for a container or widget
that is height-for-width, it then only needs to return the base minimum width like so:


```C
static void
foo_container_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
                                              gint for_height,
                                              gint *min_width,
                                              gint *nat_width)
{
   if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
     {
       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
                                                           min_width,
                                                           nat_width);
     }
   else
     {
       ... execute the real width-for-height request here based on
       the required width of the children collectively if the
       container were to be allocated the said height ...
     }
}
```

Height for width requests are generally implemented in terms of a virtual allocation
of widgets in the input orientation. Assuming an height-for-width request mode, a container
would implement the `get_preferred_height_for_width` virtual function by first calling
`Widget::get_preferred_width` for each of its children.

For each potential group of children that are lined up horizontally, the values returned by
`Widget::get_preferred_width` should be collected in an array of `RequestedSize` structures.
Any child spacing should be removed from the input `for_width` and then the collective size should be
allocated using the `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation` convenience function.

The container will then move on to request the preferred height for each child by using
`Widget::get_preferred_height_for_width` and using the sizes stored in the `RequestedSize` array.

To allocate a height-for-width container, it’s again important
to consider that a container must prioritize one dimension over the other. So if
a container is a height-for-width container it must first allocate all widgets horizontally
using a `RequestedSize` array and `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation` and then add any
extra space (if and where appropriate) for the widget to expand.

After adding all the expand space, the container assumes it was allocated sufficient
height to fit all of its content. At this time, the container must use the total horizontal sizes
of each widget to request the height-for-width of each of its children and store the requests in a
`RequestedSize` array for any widgets that stack vertically (for tabular containers this can
be generalized into the heights and widths of rows and columns).
The vertical space must then again be distributed using `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation`
while this time considering the allocated height of the widget minus any vertical spacing
that the container adds. Then vertical expand space should be added where appropriate and available
and the container should go on to actually allocating the child widgets.

See [`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management]
to learn more about implementing height-for-width geometry management for widgets.

# Child properties

`Container` introduces child properties.
These are object properties that are not specific
to either the container or the contained widget, but rather to their relation.
Typical examples of child properties are the position or pack-type of a widget
which is contained in a `Box`.

Use `ContainerClass::install_child_property` to install child properties
for a container class and `ContainerClass::find_child_property` or
`ContainerClass::list_child_properties` to get information about existing
child properties.

To set the value of a child property, use `Container::child_set_property`,
`ContainerExt::child_set` or `ContainerExt::child_set_valist`.
To obtain the value of a child property, use
`Container::child_get_property`, `ContainerExt::child_get` or
`ContainerExt::child_get_valist`. To emit notification about child property
changes, use `Widget::child_notify`.

# `Container` as `Buildable`

The `Container` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
a `<packing>` element for children, which can contain multiple `<property>`
elements that specify child properties for the child.

Since 2.16, child properties can also be marked as translatable using
the same “translatable”, “comments” and “context” attributes that are used
for regular properties.

Since 3.16, containers can have a `<focus-chain>` element containing multiple
`<widget>` elements, one for each child that should be added to the focus
chain. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

An example of these properties in UI definitions:

```text
<object class="GtkBox">
  <child>
    <object class="GtkEntry" id="entry1"/>
    <packing>
      <property name="pack-type">start</property>
    </packing>
  </child>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkEntry" id="entry2"/>
  </child>
  <focus-chain>
    <widget name="entry1"/>
    <widget name="entry2"/>
  </focus-chain>
</object>
```

<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn add -->
Adds `widget` to `self`. Typically used for simple containers
such as `Window`, `Frame`, or `Button`; for more complicated
layout containers such as `Box` or `Grid`, this function will
pick default packing parameters that may not be correct. So
consider functions such as `BoxExt::pack_start` and
`Grid::attach` as an alternative to `ContainerExt::add` in
those cases. A widget may be added to only one container at a time;
you can’t place the same widget inside two different containers.

Note that some containers, such as `ScrolledWindow` or `ListBox`,
may add intermediate children between the added widget and the
container.
## `widget`
a widget to be placed inside `self`

<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn child_notify -->
Emits a `Widget::child-notify` signal for the
[child property][child-properties]
`child_property` on widget.

This is an analogue of `gobject::Object::notify` for child properties.

<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn child_type -->
Returns the type of the children supported by the container.

Note that this may return `G_TYPE_NONE` to indicate that no more
children can be added, e.g. for a `Paned` which already has two
children.

# Returns

a `glib::Type`.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn forall -->
Invokes `callback` on each child of `self`, including children
that are considered “internal” (implementation details of the
container). “Internal” children generally weren’t added by the user
of the container, but were added by the container implementation
itself. Most applications should use `ContainerExt::foreach`,
rather than `ContainerExt::forall`.
## `callback`
a callback
## `callback_data`
callback user data
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn foreach -->
Invokes `callback` on each non-internal child of `self`. See
`ContainerExt::forall` for details on what constitutes an
“internal” child. Most applications should use
`ContainerExt::foreach`, rather than `ContainerExt::forall`.
## `callback`
a callback
## `callback_data`
callback user data
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_border_width -->
Retrieves the border width of the container. See
`ContainerExt::set_border_width`.

# Returns

the current border width
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_children -->
Returns the container’s non-internal children. See
`ContainerExt::forall` for details on what constitutes an "internal" child.

# Returns

a newly-allocated list of the container’s non-internal children.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_chain -->
Retrieves the focus chain of the container, if one has been
set explicitly. If no focus chain has been explicitly
set, GTK+ computes the focus chain based on the positions
of the children. In that case, GTK+ stores `None` in
`focusable_widgets` and returns `false`.
## `focusable_widgets`
location
 to store the focus chain of the
 container, or `None`. You should free this list
 using `glib::List::free` when you are done with it, however
 no additional reference count is added to the
 individual widgets in the focus chain.

# Returns

`true` if the focus chain of the container
has been set explicitly.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_child -->
Returns the current focus child widget inside `self`. This is not the
currently focused widget. That can be obtained by calling
`Window::get_focus`.

# Returns

The child widget which will receive the
 focus inside `self` when the `conatiner` is focussed,
 or `None` if none is set.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_hadjustment -->
Retrieves the horizontal focus adjustment for the container. See
gtk_container_set_focus_hadjustment ().

# Returns

the horizontal focus adjustment, or `None` if
 none has been set.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_vadjustment -->
Retrieves the vertical focus adjustment for the container. See
`ContainerExt::set_focus_vadjustment`.

# Returns

the vertical focus adjustment, or `None` if
 none has been set.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_path_for_child -->
Returns a newly created widget path representing all the widget hierarchy
from the toplevel down to and including `child`.
## `child`
a child of `self`

# Returns

A newly created `WidgetPath`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_resize_mode -->
Returns the resize mode for the container. See
gtk_container_set_resize_mode ().

# Deprecated since 3.12

Resize modes are deprecated. They aren’t necessary
 anymore since frame clocks and might introduce obscure bugs if
 used.

# Returns

the current resize mode
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn propagate_draw -->
When a container receives a call to the draw function, it must send
synthetic `Widget::draw` calls to all children that don’t have their
own ``GdkWindows``. This function provides a convenient way of doing this.
A container, when it receives a call to its `Widget::draw` function,
calls `ContainerExt::propagate_draw` once for each child, passing in
the `cr` the container received.

`ContainerExt::propagate_draw` takes care of translating the origin of `cr`,
and deciding whether the draw needs to be sent to the child. It is a
convenient and optimized way of getting the same effect as calling
`Widget::draw` on the child directly.

In most cases, a container can simply either inherit the
`Widget::draw` implementation from `Container`, or do some drawing
and then chain to the ::draw implementation from `Container`.
## `child`
a child of `self`
## `cr`
Cairo context as passed to the container. If you want to use `cr`
 in container’s draw function, consider using `cairo_save` and
 `cairo_restore` before calling this function.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn remove -->
Removes `widget` from `self`. `widget` must be inside `self`.
Note that `self` will own a reference to `widget`, and that this
may be the last reference held; so removing a widget from its
container can destroy that widget. If you want to use `widget`
again, you need to add a reference to it while it’s not inside
a container, using `gobject::Object::ref`. If you don’t want to use `widget`
again it’s usually more efficient to simply destroy it directly
using `Widget::destroy` since this will remove it from the
container and help break any circular reference count cycles.
## `widget`
a current child of `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn resize_children -->

# Deprecated since 3.10

<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_border_width -->
Sets the border width of the container.

The border width of a container is the amount of space to leave
around the outside of the container. The only exception to this is
`Window`; because toplevel windows can’t leave space outside,
they leave the space inside. The border is added on all sides of
the container. To add space to only one side, use a specific
`Widget:margin` property on the child widget, for example
`Widget:margin-top`.
## `border_width`
amount of blank space to leave outside
 the container. Valid values are in the range 0-65535 pixels.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_chain -->
Sets a focus chain, overriding the one computed automatically by GTK+.

In principle each widget in the chain should be a descendant of the
container, but this is not enforced by this method, since it’s allowed
to set the focus chain before you pack the widgets, or have a widget
in the chain that isn’t always packed. The necessary checks are done
when the focus chain is actually traversed.
## `focusable_widgets`

 the new focus chain
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_child -->
Sets, or unsets if `child` is `None`, the focused child of `self`.

This function emits the `Container`::set_focus_child signal of
`self`. Implementations of `Container` can override the
default behaviour by overriding the class closure of this signal.

This is function is mostly meant to be used by widgets. Applications can use
`Widget::grab_focus` to manually set the focus to a specific widget.
## `child`
a `Widget`, or `None`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_hadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in a container, so when a child
of the container is focused, the adjustment is scrolled to show that
widget. This function sets the horizontal alignment.
See `ScrolledWindow::get_hadjustment` for a typical way of obtaining
the adjustment and `ContainerExt::set_focus_vadjustment` for setting
the vertical adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same coordinate
system as the allocation for immediate children of the container.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted when the focus is
 moved among the descendents of `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_vadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in a container, so when a
child of the container is focused, the adjustment is scrolled to
show that widget. This function sets the vertical alignment. See
`ScrolledWindow::get_vadjustment` for a typical way of obtaining
the adjustment and `ContainerExt::set_focus_hadjustment` for setting
the horizontal adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same coordinate
system as the allocation for immediate children of the container.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted when the focus
 is moved among the descendents of `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_reallocate_redraws -->
Sets the `reallocate_redraws` flag of the container to the given value.

Containers requesting reallocation redraws get automatically
redrawn if any of their children changed allocation.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Call `Widget::queue_draw` in your size_allocate handler.
## `needs_redraws`
the new value for the container’s `reallocate_redraws` flag
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_resize_mode -->
Sets the resize mode for the container.

The resize mode of a container determines whether a resize request
will be passed to the container’s parent, queued for later execution
or executed immediately.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Resize modes are deprecated. They aren’t necessary
 anymore since frame clocks and might introduce obscure bugs if
 used.
## `resize_mode`
the new resize mode
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn unset_focus_chain -->
Removes a focus chain explicitly set with `ContainerExt::set_focus_chain`.
<!-- enum CornerType -->
Specifies which corner a child widget should be placed in when packed into
a `ScrolledWindow`. This is effectively the opposite of where the scroll
bars are placed.
<!-- enum CornerType::variant TopLeft -->
Place the scrollbars on the right and bottom of the
 widget (default behaviour).
<!-- enum CornerType::variant BottomLeft -->
Place the scrollbars on the top and right of the
 widget.
<!-- enum CornerType::variant TopRight -->
Place the scrollbars on the left and bottom of the
 widget.
<!-- enum CornerType::variant BottomRight -->
Place the scrollbars on the top and left of the
 widget.
<!-- struct CssProvider -->
`CssProvider` is an object implementing the `StyleProvider` interface.
It is able to parse [CSS-like](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2)
input in order to style widgets.

## Default files

An application can cause GTK+ to parse a specific CSS style sheet by
calling `CssProvider::load_from_file` and adding the provider with
`StyleContext::add_provider` or `StyleContext::add_provider_for_screen`.
In addition, certain files will be read when GTK+ is initialized. First,
the file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`
is loaded if it exists. Then, GTK+ tries to load
`$HOME/.themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`,
falling back to
`datadir/share/themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`,
where theme-name is the name of the current theme
(see the `Settings:gtk-theme-name` setting) and datadir
is the prefix configured when GTK+ was compiled, unless overridden by the
`GTK_DATA_PREFIX` environment variable.

# Style sheets

The basic structure of the style sheets understood by this provider is
a series of statements, which are either rule sets or “@-rules”, separated
by whitespace.

A rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block, which is
a series of declarations enclosed in curly braces ({ and }). The
declarations are separated by semicolons (;). Multiple selectors can
share the same declaration block, by putting all the separators in
front of the block, separated by commas.

An example of a rule set with two selectors:

```text
GtkButton, GtkEntry {
    color: #ff00ea;
    font: Comic Sans 12
}
```

# Selectors # {`gtkcssprovider`-selectors}

Selectors work very similar to the way they do in CSS, with widget class
names taking the role of element names, and widget names taking the role
of IDs. When used in a selector, widget names must be prefixed with a
'#' character. The “*” character represents the so-called universal
selector, which matches any widget.

To express more complicated situations, selectors can be combined in
various ways:
- To require that a widget satisfies several conditions,
 combine several selectors into one by concatenating them. E.g.
 `GtkButton#button1` matches a `Button` widget
 with the name button1.
- To only match a widget when it occurs inside some other
 widget, write the two selectors after each other, separated by whitespace.
 E.g. `GtkToolBar GtkButton` matches `Button` widgets
 that occur inside a `GtkToolBar`.
- In the previous example, the `Button` is matched even
 if it occurs deeply nested inside the toolbar. To restrict the match
 to direct children of the parent widget, insert a “>” character between
 the two selectors. E.g. `GtkNotebook > GtkLabel` matches
 `Label` widgets that are direct children of a `Notebook`.

## Examples of widget classes and names in selectors

Theme labels that are descendants of a window:

```text
GtkWindow GtkLabel {
    background-color: #898989
}
```

Theme notebooks, and anything that’s within these:

```text
GtkNotebook {
    background-color: #a939f0
}
```

Theme combo boxes, and entries that are direct children of a notebook:

```text
GtkComboBox,
GtkNotebook > GtkEntry {
    color: @fg_color;
    background-color: #1209a2
}
```

Theme any widget within a `Bin`:

```text
GtkBin * {
    font: Sans 20
}
```

Theme a label named title-label:

```text
GtkLabel#title-label {
    font: Sans 15
}
```

Theme any widget named main-entry:

```text
#main-entry {
    background-color: #f0a810
}
```

Widgets may also define style classes, which can be used for matching.
When used in a selector, style classes must be prefixed with a “.”
character.

Refer to the documentation of individual widgets to learn which
style classes they define and see
[Style Classes and Regions][gtkstylecontext-classes]
for a list of all style classes used by GTK+ widgets.

Note that there is some ambiguity in the selector syntax when it comes
to differentiation widget class names from regions. GTK+ currently treats
a string as a widget class name if it contains any uppercase characters
(which should work for more widgets with names like `Label`).

## Examples for style classes in selectors

Theme all widgets defining the class entry:

```text
.entry {
    color: #39f1f9;
}
```

Theme spinbuttons’ entry:

```text
GtkSpinButton.entry {
    color: #900185
}
```

In complicated widgets like e.g. a `Notebook`, it may be desirable
to style different parts of the widget differently. To make this
possible, container widgets may define regions, whose names
may be used for matching in selectors.

Some containers allow to further differentiate between regions by
applying so-called pseudo-classes to the region. For example, the
tab region in `Notebook` allows to single out the first or last
tab by using the :first-child or :last-child pseudo-class.
When used in selectors, pseudo-classes must be prefixed with a
':' character.

Refer to the documentation of individual widgets to learn which
regions and pseudo-classes they define and see
[Style Classes and Regions][gtkstylecontext-classes]
for a list of all regions
used by GTK+ widgets.

## Examples for regions in selectors

Theme any label within a notebook:

```text
GtkNotebook GtkLabel {
    color: #f90192;
}
```

Theme labels within notebook tabs:

```text
GtkNotebook tab GtkLabel {
    color: #703910;
}
```

Theme labels in the any first notebook tab, both selectors are
equivalent:

```text
GtkNotebook tab:nth-child(first) GtkLabel,
GtkNotebook tab:first-child GtkLabel {
    color: #89d012;
}
```

Another use of pseudo-classes is to match widgets depending on their
state. This is conceptually similar to the :hover, :active or :focus
pseudo-classes in CSS. The available pseudo-classes for widget states
are :active, :prelight (or :hover), :insensitive, :selected, :focused
and :inconsistent.

## Examples for styling specific widget states

Theme active (pressed) buttons:

```text
GtkButton:active {
    background-color: #0274d9;
}
```

Theme buttons with the mouse pointer on it, both are equivalent:

```text
GtkButton:hover,
GtkButton:prelight {
    background-color: #3085a9;
}
```

Theme insensitive widgets, both are equivalent:

```text
:insensitive,
*:insensitive {
    background-color: #320a91;
}
```

Theme selection colors in entries:

```text
GtkEntry:selected {
    background-color: #56f9a0;
}
```

Theme focused labels:

```text
GtkLabel:focused {
    background-color: #b4940f;
}
```

Theme inconsistent checkbuttons:

```text
GtkCheckButton:inconsistent {
    background-color: #20395a;
}
```

Widget state pseudoclasses may only apply to the last element
in a selector.

To determine the effective style for a widget, all the matching rule
sets are merged. As in CSS, rules apply by specificity, so the rules
whose selectors more closely match a widget path will take precedence
over the others.

# @ Rules

GTK+’s CSS supports the \@import rule, in order to load another
CSS style sheet in addition to the currently parsed one.

An example for using the \@import rule:

```text
@import url ("path/to/common.css");
```

In order to extend key bindings affecting different widgets, GTK+
supports the \@binding-set rule to parse a set of bind/unbind
directives, see `BindingSet` for the supported syntax. Note that
the binding sets defined in this way must be associated with rule sets
by setting the gtk-key-bindings style property.

Customized key bindings are typically defined in a separate
`gtk-keys.css` CSS file and GTK+ loads this file
according to the current key theme, which is defined by the
`Settings:gtk-key-theme-name` setting.

An example for using the \@binding rule:

```text
@binding-set binding-set1 {
  bind "<alt>Left" { "move-cursor" (visual-positions, -3, 0) };
  unbind "End";
};

@binding-set binding-set2 {
  bind "<alt>Right" { "move-cursor" (visual-positions, 3, 0) };
  bind "<alt>KP_space" { "delete-from-cursor" (whitespace, 1)
                         "insert-at-cursor" (" ") };
};

GtkEntry {
  gtk-key-bindings: binding-set1, binding-set2;
}
```

GTK+ also supports an additional \@define-color rule, in order
to define a color name which may be used instead of color numeric
representations. Also see the `Settings:gtk-color-scheme` setting
for a way to override the values of these named colors.

An example for defining colors:

```text
@define-color bg_color #f9a039;

* {
    background-color: @bg_color;
}
```

# Symbolic colors

Besides being able to define color names, the CSS parser is also able
to read different color expressions, which can also be nested, providing
a rich language to define colors which are derived from a set of base
colors.

An example for using symbolic colors:

```text
@define-color entry-color shade (@bg_color, 0.7);

GtkEntry {
    background-color: @entry-color;
}

GtkEntry:focused {
    background-color: mix (@entry-color,
                           shade (#fff, 0.5),
                           0.8);
}
```

# Specifying Colors # {`specifying`-colors}
There are various ways to express colors in GTK+ CSS.

## rgb(r, g, b)

An opaque color.

- `r`, `g`, `b` can be either integers between 0 and 255, or percentages.


```text
  color: rgb(128, 10, 54);
  background-color: rgb(20%, 30%, 0%);
```

## rgba(r, g, b, a)

A translucent color.

- `r`, `g`, `b` can be either integers between 0 and 255, or percentages.
- `a` is a floating point number between 0 and 1.


```text
  color: rgb(128, 10, 54, 0.5);
```

## \#xxyyzz

An opaque color.

- `xx`, `yy`, `zz` are hexadecimal numbers specifying `r`, `g`, `b`
 variants with between 1 and 4 hexadecimal digits per component.


```text
  color: #f0c;
  background-color: #ff00cc;
  border-color: #ffff0000cccc;
```

## \@name

Reference to a color that has been defined with \@define-color


```text
  color: @bg_color;
```

## mix(color1, color2, factor)

A linear combination of `color1` and `color2`.

- `factor` is a floating point number between 0 and 1.


```text
  color: mix(#ff1e0a, @bg_color, 0.8);
```

## shade(color, factor)

A lighter or darker variant of `color`.

- `factor` is a floating point number.


```text
  color: shade(@fg_color, 0.5);
```

## lighter(color)

A lighter variant of `color`.


```text
  color: lighter(@fg_color);
```

## darker(color)

A darker variant of `color`.


```text
  color: darker(@bg_color);
```

## alpha(color, factor)

Modifies passed color’s alpha by a factor.

- `factor` is a floating point number. `factor` < 1.0 results in a more
 transparent color while `factor` > 1.0 results in a more opaque color.


```text
  color: alpha(@fg_color, 0.5);
```


# Gradients

Linear or radial gradients can be used as background images.

## Linear Gradients

A linear gradient along the line from (`start_x`, `start_y`) to
(`end_x`, `end_y`) is specified using the following syntax:

> `-gtk-gradient (linear, start_x start_y, end_x end_y, color-stop (position, color), ...)`

- `start_x` and `end_x` can be either a floating point number between
0 and 1, or one of the special values: “left”, “right”, or “center”.
- `start_y` and `end_y` can be either a floating point number between 0 and 1, or one
of the special values: “top”, “bottom” or “center”.
- `position` is a floating point number between 0 and 1.
- `color` is a color expression (see above).

The color-stop can be repeated multiple times to add more than one color
stop. “from (color)” and “to (color)” can be used as abbreviations for
color stops with position 0 and 1, respectively.

## Example: Linear Gradient
![](gradient1.png)

```text
-gtk-gradient (linear,
               left top, right bottom,
               from(@yellow), to(@blue));
```

## Example: Linear Gradient 2
![](gradient2.png)

```text
-gtk-gradient (linear,
               0 0, 0 1,
               color-stop(0, @yellow),
               color-stop(0.2, @blue),
               color-stop(1, #0f0))
```

## Radial Gradients

A radial gradient along the two circles defined by (`start_x`,
`start_y`, `start_radius`) and (`end_x`, `end_y`, `end_radius`) is
specified using the following syntax:

> `-gtk-gradient (radial, start_x start_y, start_radius, end_x end_y, end_radius, color-stop (position, color), ...)`

where `start_radius` and `end_radius` are floating point numbers
and the other parameters are as before.

## Example: Radial Gradient
![](gradient3.png)

```text
-gtk-gradient (radial,
               center center, 0,
               center center, 1,
               from(@yellow), to(@green))
```

## Example: Radial Gradient 2
![](gradient4.png)

```text
-gtk-gradient (radial,
               0.4 0.4, 0.1,
               0.6 0.6, 0.7,
               color-stop (0, #f00),
               color-stop (0.1, #a0f),
               color-stop (0.2, @yellow),
               color-stop (1, @green))
```

# Border images # {`border`-images}

Images and gradients can also be used in slices for the purpose of creating
scalable borders.
For more information, see the [CSS3 documentation for the border-image property](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/`border`-images).

![](slices.png)

The parameters of the slicing process are controlled by four
separate properties.

- Image Source
- Image Slice
- Image Width
- Image Repeat

Note that you can use the `border-image` shorthand property to set
values for the properties at the same time.

## Image Source

The border image source can be specified either as a
URL or a gradient:

```text
  border-image-source: url(path);
```
or

```text
  border-image-source: -gtk-gradient(...);
```

## Image Slice


```text
  border-image-slice: top right bottom left;
```

The sizes specified by the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` parameters
are the offsets (in pixels) from the relevant edge where the image
should be “cut off” to build the slices used for the rendering
of the border.

## Image Width


```text
  border-image-width: top right bottom left;
```

The sizes specified by the `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` parameters
are inward distances from the border box edge, used to specify the
rendered size of each slice determined by border-image-slice.
If this property is not specified, the values of border-width will
be used as a fallback.

## Image Repeat

Specifies how the image slices should be rendered in the area
outlined by border-width.


```text
  border-image-repeat: [stretch|repeat|round|space];
```
or

```text
  border-image-repeat: [stretch|repeat|round|space] [stretch|repeat|round|space];
```

- The default (stretch) is to resize the slice to fill in the
whole allocated area.

- If the value of this property is “repeat”, the image slice will
be tiled to fill the area.

- If the value of this property is “round”, the image slice will be
tiled to fill the area, and scaled to fit it exactly a whole number
of times.

- If the value of this property is “space”, the image slice will be
tiled to fill the area, and if it doesn’t fit it exactly a whole
number of times, the extra space is distributed as padding around
the slices.

- If two options are specified, the first one affects the
horizontal behaviour and the second one the vertical behaviour. If
only one option is specified, it affects both.


## Example: Border Image
![](border1.png)

```text
border-image: url("gradient1.png") 10 10 10 10;
```

## Example: Repeating Border Image
![](border2.png)

```text
border-image: url("gradient1.png") 10 10 10 10 repeat;
```

## Example: Stetched Border Image
![](border3.png)

```text
border-image: url("gradient1.png") 10 10 10 10 stretch;
```


# Supported Properties

Properties are the part that differ the most to common CSS, not all
properties are supported (some are planned to be supported
eventually, some others are meaningless or don't map intuitively in
a widget based environment).

The currently supported properties are:

## engine: [name|none];

- `none` means to use the default (ie. builtin engine)

```text
 engine: clearlooks;
```

## background-color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 background-color: shade (@color1, 0.5);
```

## color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 color: #fff;
```

## border-color: [color|transparent]{1,4};

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]
- Four values used to specify: top right bottom left
- Three values used to specify: top vertical bottom
- Two values used to specify: horizontal vertical
- One value used to specify: color

```text
 border-color: red green blue;
```

## border-top-color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 border-top-color: @borders;
```

## border-right-color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 border-right-color: @borders;
```

## border-bottom-color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 border-bottom-color: @borders;
```

## border-left-color: [color|transparent];

- `color`: See [Specifying Colors][specifying-colors]

```text
 border-left-color: @borders;
```

## font-family: name;

The name of the font family or font name to use.

- Note: unlike the CSS2 Specification this does not support using a
 prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family
 names.


```text
 font-family: Sans, Cantarell;
```

## font-style: [normal|oblique|italic];

Selects between normal, italic and oblique faces within a font family.


```text
 font-style: italic;
```

## font-variant: [normal|small-caps];

In a small-caps font the lower case letters look similar to the
uppercase ones, but in a smaller size and with slightly different
proportions.


```text
 font-variant: normal;
```

## font-weight: [normal|bold|bolder|lighter|100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900];

Selects the weight of the font. The values '100' to '900' form an
ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at
least as dark as its predecessor. The keyword 'normal' is
synonymous with '400', and 'bold' is synonymous with
'700'. Keywords other than 'normal' and 'bold' have been shown to
be often confused with font names and a numerical scale was
therefore chosen for the 9-value list.
- Maps to `PANGO_TYPE_WEIGHT`

```text
 font-weight: bold;
```

## font-size: [absolute-size|relative-size|percentage];

- `absolute-size`: The size in normal size units like `px`, `pt`,
 and `em`. Or symbolic sizes like `xx-small`, `x-small`, `small`,
 `medium`, `large`, `x-large`, `xx-large`.
- `relative-size`: `larger` or `smaller` relative to the parent.
- `percentage`: A percentage difference from the nominal size.

```text
 font-size: 12px;
```

## font-stretch: [face]

Selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font family.

Absolute keyword values have the following ordering, from narrowest to widest:

- ultra-condensed
- extra-condensed
- condensed
- semi-condensed
- normal
- semi-expanded
- expanded
- extra-expanded
- ultra-expanded

## font: [family] [style] [variant] [stretch] [size];

A shorthand for setting a few font properties at once.
- Supports any format accepted by `pango::FontDescription::from_string`
- Note: this is somewhat different from the CSS2 Specification for this property.

```

## border-image-source: [none|url|linear-gradient]{1,4};

Defines the image to use instead of the style of the border. If
this property is set to none, the style defined by border-style is
used instead.

```text
 border-image-source: url("/path/to/image.png");
```

## border-image-slice: [number|percentage]{1,4};

Divides the image specified by border-image-source in nine regions:
the four corners, the four edges and the middle. It does this by
specifying 4 inwards offsets.
- Four values used to specify: top right bottom left;
- Three values used to specify: top vertical bottom

central right edge, bottom-right corner, central bottom edge,
bottom-left corner, and central right edge. They represent inward
distance from the top, right, bottom, and left edges.
- Four values used to specify: top right bottom left;
- Three values used to specify: top horizontal bottom

- One value used to specify: width

```text
 border-image-width: 4px 0 4px 0;
```

## border-image-repeat: [none|url|linear-gradient]{1,4};

Defines how the middle part of a border image is handled to match
the size of the border. It has a one-value syntax which describes
the behavior for all sides, and a two-value syntax that sets a
different value for the horizontal and vertical behavior.
- Two values used to specify: horizontal vertical
- One value used to specify: repeat

```text
 border-image-repeat: stretch;
```

## background-image: [none|url|linear-gradient], ...
Sets one or several background images for an element. The images
are drawn on successive stacking context layers, with the first
specified being drawn as if it is the closest to the user. The
borders of the element are then drawn on top of them, and the
background-color is drawn beneath them.
- There can be several sources listed, separated by commas.

```text
 background-image: gtk-gradient (linear,
                                 left top, right top,
                                 from (#fff), to (#000));
```

## background-repeat: [repeat|no-repeat|space|round|repeat-x|repeat-y];

Defines how background images are repeated. A background image can
be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both, or
not repeated at all.
- `repeat`: The image is repeated in the given direction as much as
 needed to cover the whole background image painting area. The
 last image may be clipped if the whole thing won't fit in the
 remaining area.
- `space`: The image is repeated in the given direction as much as
 needed to cover most of the background image painting area,
 without clipping an image. The remaining non-covered space is
 spaced out evenly between the images. The first and last images
 touches the edge of the element. The value of the
 background-position CSS property is ignored for the concerned
 direction, except if one single image is greater than the
 background image painting area, which is the only case where an
 image can be clipped when the space value is used.
- `round`: The image is repeated in the given direction as much as
 needed to cover most of the background image painting area,
 without clipping an image. If it doesn't cover exactly the area,
 the tiles are resized in that direction in order to match it.
- `no-repeat`: The image is not repeated (and hence the background
 image painting area will not necessarily been entirely
 covered). The position of the non-repeated background image is
 defined by the background-position CSS property.
- Note if not specified, the style doesn’t respect the CSS3
 specification, since the background will be stretched to fill
 the area.

```text
 background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

## text-shadow: horizontal_offset vertical_offset [ blur_radius ] color;

A shadow list can be applied to text or symbolic icons, using the CSS3
text-shadow syntax, as defined in the
[CSS3 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/`text`-shadow).

- The offset of the shadow is specified with the
`horizontal_offset` and `vertical_offset` parameters.
- The optional blur radius is parsed, but it is currently not
rendered by the GTK+ theming engine.

To set a shadow on an icon, use the `icon-shadow` property instead,
with the same syntax.

To set multiple shadows on an element, you can specify a comma-separated list
of shadow elements in the `text-shadow` or `icon-shadow` property. Shadows are
always rendered front to back (i.e. the first shadow specified is on top of the
others). Shadows can thus overlay each other, but they can never overlay the
text or icon itself, which is always rendered on top of the shadow layer.


```text
  text-shadow: 1 1 0 blue, -4 -4 red;
```

## box-shadow: [ inset ] horizontal_offset vertical_offset [ blur_radius ] [ spread ] color;

Themes can apply shadows on framed elements using the CSS3 box-shadow syntax,
as defined in the
[CSS3 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/`the`-box-shadow).

- A positive offset will draw a shadow that is offset to the right (down) of the box,
- A negative offset to the left (top).
- The optional spread parameter defines an additional distance to
expand the shadow shape in all directions, by the specified radius.
- The optional blur radius parameter is parsed, but it is currently not rendered by
the GTK+ theming engine.
- The inset parameter defines whether the drop shadow should be rendered inside or outside
the box canvas.

To set multiple box-shadows on an element, you can specify a comma-separated list
of shadow elements in the `box-shadow` property. Shadows are always rendered
front to back (i.e. the first shadow specified is on top of the others) so they may
overlap other boxes or other shadows.


```text
  box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px alpha(black, 0.1);
```

## transition: duration [s|ms] [linear|ease|ease-in|ease-out|ease-in-out] [loop];

Styles can specify transitions that will be used to create a
gradual change in the appearance when a widget state changes.
- The `duration` is the amount of time that the animation will take
for a complete cycle from start to end.
- If the loop option is given, the animation will be repated until
the state changes again.
- The option after the duration determines the transition function
from a small set of predefined functions.

- Linear

 ![](linear.png)

- Ease transition

![](ease.png)

- Ease-in-out transition

![](ease-in-out.png)

- Ease-in transition

![](ease-in.png)

- Ease-out transition

```text
  transition: 150ms ease-in-out;
```

## Other Properties

`GtkThemingEngines` can register their own, engine-specific style properties
with the function `ThemingEngine::register_property`. These properties
can be set in CSS like other properties, using a name of the form
`-namespace-name`, where namespace is typically
the name of the theming engine, and name is the
name of the property. Style properties that have been registered by widgets
using `WidgetClass::install_style_property` can also be set in this
way, using the widget class name for namespace.

An example for using engine-specific style properties:

```text
* {
    engine: clearlooks;
    border-radius: 4;
    -GtkPaned-handle-size: 6;
    -clearlooks-colorize-scrollbar: false;
}
```

Returns the line in the CSS document where this section end.
The line number is 0-indexed, so the first line of the document
will return 0.
This value may change in future invocations of this function if
`self` is not yet parsed completely. This will for example
happen in the `CssProvider`::parsing-error signal.

position and line for sections which failed to parse anything
successfully.

# Returns

the offset in bytes from the start of the line.

The different types of sections indicate parts of a CSS document as
parsed by GTK’s CSS parser. They are oriented towards the
[CSS Grammar](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html),
but may contain extensions.

More types might be added in the future as the parser incorporates
more features.
<!-- enum CssSectionType::variant Document -->
The section describes a complete document.
 This section time is the only one where `CssSection::get_parent`
 might return `None`.
<!-- enum CssSectionType::variant Import -->
The section defines an import rule.

The section defines a binding set. This
 is a GTK extension to CSS.
<!-- enum CssSectionType::variant Ruleset -->
The section defines a CSS ruleset.
<!-- enum CssSectionType::variant Selector -->

 refers to the visible lines, with respect to to the current line
 breaks. As opposed to paragraphs, which are defined by line
 breaks in the input.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant DisplayLineEnds -->
Delete only the portion of the
 display-line to the left/right of cursor.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant ParagraphEnds -->
Delete to the end of the
 paragraph. Like C-k in Emacs (or its reverse).
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Paragraphs -->
Delete entire line. Like C-k in pico.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Whitespace -->

<!-- struct Dialog -->
Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
of input, e.g. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.

GTK+ treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a
`VBox`, and is where widgets such as a `Label` or a `Entry` should
be packed. The bottom area is known as the
“action area”. This is generally used for
packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as
cancel, ok, or apply.

`Dialog` boxes are created with a call to `Dialog::new` or
`Dialog::new_with_buttons`. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` is
recommended; it allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient
flags, and add simple buttons.

If “dialog” is a newly created dialog, the two primary areas of the
window can be accessed through `DialogExt::get_content_area` and
`DialogExt::get_action_area`, as can be seen from the example below.

A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
from user input), can be created by calling `Window::set_modal` on the
dialog. Use the GTK_WINDOW() macro to cast the widget returned from
`Dialog::new` into a `Window`. When using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`
you can also pass the `DialogFlags::Modal` flag to make a dialog modal.

If you add buttons to `Dialog` using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`,
`DialogExt::add_button`, `DialogExt::add_buttons`, or
`DialogExt::add_action_widget`, clicking the button will emit a signal
called `Dialog::response` with a response ID that you specified. GTK+
will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely
user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the
`ResponseType` enumeration (these all have values less than zero). If
a dialog receives a delete event, the `Dialog::response` signal will
be emitted with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.

If you want to block waiting for a dialog to return before returning
control flow to your code, you can call `DialogExt::run`. This function
enters a recursive main loop and waits for the user to respond to the
dialog, returning the response ID corresponding to the button the user
clicked.

For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you’d probably
use `MessageDialog` to save yourself some effort. But you’d need to
create the dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message
in the dialog.

An example for simple `Dialog` usage:

```C
// Function to open a dialog box with a message
void
quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, gchar *message)
{
 GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
 GtkDialogFlags flags;

 // Create the widgets
 flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
                                       parent,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
                                       NULL);
 content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 label = gtk_label_new (message);

 // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds

 g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
                           "response",
                           G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy),
                           dialog);

 // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added

 gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (content_area), label);
 gtk_widget_show_all (dialog);
}
```

# `Dialog` as `Buildable`

The `Dialog` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes the
`vbox` and `action_area` as internal children with the names “vbox” and
“action_area”.

`Dialog` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`). To mark a response
as default, set the “default“ attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
to true.

`Dialog` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action“ as
the “type“ attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
on the “use-header-bar“ property. The response id has to be associated
with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.

An example of a `Dialog` UI definition fragment:

```text
<object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>
  </child>
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok">
      <property name="can-default">True</property>
    </object>
  </child>
  <action-widgets>
    <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>
    <action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget>
  </action-widgets>
</object>
```

<!-- impl Dialog::fn new -->
Creates a new dialog box.

Widgets should not be packed into this `Window`
directly, but into the `vbox` and `action_area`, as described above.

# Returns

the new dialog as a `Widget`
<!-- impl Dialog::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `Dialog` with title `title` (or `None` for the default
title; see `Window::set_title`) and transient parent `parent` (or
`None` for none; see `Window::set_transient_for`). The `flags`
argument can be used to make the dialog modal (`DialogFlags::Modal`)
and/or to have it destroyed along with its transient parent
(`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent`). After `flags`, button
text/response ID pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending
the list. Button text can be arbitrary text. A response ID can be
any positive number, or one of the values in the `ResponseType`
enumeration. If the user clicks one of these dialog buttons,
`Dialog` will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with the corresponding
response ID. If a `Dialog` receives the `Widget::delete-event` signal,
it will emit ::response with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.
However, destroying a dialog does not emit the ::response signal;
so be careful relying on ::response when using the
`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent` flag. Buttons are from left to right,
so the first button in the list will be the leftmost button in the dialog.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("My dialog",
                                       main_app_window,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                       _("_Cancel"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_REJECT,
                                       NULL);
```
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`
## `flags`
from `DialogFlags`
## `first_button_text`
text to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Dialog`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_action_widget -->
Adds an activatable widget to the action area of a `Dialog`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `Dialog::response`
signal on the dialog when the widget is activated. The widget is
appended to the end of the dialog’s action area. If you want to add a
non-activatable widget, simply pack it into the `action_area` field
of the `Dialog` struct.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with
the given `response_id`. The button is appended to the end of the
dialog’s action area. The button widget is returned, but usually
you don’t need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget that was added
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `DialogExt::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `Dialog::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_action_area -->
Returns the action area of `self`.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Direct access to the action area
 is discouraged; use `DialogExt::add_button`, etc.

# Returns

the action area
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_content_area -->
Returns the content area of `self`.

# Returns

the content area `Box`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_header_bar -->
Returns the header bar of `self`. Note that the
headerbar is only used by the dialog if the
`Dialog:use-header-bar` property is `true`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

the header bar
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_response_for_widget -->
Gets the response id of a widget in the action area
of a dialog.
## `widget`
a widget in the action area of `self`

# Returns

the response id of `widget`, or `ResponseType::None`
 if `widget` doesn’t have a response id set.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_widget_for_response -->
Gets the widget button that uses the given response ID in the action area
of a dialog.
## `response_id`
the response ID used by the `self` widget

# Returns

the `widget` button that uses the given
 `response_id`, or `None`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn response -->
Emits the `Dialog::response` signal with the given response ID.
Used to indicate that the user has responded to the dialog in some way;
typically either you or `DialogExt::run` will be monitoring the
::response signal and take appropriate action.
## `response_id`
response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn run -->
Blocks in a recursive main loop until the `self` either emits the
`Dialog::response` signal, or is destroyed. If the dialog is
destroyed during the call to `DialogExt::run`, `DialogExt::run` returns
`ResponseType::None`. Otherwise, it returns the response ID from the
::response signal emission.

Before entering the recursive main loop, `DialogExt::run` calls
`Widget::show` on the dialog for you. Note that you still
need to show any children of the dialog yourself.

During `DialogExt::run`, the default behavior of `Widget::delete-event`
is disabled; if the dialog receives ::delete_event, it will not be
destroyed as windows usually are, and `DialogExt::run` will return
`ResponseType::DeleteEvent`. Also, during `DialogExt::run` the dialog
will be modal. You can force `DialogExt::run` to return at any time by
calling `DialogExt::response` to emit the ::response signal. Destroying
the dialog during `DialogExt::run` is a very bad idea, because your
post-run code won’t know whether the dialog was destroyed or not.

After `DialogExt::run` returns, you are responsible for hiding or
destroying the dialog if you wish to do so.

Typical usage of this function might be:

```C
  gint result = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
  switch (result)
    {
      case GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT:
         do_application_specific_something ();
         break;
      default:
         do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled ();
         break;
    }
  gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

Note that even though the recursive main loop gives the effect of a
modal dialog (it prevents the user from interacting with other
windows in the same window group while the dialog is run), callbacks
such as timeouts, IO channel watches, DND drops, etc, will
be triggered during a `DialogExt::run` call.

# Returns

response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_alternative_button_order -->
Sets an alternative button order. If the
`Settings:gtk-alternative-button-order` setting is set to `true`,
the dialog buttons are reordered according to the order of the
response ids passed to this function.

By default, GTK+ dialogs use the button order advocated by the
[GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/)
with the affirmative button at the far
right, and the cancel button left of it. But the builtin GTK+ dialogs
and ``GtkMessageDialogs`` do provide an alternative button order,
which is more suitable on some platforms, e.g. Windows.

Use this function after adding all the buttons to your dialog, as the
following example shows:


```C
cancel_button = gtk_dialog_add_button (GTK_DIALOG (dialog),
                                       _("_Cancel"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL);

ok_button = gtk_dialog_add_button (GTK_DIALOG (dialog),
                                   _("_OK"),
                                   GTK_RESPONSE_OK);

gtk_widget_grab_default (ok_button);

help_button = gtk_dialog_add_button (GTK_DIALOG (dialog),
                                     _("_Help"),
                                     GTK_RESPONSE_HELP);

gtk_dialog_set_alternative_button_order (GTK_DIALOG (dialog),
                                         GTK_RESPONSE_OK,
                                         GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                         GTK_RESPONSE_HELP,
                                         -1);
```

<!-- struct DrawingArea -->
The `DrawingArea` widget is used for creating custom user interface
elements. It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:

- Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from
 the user. (Use `Widget::add_events` to enable events
 you wish to receive.)

- The `Widget::realize` signal to take any necessary actions
 when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
 (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)

- The `Widget::size-allocate` signal to take any necessary
 actions when the widget changes size.

- The `Widget::draw` signal to handle redrawing the
 contents of the widget.

The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
color.

Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area to the
background color before sending the expose event, and that
drawing is implicitly clipped to the exposed area.

## Simple `DrawingArea` usage


```C
gboolean
draw_callback (GtkWidget *widget, cairo_t *cr, gpointer data)
{

Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes
onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
You can also force an expose event by adding to the “damage region”
of the drawing area’s window; `Widget::queue_draw_area` and
`gdk::Window::invalidate_rect` are equally good ways to do this.
You’ll then get a draw signal for the invalid region.

The available routines for drawing are documented on the
[GDK Drawing Primitives][gdk3-Cairo-Interaction] page
and the cairo documentation.

To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable
them with `Widget::add_events`. To receive keyboard events, you
will need to set the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you
should probably draw some user-visible indication that the drawing
area is focused. Use `Widget::has_focus` in your expose event
handler to decide whether to draw the focus indicator. See
`gtk_render_focus` for one way to draw focus.

<!-- struct Editable -->
The `Editable` interface is an interface which should be implemented by
text editing widgets, such as `Entry` and `SpinButton`. It contains functions
for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
connect to to modify the behavior of a widget.

As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
the following handler to `Editable::insert-text`, an application
can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.

## Forcing entry to uppercase.


```C
#include <ctype.h>;

void
insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                     const gchar *text,
                     gint         length,
                     gint        *position,
                     gpointer     data)
{
  gchar *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);

  g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                               (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);

puts it on the clipboard.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn cut_clipboard -->
Removes the contents of the currently selected content in the editable and
puts it on the clipboard.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn delete_selection -->
Deletes the currently selected text of the editable.
This call doesn’t do anything if there is no selected text.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn delete_text -->
Deletes a sequence of characters. The characters that are deleted are
those characters at positions from `start_pos` up to, but not including
`end_pos`. If `end_pos` is negative, then the characters deleted
are those from `start_pos` to the end of the text.

Note that the positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
start position
## `end_pos`
end position
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn get_chars -->
Retrieves a sequence of characters. The characters that are retrieved
are those characters at positions from `start_pos` up to, but not
including `end_pos`. If `end_pos` is negative, then the characters
retrieved are those characters from `start_pos` to the end of the text.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
start of text
## `end_pos`
end of text

# Returns

a pointer to the contents of the widget as a
 string. This string is allocated by the `Editable`
 implementation and should be freed by the caller.

of the content of the editable.

Note that this position is in characters, not in bytes.

# Returns

the cursor position
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Retrieves the selection bound of the editable. start_pos will be filled
with the start of the selection and `end_pos` with end. If no text was
selected both will be identical and `false` will be returned.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.

## `new_text_length`
the length of the text in bytes, or -1
## `position`
location of the position text will be inserted at
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn paste_clipboard -->
Pastes the content of the clipboard to the current position of the
cursor in the editable.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn select_region -->
Selects a region of text. The characters that are selected are
those characters at positions from `start_pos` up to, but not
including `end_pos`. If `end_pos` is negative, then the
characters selected are those characters from `start_pos` to
the end of the text.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
start of region
## `end_pos`
end of region
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_editable -->
Determines if the user can edit the text in the editable
widget or not.
## `is_editable`
`true` if the user is allowed to edit the text
 in the widget
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_position -->
Sets the cursor position in the editable to the given value.

The cursor is displayed before the character with the given (base 0)
index in the contents of the editable. The value must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the editable. A value of -1
indicates that the position should be set after the last character
of the editable. Note that `position` is in characters, not in bytes.
## `position`
the position of the cursor
<!-- struct Entry -->
The `Entry` widget is a single line text entry
widget. A fairly large set of key bindings are supported
by default. If the entered text is longer than the allocation
of the widget, the widget will scroll so that the cursor
position is visible.

When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
it can be put into “password mode” using `EntryExt::set_visibility`.
In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character that is available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`. Since 2.16, GTK+ displays a warning
when Caps Lock or input methods might interfere with entering text in
a password entry. The warning can be turned off with the
`Entry:caps-lock-warning` property.

Since 2.16, `Entry` has the ability to display progress or activity
information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
use `EntryExt::set_progress_fraction` or `EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`.

Additionally, `Entry` can show icons at either side of the entry. These
icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source and
can have tooltips. To add an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_from_gicon` or
one of the various other functions that set an icon from a stock id, an
icon name or a pixbuf. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon,
connect to the `Entry::icon-press` signal. To allow DND operations
from an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_drag_source`. To set a tooltip on
an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text` or the corresponding function
for markup.

Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
via the context menu of the entry.

Icon position

# Returns

A stock id, or `None` if no icon is set or if the icon
 wasn’t set from a stock id
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_icon_storage_type -->
Gets the type of representation being used by the icon
to store image data. If the icon has no image data,
the return value will be `ImageType::Empty`.

for entries with visibility set to false. See `EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

# Returns

the current invisible char, or 0, if the entry does not
 show invisible text at all.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the entry.
The layout is useful to e.g. convert text positions to
pixel positions, in combination with `EntryExt::get_layout_offsets`.
The returned layout is owned by the entry and must not be
modified or freed by the caller.

Keep in mind that the layout text may contain a preedit string, so
`EntryExt::layout_index_to_text_index` and
`EntryExt::text_index_to_layout_index` are needed to convert byte
indices in the layout to byte indices in the entry contents.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this entry
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the position of the `pango::Layout` used to render text
in the entry, in widget coordinates. Useful if you want to line
up the text in an entry with some other text, e.g. when using the
entry to implement editable cells in a sheet widget.

Also useful to convert mouse events into coordinates inside the
`pango::Layout`, e.g. to take some action if some part of the entry text
is clicked.

Note that as the user scrolls around in the entry the offsets will
change; you’ll need to connect to the “notify::scroll-offset”
signal to track this. Remember when using the `pango::Layout`
functions you need to convert to and from pixels using
PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.

Keep in mind that the layout text may contain a preedit string, so
`EntryExt::layout_index_to_text_index` and
`EntryExt::text_index_to_layout_index` are needed to convert byte
indices in the layout to byte indices in the entry contents.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_max_length -->
Retrieves the maximum allowed length of the text in
`self`. See `EntryExt::set_max_length`.

This is equivalent to:


```C
GtkEntryBuffer *buffer;
buffer = gtk_entry_get_buffer (entry);
gtk_entry_buffer_get_max_length (buffer);
```

# Returns

the maximum allowed number of characters
 in `Entry`, or 0 if there is no maximum.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_max_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired maximum width of `self`, in characters.
See `EntryExt::set_max_width_chars`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

the maximum width of the entry, in characters
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_overwrite_mode -->
Gets the value set by `EntryExt::set_overwrite_mode`.

# Returns

whether the text is overwritten when typing.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_placeholder_text -->
Retrieves the text that will be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused

# Returns

a pointer to the placeholder text as a string. This string points to internally allocated
storage in the widget and must not be freed, modified or stored.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_progress_fraction -->
Returns the current fraction of the task that’s been completed.
See `EntryExt::set_progress_fraction`.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_progress_pulse_step -->
Retrieves the pulse step set with `EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_tabs -->
Gets the tabstops that were set on the entry using `EntryExt::set_tabs`, if
any.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the tabstops, or `None` if none was set.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the contents of the entry widget.
See also `Editable::get_chars`.

This is equivalent to:


```C
GtkEntryBuffer *buffer;
buffer = gtk_entry_get_buffer (entry);
gtk_entry_buffer_get_text (buffer);
```

# Returns

a pointer to the contents of the widget as a
 string. This string points to internally allocated
 storage in the widget and must not be freed, modified or
 stored.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_text_area -->
Gets the area where the entry’s text is drawn. This function is
useful when drawing something to the entry in a draw callback.

If the entry is not realized, `text_area` is filled with zeros.

See also `EntryExt::get_icon_area`.
## `text_area`
Return location for the text area.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_text_length -->
Retrieves the current length of the text in
`self`.

This is equivalent to:


```C
GtkEntryBuffer *buffer;
buffer = gtk_entry_get_buffer (entry);
gtk_entry_buffer_get_length (buffer);
```

# Returns

the current number of characters
 in `Entry`, or 0 if there are none.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_visibility -->
Retrieves whether the text in `self` is visible. See
`EntryExt::set_visibility`.

# Returns

`true` if the text is currently visible
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_width_chars -->
Gets the value set by `EntryExt::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

number of chars to request space for, or negative if unset
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn grab_focus_without_selecting -->
Causes `self` to have keyboard focus.

It behaves like `Widget::grab_focus`,
except that it doesn't select the contents of the entry.
You only want to call this on some special entries
which the user usually doesn't want to replace all text in,
such as search-as-you-type entries.

Feature: `v3_16`

<!-- trait EntryExt::fn im_context_filter_keypress -->
Allow the `Entry` input method to internally handle key press
and release events. If this function returns `true`, then no further
processing should be done for this key event. See
`IMContext::filter_keypress`.

Note that you are expected to call this function from your handler
when overriding key event handling. This is needed in the case when
you need to insert your own key handling between the input method
and the default key event handling of the `Entry`.
See `TextView::reset_im_context` for an example of use.
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn layout_index_to_text_index -->
Converts from a position in the entry contents (returned
by `EntryExt::get_text`) to a position in the
entry’s `pango::Layout` (returned by `EntryExt::get_layout`,
with text retrieved via `pango::Layout::get_text`).
## `layout_index`
byte index into the entry layout text

# Returns

byte index into the entry contents
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn progress_pulse -->
Indicates that some progress is made, but you don’t know how much.
Causes the entry’s progress indicator to enter “activity mode,”
where a block bounces back and forth. Each call to
`EntryExt::progress_pulse` causes the block to move by a little bit
(the amount of movement per pulse is determined by
`EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`).
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn reset_im_context -->
Reset the input method context of the entry if needed.

This can be necessary in the case where modifying the buffer
would confuse on-going input method behavior.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_activates_default -->
If `setting` is `true`, pressing Enter in the `self` will activate the default
widget for the window containing the entry. This usually means that
the dialog box containing the entry will be closed, since the default
widget is usually one of the dialog buttons.

(For experts: if `setting` is `true`, the entry calls
`Window::activate_default` on the window containing the entry, in
the default handler for the `Entry::activate` signal.)
## `setting`
`true` to activate window’s default widget on Enter keypress
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_alignment -->
Sets the alignment for the contents of the entry. This controls
the horizontal positioning of the contents when the displayed
text is shorter than the width of the entry.
## `xalign`
The horizontal alignment, from 0 (left) to 1 (right).
 Reversed for RTL layouts
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
entry text.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_buffer -->
Set the `EntryBuffer` object which holds the text for
this widget.
## `buffer`
a `EntryBuffer`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_completion -->
Sets `completion` to be the auxiliary completion object to use with `self`.
All further configuration of the completion mechanism is done on
`completion` using the `EntryCompletion` API. Completion is disabled if
`completion` is set to `None`.
## `completion`
The `EntryCompletion` or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_cursor_hadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to the cursor position in an entry, so that when
the cursor is moved, the adjustment is scrolled to show that position.
See `ScrolledWindow::get_hadjustment` for a typical way of obtaining
the adjustment.

The adjustment has to be in pixel units and in the same coordinate system
as the entry.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted when the cursor
 is moved, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_has_frame -->
Sets whether the entry has a beveled frame around it.
## `setting`
new value
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_activatable -->
Sets whether the icon is activatable.
## `icon_pos`
Icon position
## `activatable`
`true` if the icon should be activatable
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_drag_source -->
Sets up the icon at the given position so that GTK+ will start a drag
operation when the user clicks and drags the icon.

To handle the drag operation, you need to connect to the usual
`Widget::drag-data-get` (or possibly `Widget::drag-data-delete`)
signal, and use `EntryExt::get_current_icon_drag_source` in
your signal handler to find out if the drag was started from
an icon.

By default, GTK+ uses the icon as the drag icon. You can use the
`Widget::drag-begin` signal to set a different icon. Note that you
have to use `g_signal_connect_after` to ensure that your signal handler
gets executed after the default handler.
## `icon_pos`
icon position
## `target_list`
the targets (data formats) in which the data can be provided
## `actions`
a bitmask of the allowed drag actions
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_gicon -->
Sets the icon shown in the entry at the specified position
from the current icon theme.
If the icon isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be displayed
instead.

If `icon` is `None`, no icon will be shown in the specified position.
## `icon_pos`
The position at which to set the icon
## `icon`
The icon to set, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_icon_name -->
Sets the icon shown in the entry at the specified position
from the current icon theme.

If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be displayed
instead.

If `icon_name` is `None`, no icon will be shown in the specified position.
## `icon_pos`
The position at which to set the icon
## `icon_name`
An icon name, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_pixbuf -->
Sets the icon shown in the specified position using a pixbuf.

Icon position
## `pixbuf`
A `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_stock -->
Sets the icon shown in the entry at the specified position from
a stock image.

## `sensitive`
Specifies whether the icon should appear
 sensitive or insensitive
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_tooltip_markup -->
Sets `tooltip` as the contents of the tooltip for the icon at
the specified position. `tooltip` is assumed to be marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `Widget::set_tooltip_markup` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text`.
## `icon_pos`
the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_tooltip_text -->
Sets `tooltip` as the contents of the tooltip for the icon
at the specified position.

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `Widget::set_tooltip_text` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_markup`.
## `icon_pos`
the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_inner_border -->
Sets `entry`’s inner-border property to `border`, or clears it if `None`
is passed. The inner-border is the area around the entry’s text, but
inside its frame.

If set, this property overrides the inner-border style property.
Overriding the style-provided border is useful when you want to do
in-place editing of some text in a canvas or list widget, where
pixel-exact positioning of the entry is important.

# Deprecated since 3.4

Use the standard border and padding CSS properties (through
 objects like `StyleContext` and `CssProvider`); the value set with
 this function is ignored by `Entry`.
## `border`
a `Border`, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_input_hints -->
Sets the `Entry:input-hints` property, which
allows input methods to fine-tune their behaviour.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `hints`
the hints
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_input_purpose -->
Sets the `Entry:input-purpose` property which
can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `purpose`
the purpose
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_invisible_char -->
Sets the character to use in place of the actual text when
`EntryExt::set_visibility` has been called to set text visibility
to `false`. i.e. this is the character used in “password mode” to
show the user how many characters have been typed. By default, GTK+
picks the best invisible char available in the current font. If you
set the invisible char to 0, then the user will get no feedback
at all; there will be no text on the screen as they type.
## `ch`
a Unicode character
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the widget. If
the current contents are longer than the given length, then they
will be truncated to fit.

This is equivalent to:


```C
GtkEntryBuffer *buffer;
buffer = gtk_entry_get_buffer (entry);
gtk_entry_buffer_set_max_length (buffer, max);
```
## `max`
the maximum length of the entry, or 0 for no maximum.
 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_max_width_chars -->
Sets the desired maximum width in characters of `self`.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `n_chars`
the new desired maximum width, in characters
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_overwrite_mode -->
Sets whether the text is overwritten when typing in the `Entry`.
## `overwrite`
new value
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_placeholder_text -->
Sets text to be displayed in `self` when it is empty and unfocused.
This can be used to give a visual hint of the expected contents of
the `Entry`.

Note that since the placeholder text gets removed when the entry
received focus, using this feature is a bit problematic if the entry
is given the initial focus in a window. Sometimes this can be
worked around by delaying the initial focus setting until the
first key event arrives.
## `text`
a string to be displayed when `self` is empty an unfocused, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_fraction -->
Causes the entry’s progress indicator to “fill in” the given
fraction of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_pulse_step -->
Sets the fraction of total entry width to move the progress
bouncing block for each call to `EntryExt::progress_pulse`.
## `fraction`
fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_tabs -->
Sets a `pango::TabArray`; the tabstops in the array are applied to the entry
text.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `tabs`
a `pango::TabArray`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_text -->
Sets the text in the widget to the given
value, replacing the current contents.

See `EntryBuffer::set_text`.
## `text`
the new text
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_visibility -->
Sets whether the contents of the entry are visible or not.
When visibility is set to `false`, characters are displayed
as the invisible char, and will also appear that way when
the text in the entry widget is copied elsewhere.

By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

Note that you probably want to set `Entry:input-purpose`
to `InputPurpose::Password` or `InputPurpose::Pin` to
inform input methods about the purpose of this entry,
in addition to setting visibility to `false`.
## `visible`
`true` if the contents of the entry are displayed
 as plaintext
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_width_chars -->
Changes the size request of the entry to be about the right size
for `n_chars` characters. Note that it changes the size
request, the size can still be affected by
how you pack the widget into containers. If `n_chars` is -1, the
size reverts to the default entry size.
## `n_chars`
width in chars
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn text_index_to_layout_index -->
Converts from a position in the entry’s `pango::Layout` (returned by
`EntryExt::get_layout`) to a position in the entry contents
(returned by `EntryExt::get_text`).
## `text_index`
byte index into the entry contents

# Returns

byte index into the entry layout text
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn unset_invisible_char -->
Unsets the invisible char previously set with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`. So that the
default invisible char is used again.
<!-- struct EntryBuffer -->
The `EntryBuffer` class contains the actual text displayed in a
`Entry` widget.

A single `EntryBuffer` object can be shared by multiple `Entry`
widgets which will then share the same text content, but not the cursor
position, visibility attributes, icon etc.

`EntryBuffer` may be derived from. Such a derived class might allow
text to be stored in an alternate location, such as non-pageable memory,
useful in the case of important passwords. Or a derived class could
integrate with an application’s concept of undo/redo.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn new -->
Create a new `EntryBuffer` object.

Optionally, specify initial text to set in the buffer.
## `initial_chars`
initial buffer text, or `None`
## `n_initial_chars`
number of characters in `initial_chars`, or -1

# Returns

A new `EntryBuffer` object.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn delete_text -->
Deletes a sequence of characters from the buffer. `n_chars` characters are
deleted starting at `position`. If `n_chars` is negative, then all characters
until the end of the text are deleted.

If `position` or `n_chars` are out of bounds, then they are coerced to sane
values.

Note that the positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `position`
position at which to delete text
## `n_chars`
number of characters to delete

# Returns

The number of characters deleted.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn emit_deleted_text -->
Used when subclassing `EntryBuffer`
## `position`
position at which text was deleted
## `n_chars`
number of characters deleted
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn emit_inserted_text -->
Used when subclassing `EntryBuffer`
## `position`
position at which text was inserted
## `chars`
text that was inserted
## `n_chars`
number of characters inserted
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn get_bytes -->
Retrieves the length in bytes of the buffer.
See `EntryBuffer::get_length`.

# Returns

The byte length of the buffer.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn get_length -->
Retrieves the length in characters of the buffer.

# Returns

The number of characters in the buffer.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn get_max_length -->
Retrieves the maximum allowed length of the text in
`self`. See `EntryBuffer::set_max_length`.

# Returns

the maximum allowed number of characters
 in `EntryBuffer`, or 0 if there is no maximum.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the contents of the buffer.

The memory pointer returned by this call will not change
unless this object emits a signal, or is finalized.

# Returns

a pointer to the contents of the widget as a
 string. This string points to internally allocated
 storage in the buffer and must not be freed, modified or
 stored.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn insert_text -->
Inserts `n_chars` characters of `chars` into the contents of the
buffer, at position `position`.

If `n_chars` is negative, then characters from chars will be inserted
until a null-terminator is found. If `position` or `n_chars` are out of
bounds, or the maximum buffer text length is exceeded, then they are
coerced to sane values.

Note that the position and length are in characters, not in bytes.
## `position`
the position at which to insert text.
## `chars`
the text to insert into the buffer.
## `n_chars`
the length of the text in characters, or -1

# Returns

The number of characters actually inserted.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the buffer. If
the current contents are longer than the given length, then they
will be truncated to fit.
## `max_length`
the maximum length of the entry buffer, or 0 for no maximum.
 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.
<!-- impl EntryBuffer::fn set_text -->
Sets the text in the buffer.

This is roughly equivalent to calling `EntryBuffer::delete_text`
and `EntryBuffer::insert_text`.

Note that `n_chars` is in characters, not in bytes.
## `chars`
the new text
## `n_chars`
the number of characters in `text`, or -1
<!-- struct EntryCompletion -->
`EntryCompletion` is an auxiliary object to be used in conjunction with
`Entry` to provide the completion functionality. It implements the
`CellLayout` interface, to allow the user to add extra cells to the
`TreeView` with completion matches.

“Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
in the entry, `EntryCompletion` checks which rows in the model match
the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
`EntryCompletion::set_text_column`), but this can be overridden
with a custom match function (see `EntryCompletion::set_match_func`).

When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
to the `EntryCompletion::match-selected` signal and updating the
entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return `true` from
the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.

To add completion functionality to an entry, use `EntryExt::set_completion`.

In addition to regular completion matches, which will be inserted into the
entry when they are selected, `EntryCompletion` also allows to display
“actions” in the popup window. Their appearance is similar to menuitems,
to differentiate them clearly from completion strings. When an action is
selected, the `EntryCompletion::action-activated` signal is emitted.

`EntryCompletion` uses a `TreeModelFilter` model to represent the
subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the
`EntryCompletion` signals `EntryCompletion::match-selected` and
`EntryCompletion::cursor-on-match` take the original model and an
iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and signals
(such as ``GtkCellLayoutDataFuncs`` or `CellArea::apply-attributes`)
will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
only calling `TreeModel::get`, this will make no difference to
you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
`TreeModelFilter::get_model`. Don’t forget to use
`TreeModelFilter::convert_iter_to_child_iter` to obtain a
matching iter.

current list with completions, using the current key. The completion list
view will be updated accordingly.
<!-- impl EntryCompletion::fn compute_prefix -->
Computes the common prefix that is shared by all rows in `self`
that start with `key`. If no row matches `key`, `None` will be returned.
Note that a text column must have been set for this function to work,
see `EntryCompletion::set_text_column` for details.

inside the entry.
## `inline_selection`
`true` to do inline selection
<!-- impl EntryCompletion::fn set_match_func -->
Sets the match function for `self` to be `func`. The match function
is used to determine if a row should or should not be in the completion
list.
## `func`
the ``GtkEntryCompletionMatchFunc`` to use
## `func_data`
user data for `func`
## `func_notify`
destroy notify for `func_data`.
<!-- impl EntryCompletion::fn set_minimum_key_length -->
Requires the length of the search key for `self` to be at least
`length`. This is useful for long lists, where completing using a small
key takes a lot of time and will come up with meaningless results anyway
(ie, a too large dataset).
## `length`
the minimum length of the key in order to start completing
<!-- impl EntryCompletion::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `EntryCompletion`. If `self` already has

 match
<!-- impl EntryCompletion::fn set_text_column -->
Convenience function for setting up the most used case of this code: a
completion list with just strings. This function will set up `self`
to have a list displaying all (and just) strings in the completion list,
and to get those strings from `column` in the model of `self`.

This functions creates and adds a `CellRendererText` for the selected
column. If you need to set the text column, but don't want the cell
renderer, use `gobject::Object::set` to set the `EntryCompletion:text-column`
property directly.
## `column`
the column in the model of `self` to get strings from
<!-- enum EntryIconPosition -->
Specifies the side of the entry at which an icon is placed.
<!-- enum EntryIconPosition::variant Primary -->
At the beginning of the entry (depending on the text direction).
<!-- enum EntryIconPosition::variant Secondary -->
At the end of the entry (depending on the text direction).
<!-- struct EventBox -->
The `EventBox` widget is a subclass of `Bin` which also has its
own window. It is useful since it allows you to catch events for widgets
which do not have their own window.

# Implements

[`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl EventBox::fn new -->
Creates a new `EventBox`.

# Returns

a new `EventBox`
<!-- impl EventBox::fn get_above_child -->
Returns whether the event box window is above or below the
windows of its child. See `EventBox::set_above_child`
for details.

# Returns

`true` if the event box window is above the
 window of its child
<!-- impl EventBox::fn get_visible_window -->
Returns whether the event box has a visible window.
See `EventBox::set_visible_window` for details.

# Returns

`true` if the event box window is visible
<!-- impl EventBox::fn set_above_child -->
Set whether the event box window is positioned above the windows
of its child, as opposed to below it. If the window is above, all
events inside the event box will go to the event box. If the window
is below, events in windows of child widgets will first got to that
widget, and then to its parents.

The default is to keep the window below the child.
## `above_child`
`true` if the event box window is above its child
<!-- impl EventBox::fn set_visible_window -->
Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible child
window. The default is to use visible windows.

In an invisible window event box, the window that the
event box creates is a `gdk::WindowWindowClass::InputOnly` window, which
means that it is invisible and only serves to receive
events.

A visible window event box creates a visible (`gdk::WindowWindowClass::InputOutput`)
window that acts as the parent window for all the widgets
contained in the event box.

You should generally make your event box invisible if
you just want to trap events. Creating a visible window
may cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especially
if the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.

The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if
you want to set the background to a different color or
draw on it.

There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has its
window below the child. (See `EventBox::set_above_child`.)
Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows
that descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these
windows aren’t propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+.
The practical effect of this is if an event isn’t in the event
mask for the descendant window (see `Widget::add_events`),
it won’t be received by the event box.

This problem doesn’t occur for visible event boxes, because in
that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the
descendant windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
## `visible_window`
`true` to make the event box have a visible window
<!-- struct EventController -->
`EventController` is a base, low-level implementation for event
controllers. Those react to a series of ``GdkEvents``, and possibly trigger
actions as a consequence of those.

<!-- trait EventControllerExt::fn get_propagation_phase -->
Gets the propagation phase at which `self` handles events.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

the propagation phase
<!-- trait EventControllerExt::fn get_widget -->
Returns the `Widget` this controller relates to.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

a `Widget`
<!-- trait EventControllerExt::fn handle_event -->
Feeds an events into `self`, so it can be interpreted
and the controller actions triggered.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `event`
a ``GdkEvent``

# Returns

`true` if the event was potentially useful to trigger the
 controller action
<!-- trait EventControllerExt::fn reset -->
Resets the `self` to a clean state. Every interaction
the controller did through `EventController::handle-event`
will be dropped at this point.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- trait EventControllerExt::fn set_propagation_phase -->
Sets the propagation phase at which a controller handles events.

If `phase` is `PropagationPhase::None`, no automatic event handling will be
performed, but other additional gesture maintenance will. In that phase,
the events can be managed by calling `EventControllerExt::handle_event`.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `phase`
a propagation phase
<!-- enum EventSequenceState -->
Describes the state of a `gdk::EventSequence` in a `Gesture`.
<!-- enum EventSequenceState::variant None -->
The sequence is handled, but not grabbed.
<!-- enum EventSequenceState::variant Claimed -->
The sequence is handled and grabbed.
<!-- enum EventSequenceState::variant Denied -->
The sequence is denied.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- struct Expander -->
A `Expander` allows the user to hide or show its child by clicking
on an expander triangle similar to the triangles used in a `TreeView`.

Normally you use an expander as you would use any other descendant
of `Bin`; you create the child widget and use `ContainerExt::add`
to add it to the expander. When the expander is toggled, it will take
care of showing and hiding the child automatically.

# Special Usage

There are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the
expanded widget yourself, such as when you want to actually create
the widget at expansion time. In this case, create a `Expander`
but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an
`Expander:expanded` property which can be used to monitor
its expansion state. You should watch this property with a signal
connection as follows:


```C
expander = gtk_expander_new_with_mnemonic ("_More Options");
g_signal_connect (expander, "notify::expanded",
                  G_CALLBACK (expander_callback), NULL);

...

static void
expander_callback (GObject    *object,
                   GParamSpec *param_spec,
                   gpointer    user_data)
{
  GtkExpander *expander;

  expander = GTK_EXPANDER (object);

  if (gtk_expander_get_expanded (expander))
    {
      // Show or create widgets
    }
  else
    {
      // Hide or destroy widgets
    }
}
```

# `Expander` as `Buildable`

The `Expander` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can be
specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Expander`:

```text
<object class="GtkExpander">
  <child type="label">
    <object class="GtkLabel" id="expander-label"/>
  </child>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkEntry" id="expander-content"/>
  </child>
</object>
```

<!-- impl Expander::fn new -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
## `label`
the text of the label

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- impl Expander::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
If characters in `label` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined.
If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use “__” (two
underscores). The first underlined character represents a keyboard
accelerator called a mnemonic.
Pressing Alt and that key activates the button.
## `label`
the text of the label with an underscore
 in front of the mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_expanded -->
Queries a `Expander` and returns its current state. Returns `true`
if the child widget is revealed.

See `Expander::set_expanded`.

# Returns

the current state of the expander
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup, as set by
`Expander::set_label`. If the label text has not been set the
return value will be `None`. This will be the case if you create an
empty button with `Button::new` to use as a container.

Note that this function behaved differently in versions prior to
2.14 and used to return the label text stripped of embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. This problem can
be avoided by fetching the label text directly from the label
widget.

# Returns

The text of the label widget. This string is owned
 by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_label_fill -->
Returns whether the label widget will fill all available
horizontal space allocated to `self`.

# Returns

`true` if the label widget will fill all
 available horizontal space
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_label_widget -->
Retrieves the label widget for the frame. See
`Expander::set_label_widget`.

# Returns

the label widget,
 or `None` if there is none
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_resize_toplevel -->
Returns whether the expander will resize the toplevel widget
containing the expander upon resizing and collpasing.

# Returns

the “resize toplevel” setting.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_spacing -->
Gets the value set by `Expander::set_spacing`.

# Returns

spacing between the expander and child
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_use_markup -->

`FileChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by file
selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
interface are `FileChooserWidget`, `FileChooserDialog`, and
`FileChooserButton`. You do not need to write an object that
implements the `FileChooser` interface unless you are trying to
adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
interface.

`FileChooser` allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

- Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
 right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
 can be renamed and deleted by the user.

- Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
 program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
 cannot be modified by the user.

- Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
 the “roots” of the filesystem.

# File Names and Encodings

When the user is finished selecting files in a
`FileChooser`, your program can get the selected names
either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal escaping
rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
However, filenames are always returned in
the character set specified by the
`G_FILENAME_ENCODING` environment variable.
Please see the GLib documentation for more details about this
variable.

This means that while you can pass the result of
`FileChooser::get_filename` to `open` or `fopen`,
you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a
`Label` widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8,
which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use `g_filename_to_utf8`
to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+
widgets.

# Adding a Preview Widget

You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then
get notification about when the preview needs to be updated.
To install a preview widget, use
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget`. Then, connect to the
`FileChooser::update-preview` signal to get notified when
you need to update the contents of the preview.

Your callback should use
`FileChooser::get_preview_filename` to see what needs
previewing. Once you have generated the preview for the
corresponding file, you must call
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active` with a boolean
flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully
generate a preview.

## Example: Using a Preview Widget ## {`gtkfilechooser`-preview}

```C
{
  GtkImage *preview;

  ...

  preview = gtk_image_new ();

  gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
  g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
            G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
}

static void
update_preview_cb (GtkFileChooser *file_chooser, gpointer data)
{
  GtkWidget *preview;
  char *filename;
  GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
  gboolean have_preview;

  preview = GTK_WIDGET (data);
  filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename (file_chooser);

  pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size (filename, 128, 128, NULL);
  have_preview = (pixbuf != NULL);
  g_free (filename);

  gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE (preview), pixbuf);
  if (pixbuf)
    g_object_unref (pixbuf);

  gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active (file_chooser, have_preview);
}
```

# Adding Extra Widgets

You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
that are not present in the default design. For example, you
can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a
file in read-only mode. You can use
`FileChooser::set_extra_widget` to insert additional
widgets in a file chooser.

An example for adding extra widgets:

```C

  GtkWidget *toggle;

  ...

  toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
  gtk_widget_show (toggle);
  gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
}
```

If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file
chooser, you can a container such as a `Box` or a `Grid`
and include your widgets in it. Then, set the container as
the whole extra widget.

# Implements

[`FileChooserExt`](trait.FileChooserExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt -->
Trait containing all `FileChooser` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserDialog`](struct.FileChooserDialog.html), [`FileChooserWidget`](struct.FileChooserWidget.html), [`FileChooser`](struct.FileChooser.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_filter -->
Adds `filter` to the list of filters that the user can select between.
When a filter is selected, only files that are passed by that
filter are displayed.

Note that the `self` takes ownership of the filter, so you have to
ref and sink it if you want to keep a reference.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_shortcut_folder -->
Adds a folder to be displayed with the shortcut folders in a file chooser.
Note that shortcut folders do not get saved, as they are provided by the
application. For example, you can use this to add a
“/usr/share/mydrawprogram/Clipart” folder to the volume list.
## `folder`
filename of the folder to add

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be added successfully, `false`
otherwise. In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_shortcut_folder_uri -->
Adds a folder URI to be displayed with the shortcut folders in a file
chooser. Note that shortcut folders do not get saved, as they are provided
by the application. For example, you can use this to add a
“file:///usr/share/mydrawprogram/Clipart” folder to the volume list.
## `uri`
URI of the folder to add

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be added successfully, `false`
otherwise. In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_action -->
Gets the type of operation that the file chooser is performing; see
`FileChooser::set_action`.

# Returns

the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_create_folders -->
Gets whether file choser will offer to create new folders.
See `FileChooser::set_create_folders`.

# Returns

`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as a local filename.
See `FileChooser::set_current_folder`.

Note that this is the folder that the file chooser is currently displaying
(e.g. "/home/username/Documents"), which is not the same
as the currently-selected folder if the chooser is in
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder` mode
(e.g. "/home/username/Documents/selected-folder/". To get the
currently-selected folder in that mode, use `FileChooser::get_uri` as the
usual way to get the selection.

# Returns

the full path of the current folder,
or `None` if the current path cannot be represented as a local
filename. Free with `g_free`. This function will also return
`None` if the file chooser was unable to load the last folder that
was requested from it; for example, as would be for calling
`FileChooser::set_current_folder` on a nonexistent folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder_file -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as `gio::File`.
See `FileChooser::get_current_folder_uri`.

# Returns

the `gio::File` for the current folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder_uri -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as an URI.
See `FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri`.

Note that this is the folder that the file chooser is currently displaying
(e.g. "file:///home/username/Documents"), which is not the same
as the currently-selected folder if the chooser is in
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder` mode
(e.g. "file:///home/username/Documents/selected-folder/". To get the
currently-selected folder in that mode, use `FileChooser::get_uri` as the
usual way to get the selection.

# Returns

the URI for the current folder. Free with `g_free`. This
function will also return `None` if the file chooser was unable to load the
last folder that was requested from it; for example, as would be for calling
`FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri` on a nonexistent folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_name -->
Gets the current name in the file selector, as entered by the user in the
text entry for “Name”.

This is meant to be used in save dialogs, to get the currently typed filename
when the file itself does not exist yet. For example, an application that
adds a custom extra widget to the file chooser for “file format” may want to
change the extension of the typed filename based on the chosen format, say,
from “.jpg” to “.png”.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

The raw text from the file chooser’s “Name” entry. Free this with
`g_free`. Note that this string is not a full pathname or URI; it is
whatever the contents of the entry are. Note also that this string is in
UTF-8 encoding, which is not necessarily the system’s encoding for filenames.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Queries whether a file chooser is set to confirm for overwriting when the user
types a file name that already exists.

# Returns

`true` if the file chooser will present a confirmation dialog;
`false` otherwise.

folder.

# Returns

a selected `gio::File`. You own the returned file;
 use `gobject::Object::unref` to release it.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filename -->
Gets the filename for the currently selected file in
the file selector. The filename is returned as an absolute path. If
multiple files are selected, one of the filenames will be returned at
random.

If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selected
folder.

# Returns

The currently selected filename, or `None`
 if no file is selected, or the selected file can't
 be represented with a local filename. Free with `g_free`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filenames -->
Lists all the selected files and subfolders in the current folder of
`self`. The returned names are full absolute paths. If files in the current
folder cannot be represented as local filenames they will be ignored. (See
`FileChooser::get_uris`)

Removes `filter` from the list of filters that the user can select between.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_shortcut_folder -->
Removes a folder from a file chooser’s list of shortcut folders.
## `folder`
filename of the folder to remove

# Returns

`true` if the operation succeeds, `false` otherwise.
In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.

See also: `FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_shortcut_folder_uri -->

## `uri`
URI of the folder to remove

# Returns

`true` if the operation succeeds, `false` otherwise.
In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.

See also: `FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder_uri`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_all -->
Selects all the files in the current folder of a file chooser.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_file -->
Selects the file referred to by `file`. An internal function. See
`_gtk_file_chooser_select_uri`.
## `file`
the file to select

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_filename -->
Selects a filename. If the file name isn’t in the current
folder of `self`, then the current folder of `self` will
be changed to the folder containing `filename`.
## `filename`
the filename to select

# Returns

Not useful.

See also: `FileChooser::set_filename`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_uri -->
Selects the file to by `uri`. If the URI doesn’t refer to a
file in the current folder of `self`, then the current folder of
`self` will be changed to the folder containing `filename`.
## `uri`
the URI to select

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_action -->
Sets the type of operation that the chooser is performing; the
user interface is adapted to suit the selected action. For example,
an option to create a new folder might be shown if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Save` but not if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `action`
the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_create_folders -->
Sets whether file choser will offer to create new folders.
This is only relevant if the action is not set to be
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `create_folders`
`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from a local filename.
The user will be shown the full contents of the current folder,
plus user interface elements for navigating to other folders.

In general, you should not use this function. See the
[section on setting up a file chooser dialog][gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up]
for the rationale behind this.
## `filename`
the full path of the new current folder

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder_file -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from a `gio::File`.
Internal function, see `FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri`.
## `file`
the `gio::File` for the new folder

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be changed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder_uri -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from an URI.
The user will be shown the full contents of the current folder,
plus user interface elements for navigating to other folders.

In general, you should not use this function. See the
[section on setting up a file chooser dialog][gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up]
for the rationale behind this.
## `uri`
the URI for the new current folder

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be changed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_name -->
Sets the current name in the file selector, as if entered
by the user. Note that the name passed in here is a UTF-8
string rather than a filename. This function is meant for
such uses as a suggested name in a “Save As...” dialog. You can
pass “Untitled.doc” or a similarly suitable suggestion for the `name`.

If you want to preselect a particular existing file, you should use
`FileChooser::set_filename` or `FileChooser::set_uri` instead.
Please see the documentation for those functions for an example of using
`FileChooser::set_current_name` as well.
## `name`
the filename to use, as a UTF-8 string
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Sets whether a file chooser in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode will present
a confirmation dialog if the user types a file name that already exists. This
is `false` by default.

If set to `true`, the `self` will emit the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal when appropriate.

If all you need is the stock confirmation dialog, set this property to `true`.
You can override the way confirmation is done by actually handling the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal; please refer to its documentation
for the details.
## `do_overwrite_confirmation`
whether to confirm overwriting in save mode
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_extra_widget -->
Sets an application-supplied widget to provide extra options to the user.
## `extra_widget`
widget for extra options
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_file -->
Sets `file` as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing
to the file’s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list. If
the `self` is in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the file’s base name
will also appear in the dialog’s file name entry.

If the file name isn’t in the current folder of `self`, then the current
folder of `self` will be changed to the folder containing `filename`. This
is equivalent to a sequence of `FileChooser::unselect_all` followed by
`FileChooser::select_filename`.

Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done except
for the directory change.

If you are implementing a save dialog,
you should use this function if you already have a file name to which the
user may save; for example, when the user opens an existing file and then
does Save As... If you don’t have
a file name already — for example, if the user just created a new
file and is saving it for the first time, do not call this function.
Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder_file (chooser, default_file_for_saving);
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file);
  }
```
## `file`
the `gio::File` to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_filename -->
Sets `filename` as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing to
the file’s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list; all other
files will be unselected. If the `self` is in
`FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the file’s base name will also appear in
the dialog’s file name entry.

Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done except
for the directory change.

You should use this function only when implementing a save
dialog for which you already have a file name to which
the user may save. For example, when the user opens an existing file and
then does Save As... to save a copy or
a modified version. If you don’t have a file name already — for
example, if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the first
time, do not call this function. Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser, existing_filename);
  }
```

In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestions
as to where to save his new file. In the second case, the file’s existing location
is already known, so the file chooser will use it.
## `filename`
the filename to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_filter -->
Sets the current filter; only the files that pass the
filter will be displayed. If the user-selectable list of filters
is non-empty, then the filter should be one of the filters
in that list. Setting the current filter when the list of
filters is empty is useful if you want to restrict the displayed
set of files without letting the user change it.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_local_only -->
Sets whether only local files can be selected in the
file selector. If `local_only` is `true` (the default),
then the selected file or files are guaranteed to be
accessible through the operating systems native file
system and therefore the application only
needs to worry about the filename functions in
`FileChooser`, like `FileChooser::get_filename`,
rather than the URI functions like
`FileChooser::get_uri`,

On some systems non-native files may still be
available using the native filesystem via a userspace
filesystem (FUSE).
## `local_only`
`true` if only local files can be selected
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_preview_widget -->
Sets an application-supplied widget to use to display a custom preview
of the currently selected file. To implement a preview, after setting the
preview widget, you connect to the `FileChooser::update-preview`
signal, and call `FileChooser::get_preview_filename` or
`FileChooser::get_preview_uri` on each change. If you can
display a preview of the new file, update your widget and
set the preview active using `FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active`.
Otherwise, set the preview inactive.

When there is no application-supplied preview widget, or the
application-supplied preview widget is not active, the file chooser
will display no preview at all.
## `preview_widget`
widget for displaying preview.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_preview_widget_active -->
Sets whether the preview widget set by
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget` should be shown for the
current filename. When `active` is set to false, the file chooser
may display an internally generated preview of the current file
or it may display no preview at all. See
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget` for more details.
## `active`
whether to display the user-specified preview widget
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_select_multiple -->
Sets whether multiple files can be selected in the file selector. This is
only relevant if the action is set to be `FileChooserAction::Open` or
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.
## `select_multiple`
`true` if multiple files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_show_hidden -->
Sets whether hidden files and folders are displayed in the file selector.
## `show_hidden`
`true` if hidden files and folders should be displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_uri -->
Sets the file referred to by `uri` as the current file for the file chooser,
by changing to the URI’s parent folder and actually selecting the URI in the
list. If the `self` is `FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the URI’s base
name will also appear in the dialog’s file name entry.

Note that the URI must exist, or nothing will be done except for the
directory change.

You should use this function only when implementing a save
dialog for which you already have a file name to which
the user may save. For example, when the user opens an existing file and then
does Save As... to save a copy or a
modified version. If you don’t have a file name already — for example,
if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the first time, do
not call this function. Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_uri (chooser, existing_uri);
  }
```


In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestions
as to where to save his new file. In the second case, the file’s existing location
is already known, so the file chooser will use it.
## `uri`
the URI to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_use_preview_label -->
Sets whether the file chooser should display a stock label with the name of
the file that is being previewed; the default is `true`. Applications that
want to draw the whole preview area themselves should set this to `false` and
display the name themselves in their preview widget.

See also: `FileChooser::set_preview_widget`
## `use_label`
whether to display a stock label with the name of the previewed file
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_all -->
Unselects all the files in the current folder of a file chooser.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_file -->
Unselects the file referred to by `file`. If the file is not in the current
directory, does not exist, or is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `file`
a `gio::File`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_filename -->
Unselects a currently selected filename. If the filename
is not in the current directory, does not exist, or
is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `filename`
the filename to unselect
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_uri -->
Unselects the file referred to by `uri`. If the file
is not in the current directory, does not exist, or
is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `uri`
the URI to unselect
<!-- enum FileChooserAction -->
Describes whether a `FileChooser` is being used to open existing files
or to save to a possibly new file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Open -->
Indicates open mode. The file chooser
 will only let the user pick an existing file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Save -->
Indicates save mode. The file chooser
 will let the user pick an existing file, or type in a new
 filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant SelectFolder -->
Indicates an Open mode for
 selecting folders. The file chooser will let the user pick an
 existing folder.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant CreateFolder -->
Indicates a mode for creating a
 new folder. The file chooser will let the user name an existing or
 new folder.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation -->
Used as a return value of handlers for the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal of a `FileChooser`. This
value determines whether the file chooser will present the stock
confirmation dialog, accept the user’s choice of a filename, or
let the user choose another filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant Confirm -->
The file chooser will present
 its stock dialog to confirm about overwriting an existing file.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant AcceptFilename -->
The file chooser will
 terminate and accept the user’s choice of a file name.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant SelectAgain -->
The file chooser will
 continue running, so as to let the user select another file name.
<!-- struct FileChooserDialog -->
`FileChooserDialog` is a dialog box suitable for use with
“File/Open” or “File/Save as” commands. This widget works by
putting a `FileChooserWidget` inside a `Dialog`. It exposes
the `FileChooser` interface, so you can use all of the
`FileChooser` functions on the file chooser dialog as well as
those for `Dialog`.

Note that `FileChooserDialog` does not have any methods of its
own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
`FileChooser`.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkfilechooser`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`FileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
gint res;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Open"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);

res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;
    GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    open_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooser *chooser;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
gint res;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Save"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);
chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation (chooser, TRUE);

if (user_edited_a_new_document)
  gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser,
                                     _("Untitled document"));
else
  gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser,
                                 existing_filename);

res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;

    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    save_to_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-setting-up}

There are various cases in which you may need to use a `FileChooserDialog`:

- To select a file for opening. Use `FileChooserAction::Open`.

- To save a file for the first time. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with `FileChooser::set_current_name`.

- To save a file under a different name. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and set the existing filename with `FileChooser::set_filename`.

- To choose a folder instead of a file. Use `FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.

Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
using `FileChooser::set_current_folder` in various
situations, with the intention of letting the application
suggest a reasonable default folder. This is no longer
considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
able to make good suggestions on its own. In general, you
should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
when it is appropriate to use `FileChooser::set_filename`,
i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
have a file saved somewhere.

## Response Codes ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-responses}

`FileChooserDialog` inherits from `Dialog`, so buttons that
go in its action area have response codes such as
`ResponseType::Accept` and `ResponseType::Cancel`. For example, you
could call `FileChooserDialog::new` as follows:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Open"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);
```

This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use stock
response identifiers from `ResponseType`. For most dialog
boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
ones in `ResponseType`, but `FileChooserDialog` assumes that
its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
will have one of the following response codes:

- `ResponseType::Accept`
- `ResponseType::Ok`
- `ResponseType::Yes`
- `ResponseType::Apply`

This is because `FileChooserDialog` must intercept responses
and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
appropriate.

To summarize, make sure you use a
[stock response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
when you use `FileChooserDialog` to ensure proper operation.

<!-- impl FileChooserDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileChooserDialog`. This function is analogous to
`Dialog::new_with_buttons`.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`
## `action`
Open or save mode for the dialog
## `first_button_text`
stock ID or text to go in the first button, or `None`

# Returns

<!-- enum FileChooserError -->
These identify the various errors that can occur while calling
`FileChooser` functions.
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant Nonexistent -->
Indicates that a file does not exist.
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant BadFilename -->
Indicates a malformed filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant AlreadyExists -->
Indicates a duplicate path (e.g. when
 adding a bookmark).
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant IncompleteHostname -->
Indicates an incomplete hostname (e.g. "http://foo" without a slash after that).
<!-- struct FileChooserWidget -->
`FileChooserWidget` is a widget for choosing files.
It exposes the `FileChooser` interface, and you should
use the methods of this interface to interact with the
widget.

<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileChooserWidget`. This is a file chooser widget that can
be embedded in custom windows, and it is the same widget that is used by
`FileChooserDialog`.
## `action`
Open or save mode for the widget

# Returns

a new `FileChooserWidget`
<!-- struct FileFilter -->
A `FileFilter` can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
`FileChooser`. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
`FileFilter::add_pattern`), on their mime type (with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`), or by a custom filter function
(with `FileFilter::add_custom`).

Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
text/plain. Note that `FileFilter` allows wildcards for the
subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.

Normally, filters are used by adding them to a `FileChooser`,
see `FileChooser::add_filter`, but it is also possible
to manually use a filter on a file with `FileFilter::filter`.

# `FileFilter` as `Buildable`

The `FileFilter` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>`, `<patterns>` and
`<applications>` elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
a `<mime-type>` or `<pattern>` has the same effect as as calling
`FileFilter::add_mime_type` or `FileFilter::add_pattern`.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying `FileFilter`
rules:

```text
<object class="GtkFileFilter">
  <mime-types>
    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
    <mime-type>image/ *</mime-type>
  </mime-types>
  <patterns>
    <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
    <pattern>*.png</pattern>
  </patterns>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileFilter` with no rules added to it.
Such a filter doesn’t accept any files, so is not
particularly useful until you add rules with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`, `FileFilter::add_pattern`,
or `FileFilter::add_custom`. To create a filter
that accepts any file, use:

```C
GtkFileFilter *filter = gtk_file_filter_new ();
gtk_file_filter_add_pattern (filter, "*");
```

# Returns

a new `FileFilter`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_custom -->
Adds rule to a filter that allows files based on a custom callback
function. The bitfield `needed` which is passed in provides information
about what sorts of information that the filter function needs;
this allows GTK+ to avoid retrieving expensive information when
it isn’t needed by the filter.
## `needed`
bitfield of flags indicating the information that the custom
 filter function needs.
## `func`
callback function; if the function returns `true`, then
 the file will be displayed.
## `data`
data to pass to `func`
## `notify`
function to call to free `data` when it is no longer needed.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_mime_type -->
Adds a rule allowing a given mime type to `self`.
## `mime_type`
name of a MIME type
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pattern -->
Adds a rule allowing a shell style glob to a filter.
## `pattern`
a shell style glob
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pixbuf_formats -->
Adds a rule allowing image files in the formats supported
by `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn filter -->
Tests whether a file should be displayed according to `self`.
The `FileFilterInfo` `filter_info` should include
the fields returned from `FileFilter::get_needed`.

This function will not typically be used by applications; it
is intended principally for use in the implementation of
`FileChooser`.
## `filter_info`
a `FileFilterInfo` containing information
 about a file.

# Returns

`true` if the file should be displayed
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_name -->
Gets the human-readable name for the filter. See `FileFilter::set_name`.

# Returns

The human-readable name of the filter,
 or `None`. This value is owned by GTK+ and must not
 be modified or freed.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_needed -->
Gets the fields that need to be filled in for the `FileFilterInfo`
passed to `FileFilter::filter`

This function will not typically be used by applications; it
is intended principally for use in the implementation of
`FileChooser`.

# Returns

bitfield of flags indicating needed fields when
 calling `FileFilter::filter`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn set_name -->
Sets the human-readable name of the filter; this is the string
that will be displayed in the file selector user interface if
there is a selectable list of filters.
## `name`
the human-readable-name for the filter, or `None`
 to remove any existing name.
<!-- struct Fixed -->
The `Fixed` widget is a container which can place child widgets
at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. `Fixed`
performs no automatic layout management.

For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
results in broken applications. With `Fixed`, the following
things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
other display bugs:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 default, or they may be using Windows or the framebuffer port of
 GTK+, where different fonts are available.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 cases.

In addition, the fixed widget can’t properly be mirrored in
right-to-left languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. i.e. normally
GTK+ will flip the interface to put labels to the right of the
thing they label, but it can’t do that with `Fixed`. So your
application will not be usable in right-to-left languages.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
application.

If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
and prefer the simplicity of `Fixed`, by all means use the
widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.

# Implements

<!-- impl Fixed::fn put -->
Adds a widget to a `Fixed` container at the given position.
## `widget`
the widget to add.
## `x`
the horizontal position to place the widget at.
## `y`
the vertical position to place the widget at.
<!-- struct FlowBox -->
A `FlowBox` positions child widgets in sequence according to its
orientation.

For instance, with the horizontal orientation, the widgets will be
arranged from left to right, starting a new row under the previous
row when necessary. Reducing the width in this case will require more
rows, so a larger height will be requested.

Likewise, with the vertical orientation, the widgets will be arranged
from top to bottom, starting a new column to the right when necessary.
Reducing the height will require more columns, so a larger width will
be requested.

The children of a `FlowBox` can be dynamically sorted and filtered.

Although a `FlowBox` must have only `FlowBoxChild` children,
you can add any kind of widget to it via `ContainerExt::add`, and
a `FlowBoxChild` widget will automatically be inserted between
the box and the widget.

Also see `ListBox`.

`FlowBox` was added in GTK+ 3.12.

# Implements

[`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl FlowBoxChild::fn new -->
Creates a new `FlowBoxChild`, to be used as a child
of a `FlowBox`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

a new `FlowBoxChild`
<!-- impl FlowBoxChild::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting and filtering.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the sorting and filtering functions. For instance, if
the list is mirroring some external data set, and *two* children
changed in the external data set when you call
`FlowBoxChild::changed` on the first child, the sort function
must only read the new data for the first of the two changed
children, otherwise the resorting of the children will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model, you have to duplicate the data that affects the sorting
and filtering functions into the widgets themselves. Another
alternative is to call `FlowBox::invalidate_sort` on any
model change, but that is more expensive.

<!-- struct Frame -->
The frame widget is a Bin that surrounds its child
with a decorative frame and an optional label.
If present, the label is drawn in a gap in the
top side of the frame. The position of the
label can be controlled with `FrameExt::set_label_align`.

# `Frame` as `Buildable`

The `Frame` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can
be specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Frame`:

```text
<object class="GtkFrame">
  <child type="label">
    <object class="GtkLabel" id="frame-label"/>
  </child>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkEntry" id="frame-content"/>
  </child>
</object>
```

<!-- struct GLArea -->
`GLArea` is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL.

`GLArea` sets up its own `gdk::GLContext` for the window it creates, and
creates a custom GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto.
It also ensures that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target
when rendering.

In order to draw, you have to connect to the `GLArea::render` signal,
or subclass `GLArea` and override the `GLAreaClass.render`() virtual
function.

The `GLArea` widget ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` is associated with
the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
position of the drawing area changes.

## Drawing with `GLArea` ##

The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a `GLArea` is to
create a widget instance and connect to the `GLArea::render` signal:


```C
  // create a GtkGLArea instance
  GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();

  // connect to the "render" signal
  g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
```

The `render()` function will be called when the `GLArea` is ready
for you to draw its content:


```C
  static gboolean
  render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
  {
    // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
    // #GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
    // surface used by the #GtkGLArea and the viewport has
    // already been set to be the size of the allocation

    // we can start by clearing the buffer
    glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
    glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // draw your object
    draw_an_object ();

    // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
    // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
    // the buffers will be drawn on the window
    return TRUE;
  }
```

If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
shaders, you should use the `Widget::realize` signal; you
can use the `Widget::unrealize` signal to clean up. Since the
`gdk::GLContext` creation and initialization may fail, you will
need to check for errors, using `GLArea::get_error`. An example
of how to safely initialize the GL state is:


```C
  static void
  on_realize (GtkGLarea *area)
  {
    // We need to make the context current if we want to
    // call GL API
    gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);

    // If there were errors during the initialization or
    // when trying to make the context current, this
    // function will return a #GError for you to catch
    if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
      return;

    // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order
    // to show eventual initialization errors on the
    // GtkGLArea widget itself
    GError *internal_error = NULL;
    init_buffer_objects (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }

    init_shaders (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }
  }
```

If you need to change the options for creating the `gdk::GLContext`
you should use the `GLArea::create-context` signal.

<!-- impl GLArea::fn make_current -->
Ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` used by `self` is associated with
the `GLArea`.

This function is automatically called before emitting the
`GLArea::render` signal, and doesn't normally need to be called
by application code.

Feature: `v3_16`

<!-- impl GLArea::fn queue_render -->
Marks the currently rendered data (if any) as invalid, and queues
a redraw of the widget, ensuring that the `GLArea::render` signal
is emitted during the draw.

This is only needed when the `GLArea::set_auto_render` has
been called with a `false` value. The default behaviour is to
emit `GLArea::render` on each draw.

Feature: `v3_16`

<!-- impl GLArea::fn set_auto_render -->
If `auto_render` is `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be
emitted every time the widget draws. This is the default and is
useful if drawing the widget is faster.

If `auto_render` is `false` the data from previous rendering is kept
around and will be used for drawing the widget the next time,
unless the window is resized. In order to force a rendering
`GLArea::queue_render` must be called. This mode is useful when
the scene changes seldomly, but takes a long time to redraw.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `auto_render`
a boolean

<!-- impl GLArea::fn set_has_alpha -->
If `has_alpha` is `true` the buffer allocated by the widget will have
an alpha channel component, and when rendering to the window the
result will be composited over whatever is below the widget.

buffer will fully replace anything below the widget.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `has_alpha`
`true` to add an alpha component
<!-- impl GLArea::fn set_has_depth_buffer -->
If `has_depth_buffer` is `true` the widget will allocate and

there will be none.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `has_depth_buffer`
`true` to add a depth buffer
<!-- impl GLArea::fn set_has_stencil_buffer -->

<!-- struct Gesture -->
`Gesture` is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
the special `None` `gdk::EventSequence` value for these).

The number of touches that a `Gesture` need to be recognized is controlled
by the `Gesture:n-points` property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
is recognized.

As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
run the `Gesture::check` signal regularly on input events until the gesture
is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
`Gesture` subclasses.

A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
- `Gesture::begin` when the gesture is recognized.
- A number of `Gesture::update`, whenever an input event is processed.
- `Gesture::end` when the gesture is no longer recognized.

## Event propagation

In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
through `EventControllerExt::set_propagation_phase`, or feed those manually
through `EventControllerExt::handle_event`.

In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.

After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional `Widget::button-press`,
`Widget::button-release`, `Widget::touch-event`, etc signals. Gestures
with the `PropagationPhase::Target` phase are fed events from the default `Widget::event`
handlers.

In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.

## States of a sequence # {`touch`-sequence-states}

Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
``GtkGestures``, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the ``GdkEventSequences``
triggering those.

Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through `GestureExt::group`,
grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
`GestureExt::set_sequence_state` on one will effectively propagate
the state throughout the group.

By default, all sequences start out in the `EventSequenceState::None` state,
sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.

If a sequence enters into the `EventSequenceState::Denied` state, the gesture
group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
the touch is active.

If a sequence enters in the `EventSequenceState::Claimed` state, the gesture
group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
- Setting the same sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied` on every other gesture
 group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
 chain.
- calling `Gesture::cancel` on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
 propagation chain.
- Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.

Note: if a sequence is set early to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on
`gdk::EventType::TouchBegin`/`gdk::EventType::ButtonPress` (so those events are captured before
reaching the event widget, this implies `PropagationPhase::Capture`), one similar
event will emulated if the sequence changes to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.
This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
again.

Sequence states can't be changed freely, see `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`
to know about the possible lifetimes of a `gdk::EventSequence`.

<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_last_updated_sequence -->
Returns the `gdk::EventSequence` that was last updated on `self`.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

The last updated sequence
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_point -->
If `sequence` is currently being interpreted by `self`, this
function returns `true` and fills in `x` and `y` with the last coordinates
stored for that event sequence. The coordinates are always relative to the
widget allocation.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- trait GestureExt::fn group -->
Adds `gesture` to the same group than `self`. Gestures
are by default isolated in their own groups.

When gestures are grouped, the state of ``GdkEventSequences``
is kept in sync for all of those, so calling `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`,
on one will transfer the same value to the others.

Groups also perform an "implicit grabbing" of sequences, if a
`gdk::EventSequence` state is set to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on one group,
every other gesture group attached to the same `Widget` will switch the
state for that sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `gesture`
a `Gesture`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn handles_sequence -->
Returns `true` if `self` is currently handling events corresponding to
`sequence`.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_recognized -->
Returns `true` if the gesture is currently recognized.
A gesture is recognized if there are as many interacting
touch sequences as required by `self`, and `Gesture::check`
returned `true` for the sequences being currently interpreted.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

`true` if gesture is recognized
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_sequence_state -->
Sets the state of `sequence` in `self`. Sequences start
in state `EventSequenceState::None`, and whenever they change
state, they can never go back to that state. Likewise,
sequences in state `EventSequenceState::Denied` cannot turn
back to a not denied state. With these rules, the lifetime
of an event sequence is constrained to the next four:

* None
* None → Denied
* None → Claimed
* None → Claimed → Denied

Note: Due to event handling ordering, it may be unsafe to
set the state on another gesture within a `Gesture::begin`
signal handler, as the callback might be executed before
the other gesture knows about the sequence. A safe way to
perform this could be:


```text
static void
first_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *first_gesture,
                        GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                        gpointer          user_data)
{
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_ACCEPTED);
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}

static void
second_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *second_gesture,
                         GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                         gpointer          user_data)
{
  if (gtk_gesture_get_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence) == GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_ACCEPTED)
    gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}
```

If both gestures are in the same group, just set the state on
the gesture emitting the event, the sequence will be already
be initialized to the group's global state when the second
gesture processes the event.

<!-- struct GestureLongPress -->
`GestureLongPress` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
long presses, triggering the `GestureLongPress::pressed` after the
timeout is exceeded.

If the touchpoint is lifted before the timeout passes, or if it drifts
too far of the initial press point, the `GestureLongPress::cancelled`
signal will be emitted.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- struct GestureMultiPress -->
`GestureMultiPress` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
multiple clicks on a nearby zone, which can be listened for through the
`GestureMultiPress::pressed` signal. Whenever time or distance between
clicks exceed the GTK+ defaults, `GestureMultiPress::stopped` is emitted,
and the click counter is reset.

Callers may also restrict the area that is considered valid for a >1
touch/button press through `GestureMultiPress::set_area`, so any
click happening outside that area is considered to be a first click of
its own.

Feature: `v3_14`

details on what the press area represents.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `rect`
return location for the press area

# Returns

`true` if `rect` was filled with the press area
<!-- impl GestureMultiPress::fn set_area -->
If `rect` is non-`None`, the press area will be checked to be
confined within the rectangle, otherwise the button count
will be reset so the press is seen as being the first one.
If `rect` is `None`, the area will be reset to an unrestricted
state.

Note: The rectangle is only used to determine whether any
non-first click falls within the expected area. This is not
akin to an input shape.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `rect`
rectangle to receive coordinates on
<!-- struct GesturePan -->
`GesturePan` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
pan gestures, those are drags that are locked to happen along one
axis. The axis that a `GesturePan` handles is defined at
construct time, and can be changed through
`GesturePan::set_orientation`.

When the gesture starts to be recognized, `GesturePan` will
attempt to determine as early as possible whether the sequence
is moving in the expected direction, and denying the sequence if
this does not happen.

Once a panning gesture along the expected axis is recognized,
the `GesturePan::pan` signal will be emitted as input events
are received, containing the offset in the given axis.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- struct GestureSingle -->
`GestureSingle` is a subclass of `Gesture`, optimized (although
not restricted) for dealing with mouse and single-touch gestures. Under
interaction, these gestures stick to the first interacting sequence, which
is accessible through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_sequence` while the
gesture is being interacted with.

By default gestures react to both `GDK_BUTTON_PRIMARY` and touch
events, `GestureSingleExt::set_touch_only` can be used to change the
touch behavior. Callers may also specify a different mouse button number
to interact with through `GestureSingleExt::set_button`, or react to any
mouse button by setting 0. While the gesture is active, the button being
currently pressed can be known through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_button`.

Feature: `v3_14`

Touch events implicitly match with button 1.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `button`
button number to listen to, or 0 for any button
<!-- trait GestureSingleExt::fn set_exclusive -->
Sets whether `self` is exclusive. An exclusive gesture will
only handle pointer and "pointer emulated" touch events, so at
any given time, there is only one sequence able to interact with
those.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `exclusive`
`true` to make `self` exclusive
<!-- trait GestureSingleExt::fn set_touch_only -->
If `touch_only` is `true`, `self` will only handle events of type
`gdk::EventType::TouchBegin`, `gdk::EventType::TouchUpdate` or `gdk::EventType::TouchEnd`. If `false`,
mouse events will be handled too.

<!-- struct Grid -->
`Grid` is a container which arranges its child widgets in
rows and columns. It is a very similar to `Table` and `Box`,
but it consistently uses `Widget`’s `Widget:margin` and `Widget:expand`
properties instead of custom child properties, and it fully supports
[height-for-width geometry management][geometry-management].

Children are added using `Grid::attach`. They can span multiple
rows or columns. It is also possible to add a child next to an
existing child, using `Grid::attach_next_to`. The behaviour of
`Grid` when several children occupy the same grid cell is undefined.

`Grid` can be used like a `Box` by just using `ContainerExt::add`,
which will place children next to each other in the direction determined
by the `Orientable:orientation` property.

`HeaderBar` is similar to a horizontal `Box`. It allows children to
be placed at the start or the end. In addition, it allows a title and
subtitle to be displayed. The title will be centered with respect to
the width of the box, even if the children at either side take up
different amounts of space. The height of the titlebar will be
set to provide sufficient space for the subtitle, even if none is
currently set. If a subtitle is not needed, the space reservation
can be turned off with `HeaderBar::set_has_subtitle`.

`HeaderBar` can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize,
maximize and close buttons, or the window icon.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_custom_title -->
Sets a custom title for the `HeaderBar`.

The title should help a user identify the current view. This
supersedes any title set by `HeaderBar::set_title` or
`HeaderBar::set_subtitle`. To achieve the same style as
the builtin title and subtitle, use the “title” and “subtitle”
style classes.

You should set the custom title to `None`, for the header title
label to be visible again.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `title_widget`
a custom widget to use for a title
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_decoration_layout -->
Sets the decoration layout for this header bar, overriding
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting.

There can be valid reasons for overriding the setting, such
as a header bar design that does not allow for buttons to take
room on the right, or only offers room for a single close button.
Split header bars are another example for overriding the
setting.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close, icon (the window icon) and menu (a menu button
for the fallback app menu).

For example, “menu:minimize,maximize,close” specifies a menu
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `layout`
a decoration layout, or `None` to
 unset the layout
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_has_subtitle -->
Sets whether the header bar should reserve space
for a subtitle, even if none is currently set.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `setting`
`true` to reserve space for a subtitle
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_show_close_button -->
Sets whether this header bar shows the standard window decorations,
including close, maximize, and minimize.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `setting`
`true` to show standard widow decorations
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_subtitle -->
Sets the subtitle of the `HeaderBar`. The title should give a user
an additional detail to help him identify the current view.

Note that `HeaderBar` by default reserves room for the subtitle,
even if none is currently set. If this is not desired, set the
`HeaderBar:has-subtitle` property to `false`.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `subtitle`
a subtitle, or `None`
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `HeaderBar`. The title should help a user
identify the current view. A good title should not include the
application name.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `title`
a title, or `None`

`IconView` provides an alternative view on a `TreeModel`.
It displays the model as a grid of icons with labels. Like
`TreeView`, it allows to select one or multiple items
(depending on the selection mode, see `IconView::set_selection_mode`).
In addition to selection with the arrow keys, `IconView` supports
rubberband selection, which is controlled by dragging the pointer.

Note that if the tree model is backed by an actual tree store (as
opposed to a flat list where the mapping to icons is obvious),
`IconView` will only display the first level of the tree and
ignore the tree’s branches.

used, or -1 if this is disabled.
<!-- impl IconView::fn get_tooltip_context -->
This function is supposed to be used in a `Widget::query-tooltip`
signal handler for `IconView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is an icon view item at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the item returned will be the cursor item. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model. `x` and `y` will always be converted
to be relative to `self`’s bin_window if `keyboard_tooltip` is `false`.
## `x`
the x coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `y`
the y coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `keyboard_tip`
whether this is a keyboard tooltip or not
## `model`
a pointer to receive a
 `TreeModel` or `None`
## `path`
a pointer to receive a `TreePath` or `None`
## `iter`
a pointer to receive a `TreeIter` or `None`

# Returns

Note that there may be invisible paths in between.

Both paths should be freed with `TreePath::free` after use.
## `start_path`
Return location for start of region,
 or `None`
## `end_path`
Return location for end of region, or `None`

# Returns

`true`, if valid paths were placed in `start_path` and `end_path`
<!-- impl IconView::fn item_activated -->
Activates the item determined by `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be activated
<!-- impl IconView::fn path_is_selected -->
Returns `true` if the icon pointed to by `path` is currently
selected. If `path` does not point to a valid location, `false` is returned.
## `path`
A `TreePath` to check selection on.

# Returns

`true` if `path` is selected.
<!-- impl IconView::fn scroll_to_path -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `path`.
`row_align` determines where the row is placed, and `col_align` determines
where `column` is placed. Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means
center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.
This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on
the model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the
centered path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the item to move to.
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments, or `false`.
## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the item specified by `path`.
## `col_align`

<!-- impl IconView::fn select_all -->
Selects all the icons. `self` must has its selection mode set
to `SelectionMode::Multiple`.
<!-- impl IconView::fn select_path -->
Selects the row at `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be selected.
<!-- impl IconView::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected icon. Note that the model or
selection cannot be modified from within this function.
## `func`
The function to call for each selected icon.
## `data`
User data to pass to the function.
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->

a single click instead of a double click.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `single`
`true` to emit item-activated on a single click
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_column_spacing -->
Sets the ::column-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the columns of the icon view.
## `column_spacing`
the column spacing
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_columns -->
Sets the ::columns property which determines in how
many columns the icons are arranged. If `columns` is
-1, the number of columns will be chosen automatically
to fill the available area.
## `columns`
the number of columns
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular item.
If `cell` is not `None`, then focus is given to the cell specified by
it. Additionally, if `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be
started in the specified cell.

This function is often followed by `gtk_widget_grab_focus
(icon_view)` in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.
Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `cell`
One of the cell renderers of `self`, or `None`
## `start_editing`
`true` if the specified cell should start being edited.

<!-- impl IconView::fn set_item_padding -->
Sets the `IconView:item-padding` property which specifies the padding
around each of the icon view’s items.
## `item_padding`
the item padding
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_item_width -->
Sets the ::item-width property which specifies the width
to use for each item. If it is set to -1, the icon view will
automatically determine a suitable item size.
## `item_width`
the width for each item
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_margin -->
Sets the ::margin property which specifies the space
which is inserted at the top, bottom, left and right
of the icon view.
## `margin`
the margin
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_markup_column -->
Sets the column with markup information for `self` to be
`column`. The markup column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.
If the markup column is set to something, it overrides
the text column set by `IconView::set_text_column`.
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `IconView`.
If the `self` already has a model set, it will remove
it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`, then
it will unset the old model.
## `model`
The model.
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_pixbuf_column -->
Sets the column with pixbufs for `self` to be `column`. The pixbuf
column must be of type `GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF`
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to disable
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models that
support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the `TreeDragDestIface`. Both
`TreeStore` and `ListStore` support these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then
the user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows. The
developer can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's
row_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting up
the icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag and
drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the list of items can be reordered.
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_row_spacing -->
Sets the ::row-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the rows of the icon view.
## `row_spacing`
the row spacing
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_selection_mode -->
Sets the selection mode of the `self`.
## `mode`
The selection mode
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_spacing -->
Sets the ::spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the cells (i.e. the icon and
the text) of an item.
## `spacing`
the spacing
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_text_column -->
Sets the column with text for `self` to be `column`. The text
column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_cell -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area which `cell` occupies in
the item pointed to by `path`. See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.

See also `IconView::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full items, you
can use this function to have `IconView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_item -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the item at `path`.
See also `IconView::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath`
<!-- impl IconView::fn unselect_all -->
Unselects all the icons.
<!-- impl IconView::fn unselect_path -->
Unselects the row at `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be unselected.
<!-- impl IconView::fn unset_model_drag_dest -->
Undoes the effect of `IconView::enable_model_drag_dest`. Calling this
method sets `IconView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- impl IconView::fn unset_model_drag_source -->
Undoes the effect of `IconView::enable_model_drag_source`. Calling this
method sets `IconView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition -->
An enum for determining where a dropped item goes.
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant NoDrop -->
no drop possible
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant DropInto -->
dropped item replaces the item
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant DropLeft -->
droppped item is inserted to the left
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant DropRight -->
dropped item is inserted to the right
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant DropAbove -->
dropped item is inserted above
<!-- enum IconViewDropPosition::variant DropBelow -->
dropped item is inserted below
<!-- struct Image -->
The `Image` widget displays an image. Various kinds of object
can be displayed as an image; most typically, you would load a
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` ("pixel buffer") from a file, and then display that.
There’s a convenience function to do this, `Image::new_from_file`,
used as follows:

```C
  GtkWidget *image;
  image = gtk_image_new_from_file ("myfile.png");
```
If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a
“broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_file`, then create the `Image` with
`Image::new_from_pixbuf`.

The image file may contain an animation, if so the `Image` will
display an animation (`gdk_pixbuf::PixbufAnimation`) instead of a static image.

`Image` is a subclass of `Misc`, which implies that you can
align it (center, left, right) and add padding to it, using
`Misc` methods.

`Image` is a “no window” widget (has no `gdk::Window` of its own),
so by default does not receive events. If you want to receive events
on the image, such as button clicks, place the image inside a
`EventBox`, then connect to the event signals on the event box.

## Handling button press events on a `Image`.


```C
  static gboolean
  button_press_callback (GtkWidget      *event_box,
                         GdkEventButton *event,
                         gpointer        data)
  {
    g_print ("Event box clicked at coordinates %f,%f\n",
             event->x, event->y);

    // Returning TRUE means we handled the event, so the signal
    // emission should be stopped (don’t call any further callbacks
    // that may be connected). Return FALSE to continue invoking callbacks.
    return TRUE;
  }

  static GtkWidget*
  create_image (void)
  {
    GtkWidget *image;
    GtkWidget *event_box;

    image = gtk_image_new_from_file ("myfile.png");

    event_box = gtk_event_box_new ();

    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (event_box), image);

    g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (event_box),
                      "button_press_event",
                      G_CALLBACK (button_press_callback),
                      image);

    return image;
  }
```

When handling events on the event box, keep in mind that coordinates
in the image may be different from event box coordinates due to
the alignment and padding settings on the image (see `Misc`).
The simplest way to solve this is to set the alignment to 0.0
(left/top), and set the padding to zero. Then the origin of
the image will be the same as the origin of the event box.

Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
files, such as image files. GTK+ comes with a program to avoid this,
called “gdk-pixbuf-csource”. This library
allows you to convert an image into a C variable declaration, which
can then be loaded into a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` using
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_inline`.

# Implements

[`MiscExt`](trait.MiscExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Image::fn new -->
Creates a new empty `Image` widget.

# Returns

a newly created `Image` widget.
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_animation -->
Creates a `Image` displaying the given animation.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the
animation; you still need to unref it if you own references.
`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

Note that the animation frames are shown using a timeout with
`G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`. When using animations to indicate busyness,
keep in mind that the animation will only be shown if the main loop
is not busy with something that has a higher priority.
## `animation`
an animation

# Returns

a new `Image` widget
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_file -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the file `filename`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will
display a “broken image” icon. This function never returns `None`,
it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If the file contains an animation, the image will contain an
animation.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the pixbuf. (Or for animations, use
`gdk_pixbuf::PixbufAnimation::new_from_file`).

The storage type (`Image::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.
## `filename`
a filename

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_gicon -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be
displayed instead. If the current icon theme is changed, the icon
will be updated appropriately.
## `icon`
an icon
## `size`
a stock icon size

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_icon_name -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be
displayed instead. If the current icon theme is changed, the icon
will be updated appropriately.
## `icon_name`
an icon name
## `size`
a stock icon size

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_icon_set -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon set. Sample stock sizes are
`IconSize::Menu`, `IconSize::SmallToolbar`. Instead of using
this function, usually it’s better to create a `IconFactory`, put
your icon sets in the icon factory, add the icon factory to the
list of default factories with `IconFactory::add_default`, and
then use `Image::new_from_stock`. This will allow themes to
override the icon you ship with your application.

The `Image` does not assume a reference to the
icon set; you still need to unref it if you own references.
`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `Image::new_from_icon_name` instead.
## `icon_set`
a `IconSet`
## `size`
a stock icon size

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_pixbuf -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying `pixbuf`.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the
pixbuf; you still need to unref it if you own references.
`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

Note that this function just creates an `Image` from the pixbuf. The
`Image` created will not react to state changes. Should you want that,
you should use `Image::new_from_icon_name`.
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_resource -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the resource file `resource_path`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will
display a “broken image” icon. This function never returns `None`,
it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If the file contains an animation, the image will contain an
animation.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the pixbuf. (Or for animations, use
`gdk_pixbuf::PixbufAnimation::new_from_file`).

The storage type (`Image::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.
## `resource_path`
a resource path

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_stock -->
Creates a `Image` displaying a stock icon. Sample stock icon
names are `GTK_STOCK_OPEN`, `GTK_STOCK_QUIT`. Sample stock sizes
are `IconSize::Menu`, `IconSize::SmallToolbar`. If the stock
icon name isn’t known, the image will be empty.
You can register your own stock icon names, see
`IconFactory::add_default` and `IconFactory::add`.

<!-- struct ImageMenuItem -->
`[Deprecated since 3.10]` A `ImageMenuItem` is a menu item which has an icon next to the text label.

This is functionally equivalent to:


```C
  GtkWidget *box = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, 6);
  GtkWidget *icon = gtk_image_new_from_icon_name ("folder-music-symbolic", GTK_ICON_SIZE_MENU);
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new ("Music");
  GtkWidget *menu_item = gtk_menu_item_new ();

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), icon);
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), label);

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (menu_item), box);

  gtk_widget_show_all (menu_item);
```

Note that the user may disable display of menu icons using
the `Settings:gtk-menu-images` setting, so make sure to still
fill in the text label. If you want to ensure that your menu items
show an icon you are strongly encouraged to use a `MenuItem`
with a `Image` instead.

`ImageMenuItem` has been deprecated since GTK+ 3.10. If you want to
display an icon in a menu item, you should use `MenuItem` and pack a
`Box` with a `Image` and a `Label` instead. You should also consider
using `Builder` and the XML `gio::Menu` description for creating menus, by
following the [GMenu guide][https://developer.gnome.org/GMenu/]. You should
consider using icons in menu items only sparingly, and for "objects" (or
"nouns") elements only, like bookmarks, files, and links; "actions" (or
"verbs") should not have icons.

Use `MenuItem::new` instead.

# Returns

a new `ImageMenuItem`
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn new_from_stock -->
Creates a new `ImageMenuItem` containing the image and text from a
stock item. Some stock ids have preprocessor macros like `GTK_STOCK_OK`
and `GTK_STOCK_APPLY`.

If you want this menu item to have changeable accelerators, then pass in
`None` for accel_group. Next call `MenuItem::set_accel_path` with an
appropriate path for the menu item, use `gtk_stock_lookup` to look up the
standard accelerator for the stock item, and if one is found, call
`AccelMap::add_entry` to register it.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `MenuItem::new` instead.
## `stock_id`
the name of the stock item.
## `accel_group`
the `AccelGroup` to add the menu items
 accelerator to, or `None`.

# Returns

a new `ImageMenuItem`.

## `label`
the text of the menu item.

# Returns

a new `ImageMenuItem`.
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `ImageMenuItem` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the menu item.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `MenuItem::new_with_mnemonic` instead.
## `label`
the text of the menu item, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `ImageMenuItem`
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn get_always_show_image -->

# Returns

`true` if the label set in the menuitem is used as a
 stock id to select the stock item for the item
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn set_accel_group -->
Specifies an `accel_group` to add the menu items accelerator to
(this only applies to stock items so a stock item must already
be set, make sure to call `ImageMenuItem::set_use_stock`
and `MenuItem::set_label` with a valid stock item first).

If you want this menu item to have changeable accelerators then
you shouldnt need this (see `ImageMenuItem::new_from_stock`).

# Deprecated since 3.10

## `accel_group`
the `AccelGroup`
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn set_always_show_image -->
If `true`, the menu item will ignore the `Settings:gtk-menu-images`
setting and always show the image, if available.

Use this property if the menuitem would be useless or hard to use
without the image.

# Deprecated since 3.10

## `always_show`
`true` if the menuitem should always show the image
<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn set_image -->

<!-- impl ImageMenuItem::fn set_use_stock -->
If `true`, the label set in the menuitem is used as a
stock id to select the stock item for the item.

# Deprecated since 3.10

## `use_stock`

<!-- enum ImageType -->
Describes the image data representation used by a `Image`. If you
want to get the image from the widget, you can only get the
currently-stored representation. e.g. if the
`Image::get_storage_type` returns `ImageType::Pixbuf`, then you can
call `Image::get_pixbuf` but not `Image::get_stock`. For empty
images, you can request any storage type (call any of the "get"
functions), but they will all return `None` values.
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Empty -->
there is no image displayed by the widget
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Pixbuf -->
the widget contains a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Stock -->
the widget contains a [stock item name][gtkstock]
<!-- enum ImageType::variant IconSet -->
the widget contains a `IconSet`
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Animation -->
the widget contains a `gdk_pixbuf::PixbufAnimation`
<!-- enum ImageType::variant IconName -->
the widget contains a named icon.
 This image type was added in GTK+ 2.6
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Gicon -->
the widget contains a `gio::Icon`.
 This image type was added in GTK+ 2.14
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Surface -->
the widget contains a `cairo::Surface`.
 This image type was added in GTK+ 3.10
<!-- struct InfoBar -->
`InfoBar` is a widget that can be used to show messages to
the user without showing a dialog. It is often temporarily shown
at the top or bottom of a document. In contrast to `Dialog`, which
has a action area at the bottom, `InfoBar` has an action area
at the side.

The API of `InfoBar` is very similar to `Dialog`, allowing you
to add buttons to the action area with `InfoBar::add_button` or
`InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. The sensitivity of action widgets
can be controlled with `InfoBar::set_response_sensitive`.
To add widgets to the main content area of a `InfoBar`, use
`InfoBar::get_content_area` and add your widgets to the container.

Similar to `MessageDialog`, the contents of a `InfoBar` can by
classified as error message, warning, informational message, etc,
by using `InfoBar::set_message_type`. GTK+ may use the message type
to determine how the message is displayed.

A simple example for using a `InfoBar`:

```C
// set up info bar
GtkWidget *widget;
GtkInfoBar *bar;

widget = gtk_info_bar_new ();
bar = GTK_INFO_BAR (bar);

gtk_widget_set_no_show_all (widget, TRUE);
message_label = gtk_label_new ("");
gtk_widget_show (message_label);
content_area = gtk_info_bar_get_content_area (bar);
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (content_area),
                   message_label);
gtk_info_bar_add_button (bar,
                         _("_OK"),
                         GTK_RESPONSE_OK);
g_signal_connect (bar,
                  "response",
                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_hide),
                  NULL);
gtk_grid_attach (GTK_GRID (grid),
                 widget,
                 0, 2, 1, 1);

...

// show an error message
gtk_label_set_text (GTK_LABEL (message_label), message);
gtk_info_bar_set_message_type (bar,
                               GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR);
gtk_widget_show (bar);
```

# `InfoBar` as `Buildable`

The `InfoBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes
the content area and action area as internal children with the names
“content_area” and “action_area”.

`InfoBar` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`).

# Implements

[`BoxExt`](trait.BoxExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` object.

# Returns

a new `InfoBar` object
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` with buttons. Button text/response ID
pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending the list.
Button text can be either a stock ID such as `GTK_STOCK_OK`, or
some arbitrary text. A response ID can be any positive number,
or one of the values in the `ResponseType` enumeration. If the
user clicks one of these dialog buttons, `InfoBar` will emit
the “response” signal with the corresponding response ID.
## `first_button_text`
stock ID or text to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `InfoBar`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_action_widget -->
Add an activatable widget to the action area of a `InfoBar`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `InfoBar::response`
signal on the message area when the widget is activated. The widget
is appended to the end of the message areas action area.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the “response” signal with the given
response_id. The button is appended to the end of the info bars's
action area. The button widget is returned, but usually you don't
need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget
that was added
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `InfoBar::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text or stock ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_action_area -->
Returns the action area of `self`.

# Returns

the action area
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_content_area -->
Returns the content area of `self`.

# Returns

the content area
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_message_type -->
Returns the message type of the message area.

# Returns

the message type of the message area.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_show_close_button -->
Returns whether the widget will display a standard close button.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

`true` if the widget displays standard close button
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn response -->
Emits the “response” signal with the given `response_id`.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_default_response -->
Sets the last widget in the info bar’s action area with
the given response_id as the default widget for the dialog.
Pressing “Enter” normally activates the default widget.

Note that this function currently requires `self` to
be added to a widget hierarchy.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_message_type -->
Sets the message type of the message area.
GTK+ uses this type to determine what color to use
when drawing the message area.
## `message_type`
a `MessageType`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_response_sensitive -->
Calls gtk_widget_set_sensitive (widget, setting) for each
widget in the info bars’s action area with the given response_id.
A convenient way to sensitize/desensitize dialog buttons.
## `response_id`
a response ID
## `setting`
TRUE for sensitive
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_show_close_button -->
If true, a standard close button is shown. When clicked it emits
the response `ResponseType::Close`.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `setting`
`true` to include a close button
<!-- enum InputPurpose -->
Describes primary purpose of the input widget. This information is
useful for on-screen keyboards and similar input methods to decide
which keys should be presented to the user.

Note that the purpose is not meant to impose a totally strict rule
about allowed characters, and does not replace input validation.
It is fine for an on-screen keyboard to let the user override the
character set restriction that is expressed by the purpose. The
application is expected to validate the entry contents, even if
it specified a purpose.

The difference between `InputPurpose::Digits` and
`InputPurpose::Number` is that the former accepts only digits
while the latter also some punctuation (like commas or points, plus,
minus) and “e” or “E” as in 3.14E+000.

This enumeration may be extended in the future; input methods should
interpret unknown values as “free form”.
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant FreeForm -->
Allow any character
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Alpha -->
Allow only alphabetic characters
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Digits -->
Allow only digits
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Number -->
Edited field expects numbers
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Phone -->
Edited field expects phone number
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Url -->
Edited field expects URL
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Email -->
Edited field expects email address
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Name -->
Edited field expects the name of a person
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Password -->
Like `InputPurpose::FreeForm`, but characters are hidden
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Pin -->
Like `InputPurpose::Digits`, but characters are hidden

Feature: `v3_6`

<!-- enum Justification -->
Used for justifying the text inside a `Label` widget. (See also
`Alignment`).
<!-- enum Justification::variant Left -->
The text is placed at the left edge of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Right -->
The text is placed at the right edge of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Center -->
The text is placed in the center of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Fill -->
The text is placed is distributed across the label.
<!-- struct Label -->
The `Label` widget displays a small amount of text. As the name
implies, most labels are used to label another widget such as a
`Button`, a `MenuItem`, or a `ComboBox`.

# `Label` as `Buildable`

The `Label` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
“start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify `pango::Attribute` values for
this label.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:

```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  button = gtk_button_new ();
  label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (button), label);
```

There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
already inside:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
```

To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
`Entry`, you have to point the label at the entry with
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
  entry = gtk_entry_new ();
  label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
```

# Markup (styled text)

To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
[markup format][PangoMarkupFormat].

Here’s how to create a label with a small font:

```C
  label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
  gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
```

(See [complete documentation][PangoMarkupFormat] of available
tags in the Pango manual.)

The markup passed to `Label::set_markup` must be valid; for example,
literal <, > and & characters must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.
If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
`Label::set_markup`, you’ll want to escape it with
`g_markup_escape_text` or `g_markup_printf_escaped`.

Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the `pango::AttrList` on
a label; `Label::set_attributes` may be a simpler way to set
attributes in some cases. Be careful though; `pango::AttrList` tends to
cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
to [0, `G_MAXINT`)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
end_index for a `pango::Attribute` requires knowledge of the exact string
being displayed, so translations will cause problems.

# Selectable labels

Labels can be made selectable with `Label::set_selectable`.
Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information
— such as error messages — should be made selectable.

# Text layout # {`label`-text-layout}

A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
understood by Pango.

Labels can automatically wrap text if you call
`Label::set_line_wrap`.

`Label::set_justify` sets how the lines in a label align
with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole
aligns in its available space, see the `Widget::halign` and
`Widget:valign` properties.

The `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars` properties
can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or wrapped
labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.

Note that the interpretation of `Label:width-chars` and
`Label:max-width-chars` has changed a bit with the introduction of
[width-for-height geometry management.][geometry-management]

# Links

Since 2.18, GTK+ supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition
to regular Pango markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML,
using the `<a>` with “href“ and “title“ attributes. GTK+ renders links
similar to the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined
text. The “title“ attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link.

An example looks like this:


```C
const gchar *text =
"Go to the"
"<a href=\"http://www.gtk.org title="&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
"GTK+ website</a> for more...";
gtk_label_set_markup (label, text);
```

It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips with
the `Label::activate-link` signal and the `Label::get_current_uri` function.

# Implements

[`MiscExt`](trait.MiscExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Label::fn new -->
Creates a new label with the given text inside it. You can
pass `None` to get an empty label widget.
## `str`
The text of the label

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- impl Label::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `Label`, containing the text in `str`.

If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are
underlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use
'__' (two underscores). The first underlined character represents a
keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic. The mnemonic key can be used
to activate another widget, chosen automatically, or explicitly using
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.

If `Label::set_mnemonic_widget` is not called, then the first
activatable ancestor of the `Label` will be chosen as the mnemonic
widget. For instance, if the label is inside a button or menu item,
the button or menu item will automatically become the mnemonic widget
and be activated by the mnemonic.
## `str`
The text of the label, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_angle -->
Gets the angle of rotation for the label. See
`Label::set_angle`.

# Returns

the angle of rotation for the label
<!-- impl Label::fn get_attributes -->
Gets the attribute list that was set on the label using
`Label::set_attributes`, if any. This function does
not reflect attributes that come from the labels markup
(see `Label::set_markup`). If you want to get the
effective attributes for the label, use
pango_layout_get_attribute (gtk_label_get_layout (label)).

# Returns

the attribute list, or `None`
 if none was set.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_current_uri -->
Returns the URI for the currently active link in the label.
The active link is the one under the mouse pointer or, in a
selectable label, the link in which the text cursor is currently
positioned.

This function is intended for use in a `Label::activate-link` handler
or for use in a `Widget::query-tooltip` handler.

# Returns

the currently active URI. The string is owned by GTK+ and must
 not be freed or modified.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_ellipsize -->
Returns the ellipsizing position of the label. See `Label::set_ellipsize`.

# Returns

`pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_justify -->
Returns the justification of the label. See `Label::set_justify`.

# Returns

`Justification`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. (See
`Label::get_text`).

# Returns

the text of the label widget. This string is
 owned by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the label.
The layout is useful to e.g. convert text positions to
pixel positions, in combination with `Label::get_layout_offsets`.
The returned layout is owned by the `self` so need not be
freed by the caller. The `self` is free to recreate its layout at
any time, so it should be considered read-only.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this label
<!-- impl Label::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the label will draw the `pango::Layout`
representing the text in the label; useful to convert mouse events
into coordinates inside the `pango::Layout`, e.g. to take some action
if some part of the label is clicked. Of course you will need to
create a `EventBox` to receive the events, and pack the label
inside it, since labels are windowless (they return `false` from
`Widget::get_has_window`). Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` functions you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_line_wrap -->
Returns whether lines in the label are automatically wrapped.
See `Label::set_line_wrap`.

# Returns

`true` if the lines of the label are automatically wrapped.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_line_wrap_mode -->
Returns line wrap mode used by the label. See `Label::set_line_wrap_mode`.

# Returns

`true` if the lines of the label are automatically wrapped.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_lines -->
Gets the number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping
label should be limited. See `Label::set_lines`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

The number of lines
<!-- impl Label::fn get_max_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired maximum width of `self`, in characters. See
`Label::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the maximum width of the label in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_mnemonic_keyval -->
If the label has been set so that it has an mnemonic key this function
returns the keyval used for the mnemonic accelerator. If there is no
mnemonic set up it returns `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`.

# Returns

GDK keyval usable for accelerators, or `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_mnemonic_widget -->
Retrieves the target of the mnemonic (keyboard shortcut) of this
label. See `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.

# Returns

the target of the label’s mnemonic,
 or `None` if none has been set and the default algorithm will be used.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value set by `Label::set_selectable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can copy text from the label
<!-- impl Label::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Gets the selected range of characters in the label, returning `true`
if there’s a selection.
## `start`
return location for start of selection, as a character offset
## `end`
return location for end of selection, as a character offset

# Returns

`true` if selection is non-empty
<!-- impl Label::fn get_single_line_mode -->
Returns whether the label is in single line mode.

# Returns

`true` when the label is in single line mode.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_text -->
Fetches the text from a label widget, as displayed on the
screen. This does not include any embedded underlines
indicating mnemonics or Pango markup. (See `Label::get_label`)

# Returns

the text in the label widget. This is the internal
 string used by the label, and must not be modified.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_track_visited_links -->
Returns whether the label is currently keeping track
of clicked links.

# Returns

`true` if clicked links are remembered
<!-- impl Label::fn get_use_markup -->
Returns whether the label’s text is interpreted as marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See gtk_label_set_use_markup ().

# Returns

`true` if the label’s text will be parsed for markup.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns whether an embedded underline in the label indicates a
mnemonic. See `Label::set_use_underline`.

# Returns

`true` whether an embedded underline in the label indicates
 the mnemonic accelerator keys.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired width of `self`, in characters. See
`Label::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the width of the label in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_xalign -->
Gets the `Label:xalign` property for `self`.

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

the xalign property
<!-- impl Label::fn get_yalign -->
Gets the `Label:yalign` property for `self`.

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

the yalign property
<!-- impl Label::fn select_region -->
Selects a range of characters in the label, if the label is selectable.
See `Label::set_selectable`. If the label is not selectable,
this function has no effect. If `start_offset` or
`end_offset` are -1, then the end of the label will be substituted.
## `start_offset`
start offset (in characters not bytes)
## `end_offset`
end offset (in characters not bytes)
<!-- impl Label::fn set_angle -->
Sets the angle of rotation for the label. An angle of 90 reads from
from bottom to top, an angle of 270, from top to bottom. The angle
setting for the label is ignored if the label is selectable,
wrapped, or ellipsized.
## `angle`
the angle that the baseline of the label makes with
 the horizontal, in degrees, measured counterclockwise
<!-- impl Label::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
label text.

The attributes set with this function will be applied
and merged with any other attributes previously effected by way
of the `Label:use-underline` or `Label:use-markup` properties.
While it is not recommended to mix markup strings with manually set
attributes, if you must; know that the attributes will be applied
to the label after the markup string is parsed.
## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList`, or `None`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") to the text
if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_justify -->
Sets the alignment of the lines in the text of the label relative to
each other. `Justification::Left` is the default value when the widget is
first created with `Label::new`. If you instead want to set the
alignment of the label as a whole, use `Widget::set_halign` instead.
`Label::set_justify` has no effect on labels containing only a
single line.
## `jtype`
a `Justification`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of the label. The label is interpreted as
including embedded underlines and/or Pango markup depending
on the values of the `Label:use-underline`" and
`Label:use-markup` properties.
## `str`
the new text to set for the label
<!-- impl Label::fn set_line_wrap -->
Toggles line wrapping within the `Label` widget. `true` makes it break
lines if text exceeds the widget’s size. `false` lets the text get cut off
by the edge of the widget if it exceeds the widget size.

Note that setting line wrapping to `true` does not make the label
wrap at its parent container’s width, because GTK+ widgets
conceptually can’t make their requisition depend on the parent
container’s size. For a label that wraps at a specific position,
set the label’s width using `Widget::set_size_request`.
## `wrap`
the setting
<!-- impl Label::fn set_line_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see `Label::set_line_wrap`) this controls how
the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word` which means
wrap on word boundaries.
## `wrap_mode`
the line wrapping mode
<!-- impl Label::fn set_lines -->
Sets the number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited. This has no effect if the label is not wrapping
or ellipsized. Set this to -1 if you don’t want to limit the
number of lines.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `lines`
the desired number of lines, or -1
<!-- impl Label::fn set_markup -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat], setting the
label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results. If the `str` is
external data, you may need to escape it with `g_markup_escape_text` or
`g_markup_printf_escaped`:

```C
const char *format = "<span style=\"italic\">\%s</span>";
char *markup;

markup = g_markup_printf_escaped (format, str);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), markup);
g_free (markup);
```
## `str`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- impl Label::fn set_markup_with_mnemonic -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat],
setting the label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.

The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a markup string (see
 [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- impl Label::fn set_max_width_chars -->
Sets the desired maximum width in characters of `self` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired maximum width, in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_mnemonic_widget -->
If the label has been set so that it has an mnemonic key (using
i.e. `Label::set_markup_with_mnemonic`,
`Label::set_text_with_mnemonic`, `Label::new_with_mnemonic`
or the “use_underline” property) the label can be associated with a
widget that is the target of the mnemonic. When the label is inside
a widget (like a `Button` or a `Notebook` tab) it is
automatically associated with the correct widget, but sometimes
(i.e. when the target is a `Entry` next to the label) you need to
set it explicitly using this function.

The target widget will be accelerated by emitting the
`Widget`::mnemonic-activate signal on it. The default handler for
this signal will activate the widget if there are no mnemonic collisions
and toggle focus between the colliding widgets otherwise.
## `widget`
the target `Widget`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_pattern -->
The pattern of underlines you want under the existing text within the
`Label` widget. For example if the current text of the label says
“FooBarBaz” passing a pattern of “___ ___” will underline
“Foo” and “Baz” but not “Bar”.
## `pattern`
The pattern as described above.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_selectable -->
Selectable labels allow the user to select text from the label, for
copy-and-paste.
## `setting`
`true` to allow selecting text in the label
<!-- impl Label::fn set_single_line_mode -->
Sets whether the label is in single line mode.
## `single_line_mode`
`true` if the label should be in single line mode
<!-- impl Label::fn set_text -->
Sets the text within the `Label` widget. It overwrites any text that
was there before.

This will also clear any previously set mnemonic accelerators.
## `str`
The text you want to set
<!-- impl Label::fn set_text_with_mnemonic -->
Sets the label’s text from the string `str`.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.
The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a string
<!-- impl Label::fn set_track_visited_links -->
Sets whether the label should keep track of clicked
links (and use a different color for them).
## `track_links`
`true` to track visited links
<!-- impl Label::fn set_use_markup -->
Sets whether the text of the label contains markup in
[Pango’s text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `Label::set_markup`.
## `setting`
`true` if the label’s text should be parsed for markup.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text indicates the next character should be
used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `setting`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- impl Label::fn set_width_chars -->
Sets the desired width in characters of `self` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired width, in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_xalign -->
Sets the `Label:xalign` property for `self`.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `xalign`
the new xalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- impl Label::fn set_yalign -->
Sets the `Label:yalign` property for `self`.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `yalign`
the new yalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- struct Layout -->
`Layout` is similar to `DrawingArea` in that it’s a “blank slate”
and doesn’t do anything but paint a blank background by default. It's
different in that it supports scrolling natively (you can add it to a
`ScrolledWindow`), and it can contain child widgets, since it’s a
`Container`. However if you’re just going to draw, a `DrawingArea`
is a better choice since it has lower overhead.

When handling expose events on a `Layout`, you must draw to
GTK_LAYOUT (layout)->bin_window, rather than to
GTK_WIDGET (layout)->window, as you would for a drawing
area.

# Implements

[`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ScrollableExt`](trait.ScrollableExt.html)
<!-- impl Layout::fn new -->

 `self`, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the height set on
 `self`, or `None`
<!-- impl Layout::fn get_vadjustment -->

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `Scrollable::get_vadjustment`

# Returns

vertical scroll adjustment
<!-- impl Layout::fn move -->

<!-- struct LevelBar -->
The `LevelBar` is a bar widget that can be used
as a level indicator. Typical use cases are displaying the strength
of a password, or showing the charge level of a battery.

Use `LevelBar::set_value` to set the current value, and
`LevelBar::add_offset_value` to set the value offsets at which
the bar will be considered in a different state. GTK will add two offsets
by default on the level bar: `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW` and
`GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_HIGH`, with values 0.25 and 0.75 respectively.

## Adding a custom offset on the bar


```C

static GtkWidget *
create_level_bar (void)
{
  GtkWidget *widget;
  GtkLevelBar *bar;

  widget = gtk_level_bar_new ();
  bar = GTK_LEVEL_BAR (widget);

  /<!---->* This changes the value of the default low offset
  *<!---->/

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar,
                                  GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
                                  0.10);

  /<!---->* This adds a new offset to the bar; the application will
   be able to change its color by using the following selector,
   either by adding it to its CSS file or using
   gtk_css_provider_load_from_data() and
   gtk_style_context_add_provider()

   * .level-bar.fill-block.level-my-offset {
   *   background-color: green;
   *   border-style: solid;
   *   border-color: black;
   *   border-style: 1px;
   * }
   *<!---->/

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar, "my-offset", 0.60);

  return widget;
}
```

The default interval of values is between zero and one, but it’s possible to
modify the interval using `LevelBar::set_min_value` and
`LevelBar::set_max_value`. The value will be always drawn in proportion to
the admissible interval, i.e. a value of 15 with a specified interval between
10 and 20 is equivalent to a value of 0.5 with an interval between 0 and 1.
When `LevelBarMode::Discrete` is used, the bar level is rendered
as a finite and number of separated blocks instead of a single one. The number
of blocks that will be rendered is equal to the number of units specified by
the admissible interval.
For instance, to build a bar rendered with five blocks, it’s sufficient to
set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 5 after changing the indicator
mode to discrete.

<!-- struct LinkButton -->
A `LinkButton` is a `Button` with a hyperlink, similar to the one
used by web browsers, which triggers an action when clicked. It is useful
to show quick links to resources.

A link button is created by calling either `LinkButton::new` or
`LinkButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, the URI you pass
to the constructor is used as a label for the widget.

The URI bound to a `LinkButton` can be set specifically using
`LinkButton::set_uri`, and retrieved using `LinkButton::get_uri`.

By default, `LinkButton` calls `gtk_show_uri` when the button is
clicked. This behaviour can be overridden by connecting to the
`LinkButton::activate-link` signal and returning `true` from the
signal handler.

<!-- impl LinkButton::fn new -->
Creates a new `LinkButton` with the URI as its text.
## `uri`
a valid URI

# Returns

a new link button widget.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `LinkButton` containing a label.
## `uri`
a valid URI
## `label`
the text of the button

# Returns

a new link button widget.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_uri -->
Retrieves the URI set using `LinkButton::set_uri`.

# Returns

a valid URI. The returned string is owned by the link button
 and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_visited -->
Retrieves the “visited” state of the URI where the `LinkButton`
points. The button becomes visited when it is clicked. If the URI
is changed on the button, the “visited” state is unset again.

The state may also be changed using `LinkButton::set_visited`.

# Returns

`true` if the link has been visited, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_uri -->
Sets `uri` as the URI where the `LinkButton` points. As a side-effect
this unsets the “visited” state of the button.
## `uri`
a valid URI
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_visited -->
Sets the “visited” state of the URI where the `LinkButton`
points. See `LinkButton::get_visited` for more details.
## `visited`
the new “visited” state
<!-- struct ListBox -->
A `ListBox` is a vertical container that contains `ListBoxRow`
children. These rows can by dynamically sorted and filtered, and
headers can be added dynamically depending on the row content.
It also allows keyboard and mouse navigation and selection like
a typical list.

Using `ListBox` is often an alternative to `TreeView`, especially
when the list contents has a more complicated layout than what is allowed
by a `CellRenderer`, or when the contents is interactive (i.e. has a
button in it).

Although a `ListBox` must have only `ListBoxRow` children you can
add any kind of widget to it via `ContainerExt::add`, and a `ListBoxRow`
widget will automatically be inserted between the list and the widget.

``GtkListBoxRows`` can be marked as activatable or selectable. If a row
is activatable, `ListBox::row-activated` will be emitted for it when
the user tries to activate it. If it is selectable, the row will be marked
as selected when the user tries to select it.

The `ListBox` widget was added in GTK+ 3.10.

Feature: `v3_10`

# Implements

[`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl ListBox::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBox` container.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a new `ListBox`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn bind_model -->
Binds `model` to `self`.

If `self` was already bound to a model, that previous binding is
destroyed.

The contents of `self` are cleared and then filled with widgets that
represent items from `model`. `self` is updated whenever `model` changes.
If `model` is `None`, `self` is left empty.

It is undefined to add or remove widgets directly (for example, with
`ListBox::insert` or `ContainerExt::add`) while `self` is bound to a
model.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to be bound to `self`
## `create_widget_func`
a function that creates widgets for items
## `user_data`
user data passed to `create_widget_func`
## `user_data_free_func`
function for freeing `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn drag_highlight_row -->
This is a helper function for implementing DnD onto a `ListBox`.
The passed in `row` will be highlighted via `Widget::drag_highlight`,
and any previously highlighted row will be unhighlighted.

The row will also be unhighlighted when the widget gets
a drag leave event.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `row`
a `ListBoxRow`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn drag_unhighlight_row -->
If a row has previously been highlighted via `ListBox::drag_highlight_row`
it will have the highlight removed.

the row
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_selected_row -->
Gets the selected row.

Note that the box may allow multiple selection, in which
case you should use `ListBox::selected_foreach` to
find all selected rows.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the selected row
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_selected_rows -->
Creates a list of all selected children.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns


 A `glib::List` containing the `Widget` for each selected child.

Gets the selection mode of the listbox.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a `SelectionMode`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn insert -->
Insert the `child` into the `self` at `position`. If a sort function is
set, the widget will actually be inserted at the calculated position and
this function has the same effect of `ContainerExt::add`.

If `position` is -1, or larger than the total number of items in the
`self`, then the `child` will be appended to the end.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `child`
the `Widget` to add
## `position`
the position to insert `child` in
<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_filter -->
Update the filtering for all rows. Call this when result
of the filter function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor. For instance, this would be used
if the filter function just looked for a specific search
string and the entry with the search string has changed.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_headers -->
Update the separators for all rows. Call this when result
of the header function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_sort -->
Update the sorting for all rows. Call this when result
of the sort function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- impl ListBox::fn prepend -->
Prepend a widget to the list. If a sort function is set, the widget will
actually be inserted at the calculated position and this function has the
same effect of `ContainerExt::add`.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `child`
the `Widget` to add
<!-- impl ListBox::fn select_all -->
Select all children of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- impl ListBox::fn select_row -->
Make `row` the currently selected row.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `row`
The row to select or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected child.

Note that the selection cannot be modified from within this function.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `func`
the function to call for each selected child
## `data`
user data to pass to the function
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->
If `single` is `true`, rows will be activated when you click on them,
otherwise you need to double-click.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `single`
a boolean
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment (if any) that the widget uses to
for vertical scrolling. For instance, this is used
to get the page size for PageUp/Down key handling.

In the normal case when the `self` is packed inside
a `ScrolledWindow` the adjustment from that will
be picked up automatically, so there is no need
to manually do that.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `adjustment`
the adjustment, or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_filter_func -->
By setting a filter function on the `self` one can decide dynamically which
of the rows to show. For instance, to implement a search function on a list that
filters the original list to only show the matching rows.

The `filter_func` will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRow::changed`) or
when `ListBox::invalidate_filter` is called.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `filter_func`
callback that lets you filter which rows to show
## `user_data`
user data passed to `filter_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_header_func -->
By setting a header function on the `self` one can dynamically add headers
in front of rows, depending on the contents of the row and its position in the list.
For instance, one could use it to add headers in front of the first item of a
new kind, in a list sorted by the kind.

The `update_header` can look at the current header widget using `ListBoxRow::get_header`
and either update the state of the widget as needed, or set a new one using
`ListBoxRow::set_header`. If no header is needed, set the header to `None`.

Note that you may get many calls `update_header` to this for a particular row when e.g.
changing things that don’t affect the header. In this case it is important for performance
to not blindly replace an existing header with an identical one.

The `update_header` function will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRow::changed`) and when
the row before changes (either by `ListBoxRow::changed` on the previous row, or when
the previous row becomes a different row). It is also called for all rows when
`ListBox::invalidate_headers` is called.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `update_header`
callback that lets you add row headers
## `user_data`
user data passed to `update_header`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_placeholder -->
Sets the placeholder widget that is shown in the list when
it doesn't display any visible children.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `placeholder`
a `Widget` or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_selection_mode -->
Sets how selection works in the listbox.
See `SelectionMode` for details.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `mode`
The `SelectionMode`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_sort_func -->
By setting a sort function on the `self` one can dynamically reorder the rows
of the list, based on the contents of the rows.

The `sort_func` will be called for each row after the call, and will continue to
be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRow::changed`) and when
`ListBox::invalidate_sort` is called.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `sort_func`
the sort function
## `user_data`
user data passed to `sort_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn unselect_all -->
Unselect all children of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- impl ListBox::fn unselect_row -->
Unselects a single row of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `row`
the row to unselected
<!-- struct ListBoxRow -->


Feature: `v3_10`

# Implements

[`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBoxRow`, to be used as a child of a `ListBox`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a new `ListBoxRow`
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting, filtering and headers.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the row functions. For instance, if the list is
mirroring some external data set, and *two* rows changed in the
external data set then when you call `ListBoxRow::changed`
on the first row the sort function must only read the new data
for the first of the two changed rows, otherwise the resorting
of the rows will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model you have to duplicate the data that affects the listbox
row functions into the row widgets themselves. Another alternative
is to call `ListBox::invalidate_sort` on any model change,
but that is more expensive.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn get_activatable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property
for this row.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

`true` if the row is activatable
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn get_header -->
Returns the current header of the `self`. This can be used
in a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc`` to see if there is a header
set already, and if so to update the state of it.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the current header, or `None` if none
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn get_index -->
Gets the current index of the `self` in its `ListBox` container.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the index of the `self`, or -1 if the `self` is not in a listbox
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property
for this row.

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

`true` if the row is selectable

Returns whether the child is currently selected in its
`ListBox` container.

Feature: `v3_14`

Set the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property for this row.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `activatable`
`true` to mark the row as activatable
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn set_header -->
Sets the current header of the `self`. This is only allowed to be called
from a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc``. It will replace any existing
header in the row, and be shown in front of the row in the listbox.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `header`
the header, or `None`
<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn set_selectable -->
Set the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property for this row.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `selectable`
`true` to mark the row as selectable
<!-- struct ListStore -->
The `ListStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequentialy,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view.
Finally, it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk3-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

The `ListStore` can accept most GObject types as a column type, though
it can’t accept all custom types. Internally, it will keep a copy of
data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer). Columns that
accept `GObjects` are handled a little differently. The
`ListStore` will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
value. As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
application writer to call `TreeModel::row_changed` to emit the
`TreeModel::row_changed` signal. This most commonly affects lists with
``GdkPixbufs`` stored.

An example for creating a simple list store:

```C
enum {
  COLUMN_STRING,
  COLUMN_INT,
  COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

{
  GtkListStore *list_store;
  GtkTreePath *path;
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  gint i;

  list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                   G_TYPE_STRING,
                                   G_TYPE_INT,
                                   G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
      gchar *some_data;

      some_data = get_some_data (i);

      // Add a new row to the model
      gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
      gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                          COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
                          COLUMN_INT, i,
                          COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
                          -1);

      // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
      // we free some_data.
      g_free (some_data);
    }

  // Modify a particular row
  path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
  gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),
                           &iter,
                           path);
  gtk_tree_path_free (path);
  gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                      COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,
                      -1);
}
```

# Performance Considerations

Internally, the `ListStore` was implemented with a linked list with
a tail pointer prior to GTK+ 2.6. As a result, it was fast at data
insertion and deletion, and not fast at random data access. The
`ListStore` sets the `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag, which means
that ``GtkTreeIters`` can be cached while the row exists. Thus, if
access to a particular row is needed often and your code is expected to
run on older versions of GTK+, it is worth keeping the iter around.

# Atomic Operations

It is important to note that only the methods
`ListStore::insert_with_values` and `ListStore::insert_with_valuesv`
are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
values filled in in a single operation with regard to `TreeModel` signaling.
In contrast, using e.g. `ListStore::append` and then `ListStore::set`
will first create a row, which triggers the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal
on `ListStore`. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
connecting to `TreeModel::row-inserted` on this particular store should be prepared
for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
if you are wrapping the `ListStore` inside a `TreeModelFilter` and are
using a ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``. Using any of the non-atomic operations
to append rows to the `ListStore` will cause the
``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc`` to be visited with an empty row first; the
function must be prepared for that.

# `ListStore` as `Buildable`

The `ListStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
`<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.

Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
is to separate the two, as far as possible.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:

```C
<object class="GtkListStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
  <data>
    <row>
      <col id="0">John</col>
      <col id="1">Doe</col>
      <col id="2">25</col>
    </row>
    <row>
      <col id="0">Johan</col>
      <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
      <col id="2">50</col>
    </row>
  </data>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`TreeModelExt`](trait.TreeModelExt.html), [`TreeSortableExt`](trait.TreeSortableExt.html)
<!-- impl ListStore::fn new -->
Creates a new list store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_list_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF);` will create a new `ListStore` with three columns, of type
int, string and `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn newv -->
Non-vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `ListStore::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
<!-- impl ListStore::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from the list store.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows on the list,
then the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`ListStore::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- impl ListStore::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to the beginning of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to
this new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill
in values, you need to call `ListStore::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `ListStore::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows in the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with the
values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_list_store_insert_with_values (list_store, iter, position...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
gtk_list_store_insert (list_store, iter, position);
gtk_list_store_set (list_store, iter, ...);
```
with the difference that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and, if the list store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`ListStore::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted list store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing
 rows
<!-- impl ListStore::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `ListStore::insert_with_values` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row, or `None`.
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- impl ListStore::fn iter_is_valid -->
> This function is slow. Only use it for debugging and/or testing
> purposes.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `ListStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the start of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the end of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `ListStore::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepend row
<!-- impl ListStore::fn remove -->
Removes the given row from the list store. After being removed,
`iter` is set to be the next valid row, or invalidated if it pointed
to the last row in `self`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is valid, `false` if not.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn reorder -->
Reorders `self` to follow the order indicated by `new_order`. Note that
this function only works with unsorted stores.
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new
 position of each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`. It must have
 exactly as many items as the list store’s length.
<!-- impl ListStore::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write `gtk_list_store_set (store, iter,
0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
row iterator
<!-- impl ListStore::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from `ListStore`,
and should only be used when constructing a new `ListStore`. It will not
function after a row has been added, or a method on the `TreeModel`
interface is called.
## `n_columns`
Number of columns for the list store
## `types`
An array length n of `GTypes`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn set_valist -->
See `ListStore::set`; this version takes a va_list for use by language
bindings.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `var_args`
va_list of column/value pairs
<!-- impl ListStore::fn set_value -->
Sets the data in the cell specified by `iter` and `column`.
The type of `value` must be convertible to the type of the
column.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `column`
column number to modify
## `value`
new value for the cell
<!-- impl ListStore::fn set_valuesv -->
A variant of `ListStore::set_valist` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings and in case the number of columns to
change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- impl ListStore::fn swap -->
Swaps `a` and `b` in `self`. Note that this function only works with
unsorted stores.
## `a`
A `TreeIter`.
## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct Menu -->
A `Menu` is a `MenuShell` that implements a drop down menu
consisting of a list of `MenuItem` objects which can be navigated
and activated by the user to perform application functions.

A `Menu` is most commonly dropped down by activating a
`MenuItem` in a `MenuBar` or popped up by activating a
`MenuItem` in another `Menu`.

A `Menu` can also be popped up by activating a `ComboBox`.
Other composite widgets such as the `Notebook` can pop up a
`Menu` as well.

Applications can display a `Menu` as a popup menu by calling the
`Menu::popup` function. The example below shows how an application
can pop up a menu when the 3rd mouse button is pressed.

## Connecting the popup signal handler.


```C
  // connect our handler which will popup the menu
  g_signal_connect_swapped (window, "button_press_event",
G_CALLBACK (my_popup_handler), menu);
```

## Signal handler which displays a popup menu.


```C
static gint
my_popup_handler (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEvent *event)
{
  GtkMenu *menu;
  GdkEventButton *event_button;

  g_return_val_if_fail (widget != NULL, FALSE);
  g_return_val_if_fail (GTK_IS_MENU (widget), FALSE);
  g_return_val_if_fail (event != NULL, FALSE);

  // The "widget" is the menu that was supplied when
  // g_signal_connect_swapped() was called.
  menu = GTK_MENU (widget);

  if (event->type == GDK_BUTTON_PRESS)
    {
      event_button = (GdkEventButton *) event;
      if (event_button->button == GDK_BUTTON_SECONDARY)
        {
          gtk_menu_popup (menu, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                          event_button->button, event_button->time);
          return TRUE;
        }
    }

  return FALSE;
}
```

<!-- impl Menu::fn new -->
Creates a new `Menu`

# Returns

a new `Menu`
<!-- impl Menu::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a `Menu` and populates it with menu items and
submenus according to `model`.

The created menu items are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the menu belongs - typically
by means of being attached to a widget (see `Menu::attach_to_widget`)
that is contained within the ``GtkApplicationWindows`` widget hierarchy.

Actions can also be added using `Widget::insert_action_group` on the menu's
attach widget or on any of its parent widgets.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

a new `Menu`
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_for_attach_widget -->
Returns a list of the menus which are attached to this widget.
This list is owned by GTK+ and must not be modified.
## `widget`
a `Widget`

# Returns

the list
 of menus attached to his widget.
<!-- impl Menu::fn attach -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to a (table) menu. The number of “cells” that
an item will occupy is specified by `left_attach`, `right_attach`,
`top_attach` and `bottom_attach`. These each represent the leftmost,
rightmost, uppermost and lower column and row numbers of the table.
(Columns and rows are indexed from zero).

Note that this function is not related to `Menu::detach`.
## `child`
a `MenuItem`
## `left_attach`
The column number to attach the left side of the item to
## `right_attach`
The column number to attach the right side of the item to
## `top_attach`
The row number to attach the top of the item to
## `bottom_attach`
The row number to attach the bottom of the item to
<!-- impl Menu::fn attach_to_widget -->
Attaches the menu to the widget and provides a callback function
that will be invoked when the menu calls `Menu::detach` during
its destruction.

If the menu is attached to the widget then it will be destroyed
when the widget is destroyed, as if it was a child widget.
An attached menu will also move between screens correctly if the
widgets moves between screens.
## `attach_widget`
the `Widget` that the menu will be attached to
## `detacher`
the user supplied callback function
 that will be called when the menu calls `Menu::detach`
<!-- impl Menu::fn detach -->
Detaches the menu from the widget to which it had been attached.
This function will call the callback function, `detacher`, provided
when the `Menu::attach_to_widget` function was called.
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_accel_group -->
Gets the `AccelGroup` which holds global accelerators for the
menu. See `Menu::set_accel_group`.

# Returns

the `AccelGroup` associated with the menu
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_accel_path -->
Retrieves the accelerator path set on the menu.

# Returns

the accelerator path set on the menu.
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_active -->
Returns the selected menu item from the menu. This is used by the
`ComboBox`.

# Returns

the `MenuItem` that was last selected
 in the menu. If a selection has not yet been made, the
 first menu item is selected.
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_attach_widget -->
Returns the `Widget` that the menu is attached to.

# Returns

the `Widget` that the menu is attached to
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_monitor -->
Retrieves the number of the monitor on which to show the menu.

the number of the monitor on which the menu should
 be popped up or -1, if no monitor has been set
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_reserve_toggle_size -->
Returns whether the menu reserves space for toggles and
icons, regardless of their actual presence.

# Returns

Whether the menu reserves toggle space
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_tearoff_state -->
Returns whether the menu is torn off.
See `Menu::set_tearoff_state`.

# Deprecated since 3.10


# Returns

`true` if the menu is currently torn off.
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_title -->
Returns the title of the menu. See `Menu::set_title`.

# Deprecated since 3.10


# Returns

the title of the menu, or `None` if the menu
 has no title set on it. This string is owned by GTK+
 and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Menu::fn popdown -->
Removes the menu from the screen.
<!-- impl Menu::fn popup -->
Displays a menu and makes it available for selection.

Applications can use this function to display context-sensitive
menus, and will typically supply `None` for the `parent_menu_shell`,
`parent_menu_item`, `func` and `data` parameters. The default menu
positioning function will position the menu at the current mouse
cursor position.

The `button` parameter should be the mouse button pressed to initiate
the menu popup. If the menu popup was initiated by something other
than a mouse button press, such as a mouse button release or a keypress,
`button` should be 0.

The `activate_time` parameter is used to conflict-resolve initiation
of concurrent requests for mouse/keyboard grab requests. To function
properly, this needs to be the timestamp of the user event (such as
a mouse click or key press) that caused the initiation of the popup.
Only if no such event is available, `gtk_get_current_event_time` can
be used instead.
## `parent_menu_shell`
the menu shell containing the
 triggering menu item, or `None`
## `parent_menu_item`
the menu item whose activation
 triggered the popup, or `None`
## `func`
a user supplied function used to position
 the menu, or `None`
## `data`
user supplied data to be passed to `func`.
## `button`
the mouse button which was pressed to initiate the event.
## `activate_time`
the time at which the activation event occurred.
<!-- impl Menu::fn popup_for_device -->
Displays a menu and makes it available for selection.

Applications can use this function to display context-sensitive menus,
and will typically supply `None` for the `parent_menu_shell`,
`parent_menu_item`, `func`, `data` and `destroy` parameters. The default
menu positioning function will position the menu at the current position
of `device` (or its corresponding pointer).

The `button` parameter should be the mouse button pressed to initiate
the menu popup. If the menu popup was initiated by something other than
a mouse button press, such as a mouse button release or a keypress,
`button` should be 0.

The `activate_time` parameter is used to conflict-resolve initiation of
concurrent requests for mouse/keyboard grab requests. To function
properly, this needs to be the time stamp of the user event (such as
a mouse click or key press) that caused the initiation of the popup.
Only if no such event is available, `gtk_get_current_event_time` can
be used instead.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`
## `parent_menu_shell`
the menu shell containing the triggering
 menu item, or `None`
## `parent_menu_item`
the menu item whose activation triggered
 the popup, or `None`
## `func`
a user supplied function used to position the menu,
 or `None`
## `data`
user supplied data to be passed to `func`
## `destroy`
destroy notify for `data`
## `button`
the mouse button which was pressed to initiate the event
## `activate_time`
the time at which the activation event occurred
<!-- impl Menu::fn reorder_child -->
Moves `child` to a new `position` in the list of `self`
children.
## `child`
the `MenuItem` to move
## `position`
the new position to place `child`.
 Positions are numbered from 0 to n - 1
<!-- impl Menu::fn reposition -->
Repositions the menu according to its position function.
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_accel_group -->
Set the `AccelGroup` which holds global accelerators for the
menu. This accelerator group needs to also be added to all windows
that this menu is being used in with `Window::add_accel_group`,
in order for those windows to support all the accelerators
contained in this group.
## `accel_group`
the `AccelGroup` to be associated
 with the menu.
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_accel_path -->
Sets an accelerator path for this menu from which accelerator paths
for its immediate children, its menu items, can be constructed.
The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer the
inconvenience of having to call `MenuItem::set_accel_path` on
each menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators.
Instead, by just calling `Menu::set_accel_path` on their parent,
each menu item of this menu, that contains a label describing its
purpose, automatically gets an accel path assigned.

For example, a menu containing menu items “New” and “Exit”, will, after
`gtk_menu_set_accel_path (menu, "<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File");` has been
called, assign its items the accel paths: `"<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/New"`
and `"<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/Exit"`.

Assigning accel paths to menu items then enables the user to change
their accelerators at runtime. More details about accelerator paths
and their default setups can be found at `AccelMap::add_entry`.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore,
if you pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning
it first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_active -->
Selects the specified menu item within the menu. This is used by
the `ComboBox` and should not be used by anyone else.
## `index`
the index of the menu item to select. Index values are
 from 0 to n-1
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_monitor -->
Informs GTK+ on which monitor a menu should be popped up.
See `gdk::Screen::get_monitor_geometry`.

This function should be called from a ``GtkMenuPositionFunc``
if the menu should not appear on the same monitor as the pointer.
This information can’t be reliably inferred from the coordinates
returned by a ``GtkMenuPositionFunc``, since, for very long menus,
these coordinates may extend beyond the monitor boundaries or even
the screen boundaries.
## `monitor_num`
the number of the monitor on which the menu should
 be popped up
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_reserve_toggle_size -->
Sets whether the menu should reserve space for drawing toggles
or icons, regardless of their actual presence.
## `reserve_toggle_size`
whether to reserve size for toggles
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_screen -->
Sets the `gdk::Screen` on which the menu will be displayed.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`, or `None` if the screen should be
 determined by the widget the menu is attached to
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_tearoff_state -->
Changes the tearoff state of the menu. A menu is normally
displayed as drop down menu which persists as long as the menu is
active. It can also be displayed as a tearoff menu which persists
until it is closed or reattached.

# Deprecated since 3.10

## `torn_off`
If `true`, menu is displayed as a tearoff menu.
<!-- impl Menu::fn set_title -->
Sets the title string for the menu.

The title is displayed when the menu is shown as a tearoff
menu. If `title` is `None`, the menu will see if it is attached
to a parent menu item, and if so it will try to use the same
text as that menu item’s label.

# Deprecated since 3.10

## `title`
a string containing the title for the menu
<!-- struct MenuBar -->
The `MenuBar` is a subclass of `MenuShell` which contains one or
more ``GtkMenuItems``. The result is a standard menu bar which can hold
many menu items.

# Implements

[`MenuShellExt`](trait.MenuShellExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `MenuBar`

# Returns

the new menu bar, as a `Widget`
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a new `MenuBar` and populates it with menu items
and submenus according to `model`.

The created menu items are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the menu bar belongs - typically
by means of being contained within the ``GtkApplicationWindows``
widget hierarchy.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

a new `MenuBar`
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn get_child_pack_direction -->
Retrieves the current child pack direction of the menubar.
See `MenuBar::set_child_pack_direction`.

# Returns

the child pack direction
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn get_pack_direction -->
Retrieves the current pack direction of the menubar.
See `MenuBar::set_pack_direction`.

# Returns

the pack direction
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn set_child_pack_direction -->
Sets how widgets should be packed inside the children of a menubar.
## `child_pack_dir`
a new `PackDirection`
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn set_pack_direction -->
Sets how items should be packed inside a menubar.
## `pack_dir`
a new `PackDirection`
<!-- struct MenuButton -->
The `MenuButton` widget is used to display a popup when clicked on.
This popup can be provided either as a `Menu`, a `Popover` or an
abstract `gio::MenuModel`.

The `MenuButton` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it
can hold almost any other standard `Widget`. The most commonly used
child is `Image`. If no widget is explicitely added to the `MenuButton`,
a `Image` is automatically created, using an arrow image oriented
according to `MenuButton:direction` or the generic "view-context-menu"
icon if the direction is not set.

The positioning of the popup is determined by the `MenuButton:direction`
property of the menu button.

For menus, the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties of the
menu are also taken into account. For example, when the direction is
`ArrowType::Down` and the horizontal alignment is `Align::Start`, the
menu will be positioned below the button, with the starting edge
(depending on the text direction) of the menu aligned with the starting
edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

<!-- impl MenuButton::fn get_use_popover -->
Returns whether a `Popover` or a `Menu` will be constructed
from the menu model.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

`true` if using a `Popover`
<!-- impl MenuButton::fn set_align_widget -->
Sets the `Widget` to use to line the menu with when popped up.
Note that the `align_widget` must contain the `MenuButton` itself.

Setting it to `None` means that the menu will be aligned with the
button itself.

Note that this property is only used with menus currently,
and not for popovers.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `align_widget`
a `Widget`
<!-- impl MenuButton::fn set_direction -->
Sets the direction in which the popup will be popped up, as
well as changing the arrow’s direction. The child will not
be changed to an arrow if it was customized.

If the does not fit in the available space in the given direction,
GTK+ will its best to keep it inside the screen and fully visible.

If you pass `ArrowType::None` for a `direction`, the popup will behave
as if you passed `ArrowType::Down` (although you won’t see any arrows).

Feature: `v3_6`

## `direction`
a `ArrowType`
<!-- impl MenuButton::fn set_menu_model -->
Sets the `gio::MenuModel` from which the popup will be constructed,
or `None` to disable the button.

Depending on the value of `MenuButton:use-popover`, either a
`Menu` will be created with `Menu::new_from_model`, or a
`Popover` with `Popover::new_from_model`. In either case,
actions will be connected as documented for these functions.

If `MenuButton:popup` or `MenuButton:popover` are already set,
their content will be lost and replaced by the newly created popup.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `menu_model`
a `gio::MenuModel`
<!-- impl MenuButton::fn set_popover -->
Sets the `Popover` that will be popped up when the button is
clicked, or `None` to disable the button. If `MenuButton:menu-model`
or `MenuButton:popup` are set, they will be set to `None`.

Feature: `v3_12`

<!-- enum MenuDirectionType -->
An enumeration representing directional movements within a menu.
<!-- enum MenuDirectionType::variant Parent -->

<!-- enum MenuDirectionType::variant Next -->
To the next menu item
<!-- enum MenuDirectionType::variant Prev -->
To the previous menu item
<!-- struct MenuItem -->
The `MenuItem` widget and the derived widgets are the only valid
children for menus. Their function is to correctly handle highlighting,
alignment, events and submenus.

As a `MenuItem` derives from `Bin` it can hold any valid child widget,
although only a few are really useful.

By default, a `MenuItem` sets a `AccelLabel` as its child.
`MenuItem` has direct functions to set the label and its mnemonic.
For more advanced label settings, you can fetch the child widget from the `Bin`.

An example for setting markup and accelerator on a MenuItem:

```C
GtkWidget *child = gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (menu_item));
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (child), "<i>new label</i> with <b>markup</b>");
gtk_accel_label_set_accel (GTK_ACCEL_LABEL (child), GDK_KEY_1, 0);
```

# `MenuItem` as `Buildable`

The `MenuItem` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding a submenu by specifying “submenu” as the “type” attribute of
a `<child>` element.

An example of UI definition fragment with submenus:

```text
<object class="GtkMenuItem">
  <child type="submenu">
    <object class="GtkMenu"/>
  </child>
</object>
```

## `label`
the text for the label

# Returns

the newly created `MenuItem`
<!-- impl MenuItem::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `MenuItem` containing a label.

The label will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`,
so underscores in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the menu item.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `MenuItem`
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn activate -->
Emits the `MenuItem::activate` signal on the given item
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn deselect -->
Emits the `MenuItem::deselect` signal on the given item.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_accel_path -->
Retrieve the accelerator path that was previously set on `self`.

See `MenuItemExt::set_accel_path` for details.

# Returns

the accelerator path corresponding to this menu
 item’s functionality, or `None` if not set
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_label -->
Sets `text` on the `self` label

# Returns

The text in the `self` label. This is the internal
 string used by the label, and must not be modified.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_reserve_indicator -->
Returns whether the `self` reserves space for
the submenu indicator, regardless if it has a submenu
or not.

# Returns

`true` if `self` always reserves space for the
 submenu indicator
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_right_justified -->
Gets whether the menu item appears justified at the right
side of the menu bar.

# Deprecated since 3.2

See `MenuItem::set_right_justified`

# Returns

`true` if the menu item will appear at the
 far right if added to a menu bar.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_submenu -->
Gets the submenu underneath this menu item, if any.
See `MenuItemExt::set_submenu`.

# Returns

submenu for this menu item, or `None` if none
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Checks if an underline in the text indicates the next character
should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.

# Returns

`true` if an embedded underline in the label
 indicates the mnemonic accelerator key.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn select -->
Emits the `MenuItem::select` signal on the given item.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_accel_path -->
Set the accelerator path on `self`, through which runtime
changes of the menu item’s accelerator caused by the user can be
identified and saved to persistent storage (see `AccelMap::save`
on this). To set up a default accelerator for this menu item, call
`AccelMap::add_entry` with the same `accel_path`. See also
`AccelMap::add_entry` on the specifics of accelerator paths,
and `Menu::set_accel_path` for a more convenient variant of
this function.

This function is basically a convenience wrapper that handles
calling `Widget::set_accel_path` with the appropriate accelerator
group for the menu item.

Note that you do need to set an accelerator on the parent menu with
`Menu::set_accel_group` for this to work.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`.
Therefore, if you pass a static string, you can save some memory
by interning it first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
accelerator path, corresponding to this menu
 item’s functionality, or `None` to unset the current path.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_label -->
Sets `text` on the `self` label
## `label`
the text you want to set
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_reserve_indicator -->
Sets whether the `self` should reserve space for
the submenu indicator, regardless if it actually has
a submenu or not.

There should be little need for applications to call
this functions.
## `reserve`
the new value
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_right_justified -->
Sets whether the menu item appears justified at the right
side of a menu bar. This was traditionally done for “Help”
menu items, but is now considered a bad idea. (If the widget
layout is reversed for a right-to-left language like Hebrew
or Arabic, right-justified-menu-items appear at the left.)

# Deprecated since 3.2

If you insist on using it, use
 `Widget::set_hexpand` and `Widget::set_halign`.
## `right_justified`
if `true` the menu item will appear at the
 far right if added to a menu bar
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_submenu -->
Sets or replaces the menu item’s submenu, or removes it when a `None`
submenu is passed.
## `submenu`
the submenu, or `None`
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text indicates the next character
should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `setting`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn toggle_size_allocate -->
Emits the `MenuItem::toggle-size-allocate` signal on the given item.
## `allocation`
the allocation to use as signal data.
<!-- trait MenuItemExt::fn toggle_size_request -->
Emits the `MenuItem::toggle-size-request` signal on the given item.
## `requisition`
the requisition to use as signal data.
<!-- struct MenuShell -->
A `MenuShell` is the abstract base class used to derive the
`Menu` and `MenuBar` subclasses.

A `MenuShell` is a container of `MenuItem` objects arranged
in a list which can be navigated, selected, and activated by the
user to perform application functions. A `MenuItem` can have a
submenu associated with it, allowing for nested hierarchical menus.

# Terminology

A menu item can be “selected”, this means that it is displayed
in the prelight state, and if it has a submenu, that submenu
will be popped up.

A menu is “active” when it is visible onscreen and the user
is selecting from it. A menubar is not active until the user
clicks on one of its menuitems. When a menu is active,
passing the mouse over a submenu will pop it up.

There is also is a concept of the current menu and a current
menu item. The current menu item is the selected menu item
that is furthest down in the hierarchy. (Every active menu shell
does not necessarily contain a selected menu item, but if
it does, then the parent menu shell must also contain
a selected menu item.) The current menu is the menu that
contains the current menu item. It will always have a GTK
grab and receive all key presses.

# Implements

[`MenuShellExt`](trait.MenuShellExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)

<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn activate_item -->
Activates the menu item within the menu shell.
## `menu_item`
the `MenuItem` to activate
## `force_deactivate`
if `true`, force the deactivation of the
 menu shell after the menu item is activated
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn append -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the end of the menu shell's
item list.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn bind_model -->
Establishes a binding between a `MenuShell` and a `gio::MenuModel`.

The contents of `shell` are removed and then refilled with menu items
according to `model`. When `model` changes, `shell` is updated.
Calling this function twice on `shell` with different `model` will
cause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the new
model. If `model` is `None` then any previous binding is undone and
all children are removed.

`with_separators` determines if toplevel items (eg: sections) have
separators inserted between them. This is typically desired for
menus but doesn’t make sense for menubars.

If `action_namespace` is non-`None` then the effect is as if all
actions mentioned in the `model` have their names prefixed with the
namespace, plus a dot. For example, if the action “quit” is
mentioned and `action_namespace` is “app” then the effective action
name is “app.quit”.

This function uses `Actionable` to define the action name and
target values on the created menu items. If you want to use an
action group other than “app” and “win”, or if you want to use a
`MenuShell` outside of a `ApplicationWindow`, then you will need
to attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy using
`Widget::insert_action_group`. As an example, if you created a
group with a “quit” action and inserted it with the name “mygroup”
then you would use the action name “mygroup.quit” in your
`gio::MenuModel`.

For most cases you are probably better off using
`Menu::new_from_model` or `MenuBar::new_from_model` or just
directly passing the `gio::MenuModel` to `Application::set_app_menu` or
`Application::set_menubar`.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `model`
the `gio::MenuModel` to bind to or `None` to remove
 binding
## `action_namespace`
the namespace for actions in `model`
## `with_separators`
`true` if toplevel items in `shell` should have
 separators between them
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn cancel -->
Cancels the selection within the menu shell.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn deactivate -->
Deactivates the menu shell.

Typically this results in the menu shell being erased
from the screen.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn deselect -->
Deselects the currently selected item from the menu shell,
if any.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_parent_shell -->
Gets the parent menu shell.

The parent menu shell of a submenu is the `Menu` or `MenuBar`
from which it was opened up.

# Returns

the parent `MenuShell`
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_selected_item -->
Gets the currently selected item.

# Returns

the currently selected item
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_take_focus -->
Returns `true` if the menu shell will take the keyboard focus on popup.

# Returns

`true` if the menu shell will take the keyboard focus on popup.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn insert -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the menu shell’s item list
at the position indicated by `position`.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
## `position`
The position in the item list where `child`
 is added. Positions are numbered from 0 to n-1
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn prepend -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the beginning of the menu shell's
item list.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn select_first -->
Select the first visible or selectable child of the menu shell;
don’t select tearoff items unless the only item is a tearoff
item.
## `search_sensitive`
if `true`, search for the first selectable
 menu item, otherwise select nothing if
 the first item isn’t sensitive. This
 should be `false` if the menu is being
 popped up initially.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn select_item -->
Selects the menu item from the menu shell.
## `menu_item`
The `MenuItem` to select
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn set_take_focus -->
If `take_focus` is `true` (the default) the menu shell will take
the keyboard focus so that it will receive all keyboard events
which is needed to enable keyboard navigation in menus.

Setting `take_focus` to `false` is useful only for special applications
like virtual keyboard implementations which should not take keyboard
focus.

The `take_focus` state of a menu or menu bar is automatically
propagated to submenus whenever a submenu is popped up, so you
don’t have to worry about recursively setting it for your entire
menu hierarchy. Only when programmatically picking a submenu and
popping it up manually, the `take_focus` property of the submenu
needs to be set explicitly.

Note that setting it to `false` has side-effects:

If the focus is in some other app, it keeps the focus and keynav in
the menu doesn’t work. Consequently, keynav on the menu will only
work if the focus is on some toplevel owned by the onscreen keyboard.

To avoid confusing the user, menus with `take_focus` set to `false`
should not display mnemonics or accelerators, since it cannot be
guaranteed that they will work.

See also `gdk_keyboard_grab`
## `take_focus`
`true` if the menu shell should take the keyboard
 focus on popup
<!-- struct MenuToolButton -->
A `MenuToolButton` is a `ToolItem` that contains a button and
a small additional button with an arrow. When clicked, the arrow
button pops up a dropdown menu.

Use `MenuToolButton::new` to create a new
`MenuToolButton`.

# `MenuToolButton` as `Buildable`

The `MenuToolButton` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding a menu by specifying “menu” as the “type” attribute
of a `<child>` element.

An example for a UI definition fragment with menus:

<!-- impl MenuToolButton::fn set_arrow_tooltip_markup -->
Sets the tooltip markup text to be used as tooltip for the arrow button
which pops up the menu. See `ToolItem::set_tooltip_text` for setting
a tooltip on the whole `MenuToolButton`.
## `markup`
markup text to be used as tooltip text for button’s arrow button
<!-- impl MenuToolButton::fn set_arrow_tooltip_text -->

<!-- struct MessageDialog -->
`MessageDialog` presents a dialog with some message text. It’s simply a
convenience widget; you could construct the equivalent of `MessageDialog`
from `Dialog` without too much effort, but `MessageDialog` saves typing.

One difference from `Dialog` is that `MessageDialog` sets the
`Window:skip-taskbar-hint` property to `true`, so that the dialog is hidden
from the taskbar by default.

The easiest way to do a modal message dialog is to use `DialogExt::run`, though
you can also pass in the `DialogFlags::Modal` flag, `DialogExt::run` automatically
makes the dialog modal and waits for the user to respond to it. `DialogExt::run`
returns when any dialog button is clicked.

An example for using a modal dialog:

```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                  filename,
                                  g_strerror (errno));
 gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

You might do a non-modal `MessageDialog` as follows:

An example for a non-modal dialog:

```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                  filename,
                                  g_strerror (errno));

 // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
 // (e.g. clicks a button)

 g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog, "response",
                           G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy),
                           dialog);
```

# `MessageDialog` as `Buildable`

<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text
the user may want to see. When the user clicks a button a “response”
signal is emitted with response IDs from `ResponseType`. See
`Dialog` for more details.
## `parent`
transient parent, or `None` for none
## `flags`
flags
## `type_`
type of message
## `buttons`

# Returns

a new `MessageDialog`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new_with_markup -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text that
is marked up with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
When the user clicks a button a “response” signal is emitted with
response IDs from `ResponseType`. See `Dialog` for more details.

Special XML characters in the `printf` arguments passed to this
function will automatically be escaped as necessary.
(See `g_markup_printf_escaped` for how this is implemented.)
Usually this is what you want, but if you have an existing
Pango markup string that you want to use literally as the
label, then you need to use `MessageDialog::set_markup`
instead, since you can’t pass the markup string either
as the format (it might contain “%” characters) or as a string
argument.

```C
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,

<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn format_secondary_markup -->
Sets the secondary text of the message dialog to be `message_format` (with
`printf`-style), which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Due to an oversight, this function does not escape special XML characters
like `MessageDialog::new_with_markup` does. Thus, if the arguments
may contain special XML characters, you should use `g_markup_printf_escaped`
to escape it.


```C
gchar *msg;

msg = g_markup_printf_escaped (message_format, ...);
gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup (message_dialog,
                                            "%s", msg);
g_free (msg);
```
## `message_format`

function in the parent `Dialog`.

# Returns

<!-- struct Misc -->
`[Deprecated since 3.14]` The `Misc` widget is an abstract widget which is not useful itself, but
is used to derive subclasses which have alignment and padding attributes.

The horizontal and vertical padding attributes allows extra space to be
added around the widget.

The horizontal and vertical alignment attributes enable the widget to be
positioned within its allocated area. Note that if the widget is added to
a container in such a way that it expands automatically to fill its
allocated area, the alignment settings will not alter the widget's position.

Note that the desired effect can in most cases be achieved by using the
`Widget:halign`, `Widget:valign` and `Widget:margin` properties
on the child widget, so `Misc` should not be used in new code. To reflect
this fact, all `Misc` API has been deprecated.

<!-- struct Notebook -->
The `Notebook` widget is a `Container` whose children are pages that
can be switched between using tab labels along one edge.

There are many configuration options for `Notebook`. Among other
things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear
(see `Notebook::set_tab_pos`), whether, if there are too many
tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling
arrows added (see `Notebook::set_scrollable`), and whether there
will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages.
(see `Notebook::popup_enable`, `Notebook::popup_disable`)

# `Notebook` as `Buildable`

The `Notebook` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing children into tabs by specifying “tab” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. Note that the content
of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled.
A tab child can be specified without specifying a `<child>`
type attribute.

To add a child widget in the notebooks action area, specify
"action-start" or “action-end” as the “type” attribute of the
`<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Notebook`:

```text
<object class="GtkNotebook">
  <child>
    <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-content">
      <property name="label">Content</property>
    </object>
  </child>
  <child type="tab">
    <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-tab">
      <property name="label">Tab</property>

## `menu_label`
the widget to use as a label for the
 page-switch menu, if that is enabled. If `None`, and `tab_label`
 is a `Label` or `None`, then the menu label will be a newly
 created label with the same text as `tab_label`; if `tab_label`
 is not a `Label`, `menu_label` must be specified if the
 page-switch menu is to be used.

# Returns

the index (starting from 0) of the appended
 page in the notebook, or -1 if function fails
<!-- impl Notebook::fn detach_tab -->

the widget will be placed before or after the tabs. You can use
a `Box` if you need to pack more than one widget on the same side.

Note that action widgets are “internal” children of the notebook and thus
not included in the list returned from `ContainerExt::foreach`.
## `widget`

 If negative, the last page will be used. If greater
 than the number of pages in the notebook, nothing
 will be done.
<!-- impl Notebook::fn set_group_name -->

<!-- impl Notebook::fn set_show_tabs -->
Sets whether to show the tabs for the notebook or not.
## `show_tabs`
`true` if the tabs should be shown
<!-- impl Notebook::fn set_tab_detachable -->
Sets whether the tab can be detached from `self` to another
notebook or widget.

Note that 2 notebooks must share a common group identificator
(see `Notebook::set_group_name`) to allow automatic tabs
interchange between them.

If you want a widget to interact with a notebook through DnD
(i.e.: accept dragged tabs from it) it must be set as a drop
destination and accept the target “GTK_NOTEBOOK_TAB”. The notebook
will fill the selection with a `Widget`** pointing to the child
widget that corresponds to the dropped tab.

Note that you should use `Notebook::detach_tab` instead
of `ContainerExt::remove` if you want to remove the tab from
the source notebook as part of accepting a drop. Otherwise,
the source notebook will think that the dragged tab was
removed from underneath the ongoing drag operation, and
will initiate a drag cancel animation.


```C
 static void
 on_drag_data_received (GtkWidget        *widget,
                        GdkDragContext   *context,
                        gint              x,
                        gint              y,
                        GtkSelectionData *data,
                        guint             info,
                        guint             time,
                        gpointer          user_data)
 {
   GtkWidget *notebook;
   GtkWidget **child;

   notebook = gtk_drag_get_source_widget (context);
   child = (void*) gtk_selection_data_get_data (data);

   process_widget (*child);
   gtk_notebook_detach_tab (GTK_NOTEBOOK (notebook), *child);
 }
```

<!-- struct Orientable -->
The `Orientable` interface is implemented by all widgets that can be
oriented horizontally or vertically. Historically, such widgets have been
realized as subclasses of a common base class (e.g `Box`/`HBox`/`VBox`
or `Scale`/`HScale`/`VScale`). `Orientable` is more flexible in that
it allows the orientation to be changed at runtime, allowing the widgets
to “flip”.

`Orientable` was introduced in GTK+ 2.16.

<!-- trait OrientableExt::fn get_orientation -->
Retrieves the orientation of the `self`.

# Returns

## `orientation`
the orientable’s new orientation.
<!-- enum Orientation -->
Represents the orientation of widgets and other objects which can be switched
between horizontal and vertical orientation on the fly, like `Toolbar` or
`GesturePan`.
<!-- enum Orientation::variant Horizontal -->
The element is in horizontal orientation.
<!-- enum Orientation::variant Vertical -->
The element is in vertical orientation.
<!-- struct Overlay -->
`Overlay` is a container which contains a single main child, on top
of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The
position of each overlay widget is determined by its `Widget:halign`
and `Widget:valign` properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments
set to `Align::Start` will be placed at the top left corner of the
main widget, whereas an overlay with halign set to `Align::Center`
and valign set to `Align::End` will be placed a the bottom edge of
the main widget, horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted
by setting the margin properties of the child to non-zero values.

More complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting
to the `Overlay::get-child-position` signal.

# `Overlay` as `Buildable`

The `Overlay` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing a child as an overlay by specifying “overlay” as
the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

# Implements

[`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Overlay::fn new -->
Creates a new `Overlay`.

# Returns

a new `Overlay` object.
<!-- impl Overlay::fn add_overlay -->
Adds `widget` to `self`.

The widget will be stacked on top of the main widget
added with `ContainerExt::add`.

The position at which `widget` is placed is determined
from its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties.
## `widget`
a `Widget` to be added to the container
<!-- enum PackDirection -->
Determines how widgets should be packed inside menubars
and menuitems contained in menubars.
<!-- enum PackDirection::variant Ltr -->
Widgets are packed left-to-right

<!-- enum PageOrientation::variant Landscape -->
Landscape mode.

Reverse portrait mode.
<!-- enum PageOrientation::variant ReverseLandscape -->
Reverse landscape mode.
<!-- enum PageSet -->
See also `gtk_print_job_set_page_set`.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant All -->
All pages.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant Even -->
Even pages.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant Odd -->
Odd pages.
<!-- struct PageSetup -->
A `PageSetup` object stores the page size, orientation and margins.
The idea is that you can get one of these from the page setup dialog
and then pass it to the `PrintOperation` when printing.
The benefit of splitting this out of the `PrintSettings` is that
these affect the actual layout of the page, and thus need to be set
long before user prints.

## Margins ## {`print`-margins}
The margins specified in this object are the “print margins”, i.e. the
parts of the page that the printer cannot print on. These are different
from the layout margins that a word processor uses; they are typically
used to determine the minimal size for the layout
margins.

To obtain a `PageSetup` use `PageSetup::new` to get the defaults,
or use `gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog` to show the page setup dialog
and receive the resulting page setup.

## A page setup dialog


```C
static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;
static GtkPageSetup *page_setup = NULL;

static void
do_page_setup (void)
{
  GtkPageSetup *new_page_setup;

  if (settings == NULL)
    settings = gtk_print_settings_new ();

  new_page_setup = gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog (GTK_WINDOW (main_window),
                                                    page_setup, settings);

  if (page_setup)
    g_object_unref (page_setup);

  page_setup = new_page_setup;
}
```

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- struct Paned -->
`Paned` has two panes, arranged either
horizontally or vertically. The division between
the two panes is adjustable by the user by dragging
a handle.

Child widgets are
added to the panes of the widget with `Paned::pack1` and
`Paned::pack2`. The division between the two children is set by default
from the size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the
user.

A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a
small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not
draw any relief around the children or around the separator. (The space
in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to put
each child inside a `Frame` with the shadow type set to `ShadowType::In`
so that the gutter appears as a ridge. No separator is drawn if one of
the children is missing.

Each child has two options that can be set, `resize` and `shrink`. If
`resize` is true, then when the `Paned` is resized, that child will
expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If `shrink` is true, then
that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user.
Setting `shrink` to `false` allows the application to set a minimum size.
If `resize` is false for both children, then this is treated as if
`resize` is true for both children.

The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set
by the user, by calling `Paned::set_position`.

## Creating a paned widget with minimum sizes.

`PaperSize` handles paper sizes. It uses the standard called
[PWG 5101.1-2002 PWG: Standard for Media Standardized Names](http://www.pwg.org/standards.html)
to name the paper sizes (and to get the data for the page sizes).
In addition to standard paper sizes, `PaperSize` allows to
construct custom paper sizes with arbitrary dimensions.

The `PaperSize` object stores not only the dimensions (width
and height) of a paper size and its name, it also provides
default [print margins][print-margins].

Printing support has been added in GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- struct PlacesSidebar -->
`PlacesSidebar` is a widget that displays a list of frequently-used places in the
file system: the user’s home directory, the user’s bookmarks, and volumes and drives.
This widget is used as a sidebar in `FileChooser` and may be used by file managers
and similar programs.

The places sidebar displays drives and volumes, and will automatically mount
or unmount them when the user selects them.

Applications can hook to various signals in the places sidebar to customize
its behavior. For example, they can add extra commands to the context menu
of the sidebar.

While bookmarks are completely in control of the user, the places sidebar also
allows individual applications to provide extra shortcut folders that are unique
to each application. For example, a Paint program may want to add a shortcut
for a Clipart folder. You can do this with `PlacesSidebar::add_shortcut`.

To make use of the places sidebar, an application at least needs to connect
to the `PlacesSidebar::open-location` signal. This is emitted when the
user selects in the sidebar a location to open. The application should also
call `PlacesSidebar::set_location` when it changes the currently-viewed
location.

Feature: `v3_10`

# Implements

[`ScrolledWindowExt`](trait.ScrolledWindowExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn new -->
Creates a new `PlacesSidebar` widget.

The application should connect to at least the
`PlacesSidebar::open-location` signal to be notified
when the user makes a selection in the sidebar.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a newly created `PlacesSidebar`
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn add_shortcut -->
Applications may want to present some folders in the places sidebar if
they could be immediately useful to users. For example, a drawing
program could add a “/usr/share/clipart” location when the sidebar is
being used in an “Insert Clipart” dialog box.

This function adds the specified `location` to a special place for immutable
shortcuts. The shortcuts are application-specific; they are not shared
across applications, and they are not persistent. If this function
is called multiple times with different locations, then they are added
to the sidebar’s list in the same order as the function is called.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `location`
location to add as an application-specific shortcut
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_local_only -->
Returns the value previously set with `PlacesSidebar::set_local_only`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

`true` if the sidebar will only show local files.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_location -->
Gets the currently-selected location in the `self`. This can be `None` when
nothing is selected, for example, when `PlacesSidebar::set_location` has
been called with a location that is not among the sidebar’s list of places to
show.

You can use this function to get the selection in the `self`. Also, if you
connect to the `PlacesSidebar::populate-popup` signal, you can use this
function to get the location that is being referred to during the callbacks
for your menu items.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a GFile with the selected location, or `None` if nothing is visually
selected.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_nth_bookmark -->
This function queries the bookmarks added by the user to the places sidebar,
and returns one of them. This function is used by `FileChooser` to implement
the “Alt-1”, “Alt-2”, etc. shortcuts, which activate the cooresponding bookmark.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `n`
index of the bookmark to query

# Returns

The bookmark specified by the index `n`, or
`None` if no such index exist. Note that the indices start at 0, even though
the file chooser starts them with the keyboard shortcut “Alt-1”.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_open_flags -->
Gets the open flags.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the `PlacesOpenFlags` of `self`
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_show_connect_to_server -->
Returns the value previously set with `PlacesSidebar::set_show_connect_to_server`

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

`true` if the sidebar will display a “Connect to Server” item.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_show_desktop -->
Returns the value previously set with `PlacesSidebar::set_show_desktop`

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

`true` if the sidebar will display a builtin shortcut to the desktop folder.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn get_show_enter_location -->
Returns the value previously set with `PlacesSidebar::set_show_enter_location`

Feature: `v3_14`


# Returns

`true` if the sidebar will display an “Enter Location” item.
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn list_shortcuts -->
Gets the list of shortcuts.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns


 A `glib::SList` of `gio::File` of the locations that have been added as
 application-specific shortcuts with `PlacesSidebar::add_shortcut`.
To free this list, you can use

```C
g_slist_free_full (list, (GDestroyNotify) g_object_unref);
```
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn remove_shortcut -->
Removes an application-specific shortcut that has been previously been
inserted with `PlacesSidebar::add_shortcut`. If the `location` is not a
shortcut in the sidebar, then nothing is done.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `location`
location to remove
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_local_only -->
Sets whether the `self` should only show local files.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `local_only`
whether to show only local files
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_location -->
Sets the location that is being shown in the widgets surrounding the
`self`, for example, in a folder view in a file manager. In turn, the
`self` will highlight that location if it is being shown in the list of
places, or it will unhighlight everything if the `location` is not among the
places in the list.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `location`
location to select, or `None` for no current path
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_open_flags -->
Sets the way in which the calling application can open new locations from
the places sidebar. For example, some applications only open locations
“directly” into their main view, while others may support opening locations
in a new notebook tab or a new window.

This function is used to tell the places `self` about the ways in which the
application can open new locations, so that the sidebar can display (or not)
the “Open in new tab” and “Open in new window” menu items as appropriate.

When the `PlacesSidebar::open-location` signal is emitted, its flags
argument will be set to one of the `flags` that was passed in
`PlacesSidebar::set_open_flags`.

Passing 0 for `flags` will cause `PlacesOpenFlags::Normal` to always be sent
to callbacks for the “open-location” signal.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `flags`
Bitmask of modes in which the calling application can open locations
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_show_connect_to_server -->
Sets whether the `self` should show an item for connecting to a network server; this is off by default.
An application may want to turn this on if it implements a way for the user to connect
to network servers directly.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `show_connect_to_server`
whether to show an item for the Connect to Server command
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_show_desktop -->
Sets whether the `self` should show an item for the Desktop folder.
The default value for this option is determined by the desktop
environment and the user’s configuration, but this function can be
used to override it on a per-application basis.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `show_desktop`
whether to show an item for the Desktop folder
<!-- impl PlacesSidebar::fn set_show_enter_location -->
Sets whether the `self` should show an item for connecting to a network server; this is off by default.
An application may want to turn this on if it implements a way for the user to connect
to network servers directly.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `show_enter_location`
whether to show an item for the Connect to Server command
<!-- enum PolicyType -->
Determines how the size should be computed to achieve the one of the
visibility mode for the scrollbars.
<!-- enum PolicyType::variant Always -->
The scrollbar is always visible. The view size is
 independent of the content.
<!-- enum PolicyType::variant Automatic -->
The scrollbar will appear and disappear as necessary.
 For example, when all of a `TreeView` can not be seen.
<!-- enum PolicyType::variant Never -->
The scrollbar should never appear. In this mode the
 content determines the size.
<!-- enum PolicyType::variant External -->
Don't show a scrollbar, but don't force the
 size to follow the content. This can be used e.g. to make multiple
 scrolled windows share a scrollbar. Since: 3.16
<!-- struct Popover -->
`Popover` is a bubble-like context window, primarily meant to
provide context-dependent information or options. Popovers are
attached to a widget, passed at construction time on `Popover::new`,
or updated afterwards through `PopoverExt::set_relative_to`, by
default they will point to the whole widget area, although this
behavior can be changed through `PopoverExt::set_pointing_to`.

The position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to
can also be changed through `PopoverExt::set_position`.

By default, `Popover` performs a GTK+ grab, in order to ensure
input events get redirected to it while it is shown, and also so
the popover is dismissed in the expected situations (clicks outside
the popover, or the Esc key being pressed). If no such modal behavior
is desired on a popover, `PopoverExt::set_modal` may be called on it
to tweak its behavior.

## `Popover` as menu replacement

`Popover` is often used to replace menus. To facilitate this, it
supports being populated from a `gio::MenuModel`, using
`Popover::new_from_model`. In addition to all the regular menu
model features, this function supports rendering sections in the
model in a more compact form, as a row of icon buttons instead of
menu items.

To use this rendering, set the ”display-hint” attribute of the
section to ”horizontal-buttons” and set the icons of your items
with the ”verb-icon” attribute.


```text
<section>
  <attribute name="display-hint">horizontal-buttons</attribute>
  <item>
    <attribute name="label">Cut</attribute>
    <attribute name="action">app.cut</attribute>
    <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-cut-symbolic</attribute>
  </item>
  <item>
    <attribute name="label">Copy</attribute>
    <attribute name="action">app.copy</attribute>
    <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-copy-symbolic</attribute>
  </item>
  <item>
    <attribute name="label">Paste</attribute>
    <attribute name="action">app.paste</attribute>
    <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-paste-symbolic</attribute>

<!-- impl Popover::fn new -->
Creates a new popover to point to `relative_to`

Feature: `v3_12`

## `relative_to`
`Widget` the popover is related to

# Returns

a new `Popover`
<!-- impl Popover::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a `Popover` and populates it according to
`model`. The popover is pointed to the `relative_to` widget.

The created buttons are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the popover belongs - typically
by means of being attached to a widget that is contained within
the ``GtkApplicationWindows`` widget hierarchy.

Actions can also be added using `Widget::insert_action_group`
on the menus attach widget or on any of its parent widgets.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `relative_to`
`Widget` the popover is related to
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

the new `Popover`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn bind_model -->
Establishes a binding between a `Popover` and a `gio::MenuModel`.

The contents of `self` are removed and then refilled with menu items
according to `model`. When `model` changes, `self` is updated.
Calling this function twice on `self` with different `model` will
cause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the new
model. If `model` is `None` then any previous binding is undone and
all children are removed.

If `action_namespace` is non-`None` then the effect is as if all
actions mentioned in the `model` have their names prefixed with the
namespace, plus a dot. For example, if the action “quit” is
mentioned and `action_namespace` is “app” then the effective action
name is “app.quit”.

This function uses `Actionable` to define the action name and
target values on the created menu items. If you want to use an
action group other than “app” and “win”, or if you want to use a
`MenuShell` outside of a `ApplicationWindow`, then you will need
to attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy using
`Widget::insert_action_group`. As an example, if you created a
group with a “quit” action and inserted it with the name “mygroup”
then you would use the action name “mygroup.quit” in your
`gio::MenuModel`.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `model`
the `gio::MenuModel` to bind to or `None` to remove
 binding
## `action_namespace`
the namespace for actions in `model`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the popover is modal, see gtk_popover_set_modal to
see the implications of this.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

`true` if `self` is modal
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_pointing_to -->
If a rectangle to point to has been set, this function will
return `true` and fill in `rect` with such rectangle, otherwise
it will return `false` and fill in `rect` with the attached
widget coordinates.
## `rect`
location to store the rectangle

# Returns

`true` if a rectangle to point to was set.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_position -->
Returns the preferred position of `self`.

# Returns

The preferred position.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_relative_to -->
Returns the widget `self` is currently attached to

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_transitions_enabled -->
Returns whether show/hide transitions are enabled on this popover.

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

`true` if the show and hide transitions of the given
 popover are enabled, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets whether `self` is modal, a modal popover will grab all input
within the toplevel and grab the keyboard focus on it when being
displayed. Clicking outside the popover area or pressing Esc will
dismiss the popover and ungrab input.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `modal`
`true` to make popover claim all input within the toplevel
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_pointing_to -->
Sets the rectangle that `self` will point to, in the
coordinate space of the widget `self` is attached to,
see `PopoverExt::set_relative_to`.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `rect`
rectangle to point to
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_position -->
Sets the preferred position for `self` to appear. If the `self`
is currently visible, it will be immediately updated.

This preference will be respected where possible, although
on lack of space (eg. if close to the window edges), the
`Popover` may choose to appear on the opposite side

Feature: `v3_12`

## `position`
preferred popover position
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_relative_to -->
Sets a new widget to be attached to `self`. If `self` is
visible, the position will be updated.

Note: the ownership of popovers is always given to their `relative_to`
widget, so if `relative_to` is set to `None` on an attached `self`, it
will be detached from its previous widget, and consequently destroyed
unless extra references are kept.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `relative_to`
a `Widget`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_transitions_enabled -->
Sets whether show/hide transitions are enabled on this popover

Feature: `v3_16`

## `transitions_enabled`
Whether transitions are enabled
<!-- struct PopoverMenu -->
`PopoverMenu` is a subclass of `Popover` that treats its
childen like menus and allows switching between them. It is
meant to be used primarily together with `ModelButton`, but
any widget can be used, such as `SpinButton` or `Scale`.
In this respect, `PopoverMenu` is more flexible than popovers
that are created from a `gio::MenuModel` with `Popover::new_from_model`.

To add a child as a submenu, set the `PopoverMenu:submenu`
child property to the name of the submenu. To let the user open
this submenu, add a `ModelButton` whose `ModelButton:menu-name`
property is set to the name you've given to the submenu.

By convention, the first child of a submenu should be a `ModelButton`
to switch back to the parent menu. Such a button should use the
`ModelButton:inverted` and `ModelButton:centered` properties
to achieve a title-like appearance and place the submenu indicator
at the opposite side. To switch back to the main menu, use "main"
as the menu name.

# Example


```text

Opens a submenu of the `self`. The `name`
must be one of the names given to the submenus
of `self` with `PopoverMenu:submenu`, or
"main" to switch back to the main menu.

`ModelButton` will open submenus automatically

<!-- struct PrintSettings -->
A `PrintSettings` object represents the settings of a print dialog in
a system-independent way. The main use for this object is that once
you’ve printed you can get a settings object that represents the settings
the user chose, and the next time you print you can pass that object in so
that the user doesn’t have to re-set all his settings.

Its also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can easily save
the settings for the next time your app runs, or even store them in a
document. The predefined keys try to use shared values as much as possible
so that moving such a document between systems still works.

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- enum PrintStatus -->
The status gives a rough indication of the completion of a running
print operation.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Initial -->
The printing has not started yet; this
 status is set initially, and while the print dialog is shown.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Preparing -->
This status is set while the begin-print
 signal is emitted and during pagination.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant GeneratingData -->
This status is set while the
 pages are being rendered.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant SendingData -->
The print job is being sent off to the
 printer.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Pending -->
The print job has been sent to the printer,
 but is not printed for some reason, e.g. the printer may be stopped.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant PendingIssue -->
Some problem has occurred during
 printing, e.g. a paper jam.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Printing -->
The printer is processing the print job.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Finished -->
The printing has been completed successfully.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant FinishedAborted -->
The printing has been aborted.
<!-- struct ProgressBar -->
The `ProgressBar` is typically used to display the progress of a long
running operation. It provides a visual clue that processing
is underway. The `ProgressBar` can be used in two different
modes: percentage mode and activity mode.

When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
(e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
progress, it can use the `ProgressBar` in percentage mode and the user
sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that has
been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
`ProgressBar::set_fraction` periodically to update the progress bar.

When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
to do, it can use the `ProgressBar` in activity mode, which shows
activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
this mode, the application is required to call `ProgressBar::pulse`
periodically to update the progress bar.

There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
of the `ProgressBar`. Functions are provided to control the
orientation of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with
the bar, and the step size used in activity mode can be set.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `ProgressBar`.

# Returns

a `ProgressBar`.
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_ellipsize -->
Returns the ellipsizing position of the progress bar.
See `ProgressBar::set_ellipsize`.

# Returns

`pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_fraction -->
Returns the current fraction of the task that’s been completed.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `ProgressBar::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the progress bar is inverted
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_pulse_step -->
Retrieves the pulse step set with `ProgressBar::set_pulse_step`.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_show_text -->
Gets the value of the `ProgressBar:show-text` property.
See `ProgressBar::set_show_text`.

# Returns

`true` if text is shown in the progress bar
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the text displayed superimposed on the progress bar,
if any, otherwise `None`. The return value is a reference
to the text, not a copy of it, so will become invalid
if you change the text in the progress bar.

# Returns

text, or `None`; this string is owned by the widget
and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn pulse -->
Indicates that some progress has been made, but you don’t know how much.
Causes the progress bar to enter “activity mode,” where a block
bounces back and forth. Each call to `ProgressBar::pulse`
causes the block to move by a little bit (the amount of movement
per pulse is determined by `ProgressBar::set_pulse_step`).
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") the text
if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_fraction -->
Causes the progress bar to “fill in” the given fraction
of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_inverted -->
Progress bars normally grow from top to bottom or left to right.
Inverted progress bars grow in the opposite direction.
## `inverted`
`true` to invert the progress bar
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_pulse_step -->
Sets the fraction of total progress bar length to move the
bouncing block for each call to `ProgressBar::pulse`.
## `fraction`
fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show text superimposed
over the bar. The shown text is either the value of
the `ProgressBar:text` property or, if that is `None`,
the `ProgressBar:fraction` value, as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for containing
text (even if the actual text is blank), set `ProgressBar:show-text` to
`true` and `ProgressBar:text` to the empty string (not `None`).
## `show_text`
whether to show superimposed text
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_text -->
Causes the given `text` to appear superimposed on the progress bar.

If `text` is `None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the current
value of `ProgressBar:fraction` will be displayed as a percentage.

If `text` is non-`None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the text will
be displayed. In this case, it will not display the progress percentage.
If `text` is the empty string, the progress bar will still be styled and sized
suitably for containing text, as long as `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`.
## `text`
a UTF-8 string, or `None`
<!-- enum PropagationPhase -->
Describes the stage at which events are fed into a `EventController`.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant None -->
Events are not delivered automatically. Those can be
 manually fed through `EventControllerExt::handle_event`. This should
 only be used when full control about when, or whether the controller
 handles the event is needed.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Capture -->
Events are delivered in the capture phase. The
 capture phase happens before the bubble phase, runs from the toplevel down
 to the event widget. This option should only be used on containers that
 might possibly handle events before their children do.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Bubble -->
Events are delivered in the bubble phase. The bubble
 phase happens after the capture phase, and before the default handlers
 are run. This phase runs from the event widget, up to the toplevel.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Target -->
Events are delivered in the default widget event handlers,
 note that widget implementations must chain up on button, motion, touch and
 grab broken handlers for controllers in this phase to be run.

Feature: `v3_14`

<!-- struct RadioButton -->
A single radio button performs the same basic function as a `CheckButton`,
as its position in the object hierarchy reflects. It is only when multiple
radio buttons are grouped together that they become a different user
interface component in their own right.

Every radio button is a member of some group of radio buttons. When one is
selected, all other radio buttons in the same group are deselected. A
`RadioButton` is one way of giving the user a choice from many options.

Radio button widgets are created with `RadioButton::new`, passing `None`
as the argument if this is the first radio button in a group. In subsequent
calls, the group you wish to add this button to should be passed as an
argument. Optionally, `RadioButton::new_with_label` can be used if you
want a text label on the radio button.

Alternatively, when adding widgets to an existing group of radio buttons,
use `RadioButton::new_from_widget` with a `RadioButton` that already
has a group assigned to it. The convenience function
`RadioButton::new_with_label_from_widget` is also provided.

To retrieve the group a `RadioButton` is assigned to, use
`RadioButton::get_group`.

To remove a `RadioButton` from one group and make it part of a new one,
use `RadioButton::set_group`.

The group list does not need to be freed, as each `RadioButton` will remove
itself and its list item when it is destroyed.

## How to create a group of two radio buttons.


```C
void create_radio_buttons (void) {

   GtkWidget *window, *radio1, *radio2, *box, *entry;
   window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
   box = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 2);
   gtk_box_set_homogeneous (GTK_BOX (box), TRUE);

   // Create a radio button with a GtkEntry widget
   radio1 = gtk_radio_button_new (NULL);
   entry = gtk_entry_new ();
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (radio1), entry);


   // Create a radio button with a label
   radio2 = gtk_radio_button_new_with_label_from_widget (GTK_RADIO_BUTTON (radio1),
                                                         "I’m the second radio button.");

   // Pack them into a box, then show all the widgets
   gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), radio1, TRUE, TRUE, 2);
   gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), radio2, TRUE, TRUE, 2);
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), box);
   gtk_widget_show_all (window);
   return;
}
```

When an unselected button in the group is clicked the clicked button
receives the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal, as does the previously
selected button.
Inside the `ToggleButton::toggled` handler, `ToggleButton::get_active`
can be used to determine if the button has been selected or deselected.

# Returns

a new radio button.
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` containing a label, adding it to the same
group as `group`. The label will be created using
`Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores in `label` indicate the
mnemonic for the button.
## `group`
the radio button
 group, or `None`
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `RadioButton`
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_mnemonic_from_widget -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the button.
## `radio_group_member`
widget to get radio group from or `None`
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `RadioButton`
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn get_group -->
Retrieves the group assigned to a radio button.

# Returns

a linked list
containing all the radio buttons in the same group
as `self`. The returned list is owned by the radio button
and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn join_group -->
Joins a `RadioButton` object to the group of another `RadioButton` object

Use this in language bindings instead of the `RadioButton::get_group`
and `RadioButton::set_group` methods

A common way to set up a group of radio buttons is the following:

```C
  GtkRadioButton *radio_button;
  GtkRadioButton *last_button;

  while ( ...more buttons to add... )
    {
       radio_button = gtk_radio_button_new (...);

       gtk_radio_button_join_group (radio_button, last_button);
       last_button = radio_button;
    }
```
## `group_source`
a radio button object whos group we are
 joining, or `None` to remove the radio button from its group
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn set_group -->
Sets a `RadioButton`’s group. It should be noted that this does not change
the layout of your interface in any way, so if you are changing the group,
it is likely you will need to re-arrange the user interface to reflect these
changes.
## `group`
an existing radio
 button group, such as one returned from `RadioButton::get_group`, or `None`.
<!-- struct Range -->
`Range` is the common base class for widgets which visualize an
adjustment, e.g `Scale` or `Scrollbar`.

Apart from signals for monitoring the parameters of the adjustment,
`Range` provides properties and methods for influencing the sensitivity
of the “steppers”. It also provides properties and methods for setting a
“fill level” on range widgets. See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.

# Implements

[`RangeExt`](trait.RangeExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt -->
Trait containing all `Range` methods.

# Implementors

[`Range`](struct.Range.html), [`Scale`](struct.Scale.html), [`Scrollbar`](struct.Scrollbar.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_adjustment -->
Get the `Adjustment` which is the “model” object for `Range`.
See `RangeExt::set_adjustment` for details.
The return value does not have a reference added, so should not
be unreferenced.

# Returns

a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_fill_level -->
Gets the current position of the fill level indicator.

# Returns

The current fill level
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_flippable -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_flippable`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is inverted
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_lower_stepper_sensitivity -->
Gets the sensitivity policy for the stepper that points to the
'lower' end of the `Range`’s adjustment.

# Returns

The lower stepper’s sensitivity policy.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_min_slider_size -->
This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.

See `RangeExt::set_min_slider_size`.

# Returns

The minimum size of the range’s slider.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_range_rect -->
This function returns the area that contains the range’s trough
and its steppers, in widget->window coordinates.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `range_rect`
return location for the range rectangle
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range is restricted to the fill level.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is restricted to the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_round_digits -->
Gets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.

# Returns

the number of digits to round to
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_show_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range displays the fill level graphically.

# Returns

`true` if `self` shows the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_range -->
This function returns sliders range along the long dimension,
in widget->window coordinates.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `slider_start`
return location for the slider's
 start, or `None`
## `slider_end`
return location for the slider's
 end, or `None`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_size_fixed -->
This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.

See `RangeExt::set_slider_size_fixed`.

# Returns

whether the range’s slider has a fixed size.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_upper_stepper_sensitivity -->
Gets the sensitivity policy for the stepper that points to the
'upper' end of the `Range`’s adjustment.

# Returns

The upper stepper’s sensitivity policy.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the range.

# Returns

current value of the range.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment to be used as the “model” object for this range
widget. The adjustment indicates the current range value, the
minimum and maximum range values, the step/page increments used
for keybindings and scrolling, and the page size. The page size
is normally 0 for `Scale` and nonzero for `Scrollbar`, and
indicates the size of the visible area of the widget being scrolled.
The page size affects the size of the scrollbar slider.
## `adjustment`
a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_fill_level -->
Set the new position of the fill level indicator.

The “fill level” is probably best described by its most prominent
use case, which is an indicator for the amount of pre-buffering in
a streaming media player. In that use case, the value of the range
would indicate the current play position, and the fill level would
be the position up to which the file/stream has been downloaded.

This amount of prebuffering can be displayed on the range’s trough
and is themeable separately from the trough. To enable fill level
display, use `RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`. The range defaults
to not showing the fill level.

Additionally, it’s possible to restrict the range’s slider position
to values which are smaller than the fill level. This is controller
by `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level` and is by default
enabled.
## `fill_level`
the new position of the fill level indicator
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_flippable -->
If a range is flippable, it will switch its direction if it is
horizontal and its direction is `TextDirection::Rtl`.

See `Widget::get_direction`.
## `flippable`
`true` to make the range flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_increments -->
Sets the step and page sizes for the range.
The step size is used when the user clicks the `Scrollbar`
arrows or moves `Scale` via arrow keys. The page size
is used for example when moving via Page Up or Page Down keys.
## `step`
step size
## `page`
page size
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_inverted -->
Ranges normally move from lower to higher values as the
slider moves from top to bottom or left to right. Inverted
ranges have higher values at the top or on the right rather than
on the bottom or left.
## `setting`
`true` to invert the range
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_lower_stepper_sensitivity -->
Sets the sensitivity policy for the stepper that points to the
'lower' end of the `Range`’s adjustment.
## `sensitivity`
the lower stepper’s sensitivity policy.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_min_slider_size -->
Sets the minimum size of the range’s slider.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `min_size`
The slider’s minimum size
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_range -->
Sets the allowable values in the `Range`, and clamps the range
value to be between `min` and `max`. (If the range has a non-zero
page size, it is clamped between `min` and `max` - page-size.)
## `min`
minimum range value
## `max`
maximum range value
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Sets whether the slider is restricted to the fill level. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `restrict_to_fill_level`
Whether the fill level restricts slider movement.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_round_digits -->
Sets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.
## `round_digits`
the precision in digits, or -1
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_show_fill_level -->
Sets whether a graphical fill level is show on the trough. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `show_fill_level`
Whether a fill level indicator graphics is shown.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_slider_size_fixed -->
Sets whether the range’s slider has a fixed size, or a size that
depends on its adjustment’s page size.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `size_fixed`
`true` to make the slider size constant
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_upper_stepper_sensitivity -->
Sets the sensitivity policy for the stepper that points to the
'upper' end of the `Range`’s adjustment.
## `sensitivity`
the upper stepper’s sensitivity policy.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the current value of the range; if the value is outside the
minimum or maximum range values, it will be clamped to fit inside
them. The range emits the `Range::value-changed` signal if the
value changes.
## `value`
new value of the range
<!-- enum RcTokenType -->

`RecentChooserDialog` is a dialog box suitable for displaying the recently
used documents. This widgets works by putting a `RecentChooserWidget` inside
a `Dialog`. It exposes the `RecentChooserIface` interface, so you can use
all the `RecentChooser` functions on the recent chooser dialog as well as
those for `Dialog`.

Note that `RecentChooserDialog` does not have any methods of its own.
Instead, you should use the functions that work on a `RecentChooser`.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkrecentchooser`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can use the following code to use
a `RecentChooserDialog` to select a recently used file:


```C
GtkWidget *dialog;
gint res;

dialog = gtk_recent_chooser_dialog_new ("Recent Documents",
                                        parent_window,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Open"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);

res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    GtkRecentInfo *info;
    GtkRecentChooser *chooser = GTK_RECENT_CHOOSER (dialog);

    info = gtk_recent_chooser_get_current_item (chooser);
    open_file (gtk_recent_info_get_uri (info));
    gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
  }

gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- impl RecentChooserDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new `RecentChooserDialog`. This function is analogous to
`Dialog::new_with_buttons`.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`,

This is useful if you have implemented your own recent manager, or if you
have a customized instance of a `RecentManager` object.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`,
## `manager`

`RecentChooser` functions.
<!-- enum RecentChooserError::variant NotFound -->
Indicates that a file does not exist
<!-- enum RecentChooserError::variant InvalidUri -->
Indicates a malformed URI
<!-- struct RecentChooserWidget -->
`RecentChooserWidget` is a widget suitable for selecting recently used
files. It is the main building block of a `RecentChooserDialog`. Most
applications will only need to use the latter; you can use
`RecentChooserWidget` as part of a larger window if you have special needs.

Note that `RecentChooserWidget` does not have any methods of its own.
Instead, you should use the functions that work on a `RecentChooser`.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- impl RecentChooserWidget::fn new -->
Creates a new `RecentChooserWidget` object. This is an embeddable widget
used to access the recently used resources list.

# Returns

<!-- impl RecentChooserWidget::fn new_for_manager -->
Creates a new `RecentChooserWidget` with a specified recent manager.

This is useful if you have implemented your own recent manager, or if you
have a customized instance of a `RecentManager` object.
## `manager`
a `RecentManager`

# Returns

a new `RecentChooserWidget`
<!-- struct RecentData -->
Meta-data to be passed to `RecentManager::add_full` when
registering a recently used resource.
<!-- struct RecentFilter -->
A `RecentFilter` can be used to restrict the files being shown
in a `RecentChooser`. Files can be filtered based on their name
(with `RecentFilter::add_pattern`), on their mime type (with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`), on the application that has
registered them (with `RecentFilter::add_application`), or by
a custom filter function (with `RecentFilter::add_custom`).

Filtering by mime type handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of text/plain.
Note that `RecentFilter` allows wildcards for the subtype of a
mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.

Normally, filters are used by adding them to a `RecentChooser`,
see `RecentChooser::add_filter`, but it is also possible to
manually use a filter on a file with `RecentFilter::filter`.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

## `RecentFilter` as `Buildable`

The `RecentFilter` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>`, `<patterns>` and
`<applications>` elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
a `<mime-type>`, `<pattern>` or `<application>` has the same effect as
calling `RecentFilter::add_mime_type`,
`RecentFilter::add_pattern` or `RecentFilter::add_application`.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying `RecentFilter` rules:

```text
<object class="GtkRecentFilter">
  <mime-types>
    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
    <mime-type>image/png</mime-type>
  </mime-types>
  <patterns>
    <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
    <pattern>*.png</pattern>
  </patterns>
  <applications>
    <application>gimp</application>
    <application>gedit</application>
    <application>glade</application>
  </applications>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl RecentFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new `RecentFilter` with no rules added to it.
Such filter does not accept any recently used resources, so is not
particularly useful until you add rules with
`RecentFilter::add_pattern`, `RecentFilter::add_mime_type`,
`RecentFilter::add_application`, `RecentFilter::add_age`.
To create a filter that accepts any recently used resource, use:

```C
GtkRecentFilter *filter = gtk_recent_filter_new ();
gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern (filter, "*");
```

# Returns

a new `RecentFilter`

Adds a rule that allows resources based on the name of the application
that has registered them.
## `application`

function. The bitfield `needed` which is passed in provides information
about what sorts of information that the filter function needs;
this allows GTK+ to avoid retrieving expensive information when
it isn’t needed by the filter.
## `needed`
bitfield of flags indicating the information that the custom
 filter function needs.
## `func`
callback function; if the function returns `true`, then
 the file will be displayed.
## `data`
data to pass to `func`
## `data_destroy`
function to call to free `data` when it is no longer needed.

<!-- struct RecentManager -->
`RecentManager` provides a facility for adding, removing and
looking up recently used files. Each recently used file is
identified by its URI, and has meta-data associated to it, like
the names and command lines of the applications that have
registered it, the number of time each application has registered
the same file, the mime type of the file and whether the file
should be displayed only by the applications that have
registered it.

The recently used files list is per user.

The `RecentManager` acts like a database of all the recently
used files. You can create new `RecentManager` objects, but
it is more efficient to use the default manager created by GTK+.

Adding a new recently used file is as simple as:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
gtk_recent_manager_add_item (manager, file_uri);
```

The `RecentManager` will try to gather all the needed information
from the file itself through GIO.

Looking up the meta-data associated with a recently used file
given its URI requires calling `RecentManager::lookup_item`:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;
GtkRecentInfo *info;
GError *error = NULL;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
info = gtk_recent_manager_lookup_item (manager, file_uri, &error);
if (error)
  {
    g_warning ("Could not find the file: %s", error->message);
    g_error_free (error);
  }
else
 {
   // Use the info object
   gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
 }
```

In order to retrieve the list of recently used files, you can use
`RecentManager::get_items`, which returns a list of `RecentInfo`-structs.

A `RecentManager` is the model used to populate the contents of
one, or more `RecentChooser` implementations.

Note that the maximum age of the recently used files list is
controllable through the `Settings:gtk-recent-files-max-age`
property.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn new -->
Creates a new recent manager object. Recent manager objects are used to
handle the list of recently used resources. A `RecentManager` object
monitors the recently used resources list, and emits the “changed” signal
each time something inside the list changes.

`RecentManager` objects are expensive: be sure to create them only when
needed. You should use `RecentManager::get_default` instead.

# Returns

A newly created `RecentManager` object
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn get_default -->
Gets a unique instance of `RecentManager`, that you can share
in your application without caring about memory management.

# Returns

A unique `RecentManager`. Do not ref or
 unref it.
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn add_full -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list, using the metadata specified inside the
`RecentData`-struct passed in `recent_data`.

The passed URI will be used to identify this resource inside the
list.

In order to register the new recently used resource, metadata about
the resource must be passed as well as the URI; the metadata is
stored in a `RecentData`-struct, which must contain the MIME
type of the resource pointed by the URI; the name of the application
that is registering the item, and a command line to be used when
launching the item.

Optionally, a `RecentData`-struct might contain a UTF-8 string
to be used when viewing the item instead of the last component of
the URI; a short description of the item; whether the item should
be considered private - that is, should be displayed only by the
applications that have registered it.
## `uri`
a valid URI
## `recent_data`
metadata of the resource

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added to the
 recently used resources list, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn add_item -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list.

This function automatically retrieves some of the needed
metadata and setting other metadata to common default values;
it then feeds the data to `RecentManager::add_full`.

See `RecentManager::add_full` if you want to explicitly
define the metadata for the resource pointed by `uri`.
## `uri`
a valid URI

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added
 to the recently used resources list
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn get_items -->

Checks whether there is a recently used resource registered
with `uri` inside the recent manager.
## `uri`
a URI

Searches for a URI inside the recently used resources list, and
returns a `RecentInfo`-struct containing informations about the resource
like its MIME type, or its display name.
## `uri`
a URI

# Returns

a `RecentInfo`-struct containing information
 about the resource pointed by `uri`, or `None` if the URI was
 not registered in the recently used resources list. Free with
 `RecentInfo::unref`.
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn move_item -->
Changes the location of a recently used resource from `uri` to `new_uri`.

Please note that this function will not affect the resource pointed
by the URIs, but only the URI used in the recently used resources list.
## `uri`
the URI of a recently used resource
## `new_uri`
the new URI of the recently used resource, or
 `None` to remove the item pointed by `uri` in the list

# Returns

`true` on success
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn purge_items -->
Purges every item from the recently used resources list.

# Returns

the number of items that have been removed from the
 recently used resources list
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn remove_item -->

<!-- struct Scale -->
A `Scale` is a slider control used to select a numeric value.
To use it, you’ll probably want to investigate the methods on
its base class, `Range`, in addition to the methods for `Scale` itself.
To set the value of a scale, you would normally use `RangeExt::set_value`.
To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the
`Range::value-changed` signal.

Note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the `Scale` (through
the `Range` methods) will hide the slider itself. This is useful for
applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale, without
changing the layout of the application (such as movie or music players).

# `Scale` as `Buildable`

`Scale` supports a custom `<marks>` element, which can contain multiple
`<mark>` elements. The “value” and “position” attributes have the same
meaning as `Scale::add_mark` parameters of the same name. If the
element is not empty, its content is taken as the markup to show at
the mark. It can be translated with the usual ”translatable” and
“context” attributes.

# Implements

[`RangeExt`](trait.RangeExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- impl Scale::fn new -->
Creates a new `Scale`.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `adjustment`
the `Adjustment` which sets the range
 of the scale, or `None` to create a new adjustment.

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- impl Scale::fn new_with_range -->
Creates a new scale widget with the given orientation that lets the
user input a number between `min` and `max` (including `min` and `max`)
with the increment `step`. `step` must be nonzero; it’s the distance
the slider moves when using the arrow keys to adjust the scale
value.

Note that the way in which the precision is derived works best if `step`
is a power of ten. If the resulting precision is not suitable for your
needs, use `Scale::set_digits` to correct it.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `min`
minimum value
## `max`
maximum value
## `step`
step increment (tick size) used with keyboard shortcuts

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- impl Scale::fn add_mark -->
Adds a mark at `value`.

A mark is indicated visually by drawing a tick mark next to the scale,
and GTK+ makes it easy for the user to position the scale exactly at the
marks value.

If `markup` is not `None`, text is shown next to the tick mark.

To remove marks from a scale, use `Scale::clear_marks`.
## `value`
the value at which the mark is placed, must be between
 the lower and upper limits of the scales’ adjustment
## `position`
where to draw the mark. For a horizontal scale, `PositionType::Top`
 and `PositionType::Left` are drawn above the scale, anything else below.
 For a vertical scale, `PositionType::Left` and `PositionType::Top` are drawn to
 the left of the scale, anything else to the right.
## `markup`
Text to be shown at the mark, using [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat], or `None`
<!-- impl Scale::fn clear_marks -->
Removes any marks that have been added with `Scale::add_mark`.
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_digits -->

the number of decimal places that are displayed
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_draw_value -->
Returns whether the current value is displayed as a string
next to the slider.

# Returns

whether the current value is displayed as a string
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_has_origin -->
Returns whether the scale has an origin.

# Returns

`true` if the scale has an origin.
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the scale. The returned
object is owned by the scale so does not need to be freed by
the caller.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this scale,
 or `None` if the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`.
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the scale will draw the
`pango::Layout` representing the text in the scale. Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` function you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.

If the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`, the return
values are undefined.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- impl Scale::fn get_value_pos -->
Gets the position in which the current value is displayed.

# Returns

the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- impl Scale::fn set_digits -->
Sets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value.
Also causes the value of the adjustment to be rounded off to this
number of digits, so the retrieved value matches the value the user saw.
## `digits`
the number of decimal places to display,
 e.g. use 1 to display 1.0, 2 to display 1.00, etc
<!-- impl Scale::fn set_draw_value -->
Specifies whether the current value is displayed as a string next
to the slider.
## `draw_value`
`true` to draw the value
<!-- impl Scale::fn set_has_origin -->
If `has_origin` is set to `true` (the default),
the scale will highlight the part of the scale
between the origin (bottom or left side) of the scale
and the current value.
## `has_origin`
`true` if the scale has an origin
<!-- impl Scale::fn set_value_pos -->
Sets the position in which the current value is displayed.
## `pos`
the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- struct ScaleButton -->
`ScaleButton` provides a button which pops up a scale widget.
This kind of widget is commonly used for volume controls in multimedia
applications, and GTK+ provides a `VolumeButton` subclass that
is tailored for this use case.

<!-- struct Scrollable -->
`Scrollable` is an interface that is implemented by widgets with native
scrolling ability.

To implement this interface you should override the
`Scrollable:hadjustment` and `Scrollable:vadjustment` properties.

## Creating a scrollable widget

All scrollable widgets should do the following.

- When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
 the widget should populate the adjustments’
 `Adjustment:lower`, `Adjustment:upper`,
 `Adjustment:step-increment`, `Adjustment:page-increment` and
 `Adjustment:page-size` properties and connect to the
 `Adjustment::value-changed` signal.

- Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
 the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
 This means that it must accept any value passed to its
 `WidgetClass.size_allocate`() function.

- When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
 the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.

- When any of the adjustments emits the `Adjustment::value-changed` signal,
 the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.

<!-- trait ScrollableExt::fn get_border -->
Returns the size of a non-scrolling border around the

<!-- struct Scrollbar -->
The `Scrollbar` widget is a horizontal or vertical scrollbar,
depending on the value of the `Orientable:orientation` property.

The position of the thumb in a scrollbar is controlled by the scroll
adjustments. See `Adjustment` for the fields in an adjustment - for
`Scrollbar`, the `Adjustment:value` field represents the position
of the scrollbar, which must be between the `Adjustment:lower` field
and `Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page-size`. The
`Adjustment:page-size` field represents the size of the visible
scrollable area. The `Adjustment:step-increment` and
`Adjustment:page-increment` fields are properties when the user asks to
step down (using the small stepper arrows) or page down (using for
example the `Page Down` key).

# Implements

[`RangeExt`](trait.RangeExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html)
<!-- impl Scrollbar::fn new -->
Creates a new scrollbar with the given orientation.
## `orientation`

# Returns

the new `Scrollbar`.
<!-- struct ScrolledWindow -->
`ScrolledWindow` is a `Bin` subclass: it’s a container
the accepts a single child widget. `ScrolledWindow` adds scrollbars
to the child widget and optionally draws a beveled frame around the
child widget.

The scrolled window can work in two ways. Some widgets have native
scrolling support; these widgets implement the `Scrollable` interface.
Widgets with native scroll support include `TreeView`, `TextView`,
and `Layout`.

For widgets that lack native scrolling support, the `Viewport`
widget acts as an adaptor class, implementing scrollability for child
widgets that lack their own scrolling capabilities. Use `Viewport`
to scroll child widgets such as `Grid`, `Box`, and so on.

If a widget has native scrolling abilities, it can be added to the
`ScrolledWindow` with `ContainerExt::add`. If a widget does not, you
must first add the widget to a `Viewport`, then add the `Viewport`
to the scrolled window. `ContainerExt::add` will do this for you for
widgets that don’t implement `Scrollable` natively, so you can
ignore the presence of the viewport.

The position of the scrollbars is controlled by the scroll adjustments.
See `Adjustment` for the fields in an adjustment — for
`Scrollbar`, used by `ScrolledWindow`, the “value” field
represents the position of the scrollbar, which must be between the
“lower” field and “upper - page_size.” The “page_size” field
represents the size of the visible scrollable area. The
“step_increment” and “page_increment” fields are used when the user
asks to step down (using the small stepper arrows) or page down (using
for example the PageDown key).

If a `ScrolledWindow` doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
your own scrolling with `Scrollbar` and for example a `Grid`.

# Touch support

`ScrolledWindow` has built-in support for touch devices. When a
touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
`ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling` property if it is undesired.

`ScrolledWindow` also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
captured with the `ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.

If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlayed as
narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
can be turned off with the `ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling`
property.

# Implements

[`ScrolledWindowExt`](trait.ScrolledWindowExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt -->
Trait containing all `ScrolledWindow` methods.

# Implementors

[`PlacesSidebar`](struct.PlacesSidebar.html), [`ScrolledWindow`](struct.ScrolledWindow.html)
<!-- impl ScrolledWindow::fn new -->
Creates a new scrolled window.

The two arguments are the scrolled window’s adjustments; these will be
shared with the scrollbars and the child widget to keep the bars in sync
with the child. Usually you want to pass `None` for the adjustments, which
will cause the scrolled window to create them for you.
## `hadjustment`
horizontal adjustment
## `vadjustment`
vertical adjustment

# Returns

a new scrolled window
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn add_with_viewport -->
Used to add children without native scrolling capabilities. This
is simply a convenience function; it is equivalent to adding the
unscrollable child to a viewport, then adding the viewport to the
scrolled window. If a child has native scrolling, use
`ContainerExt::add` instead of this function.

The viewport scrolls the child by moving its `gdk::Window`, and takes
the size of the child to be the size of its toplevel `gdk::Window`.
This will be very wrong for most widgets that support native scrolling;
for example, if you add a widget such as `TreeView` with a viewport,
the whole widget will scroll, including the column headings. Thus,
widgets with native scrolling support should not be used with the
`Viewport` proxy.

A widget supports scrolling natively if it implements the
`Scrollable` interface.

# Deprecated since 3.8

`ContainerExt::add` will automatically add
a `Viewport` if the child doesn’t implement `Scrollable`.
## `child`
the widget you want to scroll
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_capture_button_press -->

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

`true` if overlay scrolling is enabled
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_placement -->
Gets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars
for the scrolled window. See `ScrolledWindowExt::set_placement`.

# Returns

the current placement value.

See also `ScrolledWindowExt::set_placement` and
`ScrolledWindowExt::unset_placement`.
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_policy -->
Retrieves the current policy values for the horizontal and vertical
scrollbars. See `ScrolledWindowExt::set_policy`.
## `hscrollbar_policy`
location to store the policy
 for the horizontal scrollbar, or `None`
## `vscrollbar_policy`
location to store the policy
 for the vertical scrollbar, or `None`
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_shadow_type -->

vertical scrollbar to the child widget’s vertical scroll functionality.

# Returns

the vertical `Adjustment`
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_vscrollbar -->
Returns the vertical scrollbar of `self`.

# Returns

the vertical scrollbar of the scrolled window.
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_capture_button_press -->
Changes the behaviour of `self` wrt. to the initial
event that possibly starts kinetic scrolling. When `capture_button_press`
is set to `true`, the event is captured by the scrolled window, and
then later replayed if it is meant to go to the child widget.

This should be enabled if any child widgets perform non-reversible
actions on `Widget::button-press-event`. If they don't, and handle
additionally handle `Widget::grab-broken-event`, it might be better
to set `capture_button_press` to `false`.

This setting only has an effect if kinetic scrolling is enabled.
## `capture_button_press`
`true` to capture button presses
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_hadjustment -->
Sets the `Adjustment` for the horizontal scrollbar.
## `hadjustment`
horizontal scroll adjustment
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_kinetic_scrolling -->

Kinetic scrolling only applies to devices with source
`gdk::InputSource::Touchscreen`.
## `kinetic_scrolling`
`true` to enable kinetic scrolling
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_min_content_height -->
Sets the minimum height that `self` should keep visible.
Note that this can and (usually will) be smaller than the minimum
size of the content.
## `height`
the minimal content height
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_min_content_width -->
Sets the minimum width that `self` should keep visible.
Note that this can and (usually will) be smaller than the minimum
size of the content.
## `width`
the minimal content width
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_overlay_scrolling -->
Enables or disables overlay scrolling for this scrolled window.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `overlay_scrolling`
whether to enable overlay scrolling
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_placement -->
Sets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars
for the scrolled window.

The default is `CornerType::TopLeft`, meaning the child is
in the top left, with the scrollbars underneath and to the right.
Other values in `CornerType` are `CornerType::TopRight`,
`CornerType::BottomLeft`, and `CornerType::BottomRight`.

See also `ScrolledWindowExt::get_placement` and
`ScrolledWindowExt::unset_placement`.
## `window_placement`
position of the child window
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_policy -->
Sets the scrollbar policy for the horizontal and vertical scrollbars.

The policy determines when the scrollbar should appear; it is a value
from the `PolicyType` enumeration. If `PolicyType::Always`, the
scrollbar is always present; if `PolicyType::Never`, the scrollbar is
never present; if `PolicyType::Automatic`, the scrollbar is present only
if needed (that is, if the slider part of the bar would be smaller
than the trough — the display is larger than the page size).
## `hscrollbar_policy`
policy for horizontal bar
## `vscrollbar_policy`
policy for vertical bar
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_shadow_type -->
Changes the type of shadow drawn around the contents of
`self`.
## `type_`
kind of shadow to draw around scrolled window contents
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_vadjustment -->
Sets the `Adjustment` for the vertical scrollbar.
## `vadjustment`
vertical scroll adjustment
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn unset_placement -->
Unsets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars
for the scrolled window. If no window placement is set for a scrolled
window, it defaults to `CornerType::TopLeft`.

See also `ScrolledWindowExt::set_placement` and
`ScrolledWindowExt::get_placement`.
<!-- struct SearchBar -->
`SearchBar` is a container made to have a search entry (possibly
with additional connex widgets, such as drop-down menus, or buttons)
built-in. The search bar would appear when a search is started through
typing on the keyboard, or the application’s search mode is toggled on.

For keyboard presses to start a search, events will need to be
forwarded from the top-level window that contains the search bar.
See `SearchBar::handle_event` for example code. Common shortcuts
such as Ctrl+F should be handled as an application action, or through
the menu items.

You will also need to tell the search bar about which entry you
are using as your search entry using `SearchBar::connect_entry`.
The following example shows you how to create a more complex search
entry.

## Creating a search bar

[A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/search-bar.c)

Feature: `v3_10`

# Implements

[`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn new -->
Creates a `SearchBar`. You will need to tell it about
which widget is going to be your text entry using
`SearchBar::connect_entry`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

a new `SearchBar`
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn connect_entry -->
Connects the `Entry` widget passed as the one to be used in
this search bar. The entry should be a descendant of the search bar.
This is only required if the entry isn’t the direct child of the
search bar (as in our main example).

Feature: `v3_10`

## `entry`
a `Entry`
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn get_search_mode -->
Returns whether the search mode is on or off.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

whether search mode is toggled on
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn get_show_close_button -->
Returns whether the close button is shown.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

whether the close button is shown
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn handle_event -->
This function should be called when the top-level
window which contains the search bar received a key event.

If the key event is handled by the search bar, the bar will
be shown, the entry populated with the entered text and `GDK_EVENT_STOP`
will be returned. The caller should ensure that events are
not propagated further.

If no entry has been connected to the search bar, using
`SearchBar::connect_entry`, this function will return
immediately with a warning.

## Showing the search bar on key presses


```C
static gboolean
on_key_press_event (GtkWidget *widget,
                    GdkEvent  *event,
                    gpointer   user_data)
{
  GtkSearchBar *bar = GTK_SEARCH_BAR (user_data);
  return gtk_search_bar_handle_event (bar, event);
}

g_signal_connect (window,
                 "key-press-event",
                  G_CALLBACK (on_key_press_event),
                  search_bar);
```

Feature: `v3_10`

## `event`
a ``GdkEvent`` containing key press events

# Returns

`GDK_EVENT_STOP` if the key press event resulted
 in text being entered in the search entry (and revealing
 the search bar if necessary), `GDK_EVENT_PROPAGATE` otherwise.
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_search_mode -->
Switches the search mode on or off.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `search_mode`
the new state of the search mode
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_show_close_button -->
Shows or hides the close button. Applications that
already have a “search” toggle button should not show a close
button in their search bar, as it duplicates the role of the
toggle button.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `visible`
whether the close button will be shown or not
<!-- struct SearchEntry -->
`SearchEntry` is a subclass of `Entry` that has been
tailored for use as a search entry.

It will show an inactive symbolic “find” icon when the search
entry is empty, and a symbolic “clear” icon when there is text.
Clicking on the “clear” icon will empty the search entry.

Note that the search/clear icon is shown using a secondary
icon, and thus does not work if you are using the secondary
icon position for some other purpose.

To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to
not react to every change in the entry text immediately, but
only after a short delay. To support this, `SearchEntry`
emits the `SearchEntry::search-changed` signal which can
be used instead of the `Editable::changed` signal.

The `SearchEntry::previous-match`, `SearchEntry::next-match`
and `SearchEntry::stop-search` signals can be uesd to implement
moving between search results and ending the search.

Often, `SearchEntry` will be fed events by means of being
placed inside a `SearchBar`. If that is not the case,
you can use `SearchEntry::handle_event` to pass events.

Feature: `v3_6`

# Implements

[`EntryExt`](trait.EntryExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`CellEditableExt`](trait.CellEditableExt.html), [`EditableExt`](trait.EditableExt.html)
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn new -->
Creates a `SearchEntry`, with a find icon when the search field is
empty, and a clear icon when it isn't.

Feature: `v3_6`


# Returns

a new `SearchEntry`
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn handle_event -->
This function should be called when the top-level window
which contains the search entry received a key event. If
the entry is part of a `SearchBar`, it is preferable
to call `SearchBar::handle_event` instead, which will
reveal the entry in addition to passing the event to this
function.

If the key event is handled by the search entry and starts
or continues a search, `GDK_EVENT_STOP` will be returned.
The caller should ensure that the entry is shown in this
case, and not propagate the event further.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `event`

`GDK_EVENT_STOP` if the key press event resulted
 in a search beginning or continuing, `GDK_EVENT_PROPAGATE`
 otherwise.

Creates a new `Separator` with the given orientation.
## `orientation`
the separator’s orientation.

# Returns

a new `Separator`.
<!-- struct SeparatorMenuItem -->
The `SeparatorMenuItem` is a separator used to group
items within a menu. It displays a horizontal line with a shadow to
make it appear sunken into the interface.

# Implements

[`MenuItemExt`](trait.MenuItemExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html)
<!-- impl SeparatorMenuItem::fn new -->
Creates a new `SeparatorMenuItem`.

# Returns

a new `SeparatorMenuItem`.
<!-- struct SeparatorToolItem -->
A `SeparatorToolItem` is a `ToolItem` that separates groups of other
``GtkToolItems``. Depending on the theme, a `SeparatorToolItem` will
often look like a vertical line on horizontally docked toolbars.

If the `Toolbar` child property “expand” is `true` and the property
`SeparatorToolItem:draw` is `false`, a `SeparatorToolItem` will act as
a “spring” that forces other items to the ends of the toolbar.

Use `SeparatorToolItem::new` to create a new `SeparatorToolItem`.

# Implements

<!-- impl SeparatorToolItem::fn new -->
Create a new `SeparatorToolItem`

# Returns

the new `SeparatorToolItem`
<!-- impl SeparatorToolItem::fn get_draw -->
Returns whether `self` is drawn as a line, or just blank.
See `SeparatorToolItem::set_draw`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is drawn as a line, or just blank.
<!-- impl SeparatorToolItem::fn set_draw -->
Whether `self` is drawn as a vertical line, or just blank.
Setting this to `false` along with `ToolItem::set_expand` is useful
to create an item that forces following items to the end of the toolbar.
## `draw`
whether `self` is drawn as a vertical line
<!-- struct Settings -->
`Settings` provide a mechanism to share global settings between
applications.

On the X window system, this sharing is realized by an
[XSettings](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec)
manager that is usually part of the desktop environment, along with
utilities that let the user change these settings. In the absence of
an Xsettings manager, GTK+ reads default values for settings from
`settings.ini` files in
`/etc/gtk-3.0`, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gtk-3.0`
and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0`.
These files must be valid key files (see `glib::KeyFile`), and have
a section called Settings. Themes can also provide default values
for settings by installing a `settings.ini` file
next to their `gtk.css` file.

Applications can override system-wide settings by setting the property
of the `Settings` object with `gobject::Object::set`. This should be restricted
to special cases though; `Settings` are not meant as an application
configuration facility. When doing so, you need to be aware that settings
that are specific to individual widgets may not be available before the
widget type has been realized at least once. The following example
demonstrates a way to do this:

```C
  gtk_init (&argc, &argv);

  // make sure the type is realized
  g_type_class_unref (g_type_class_ref (GTK_TYPE_IMAGE_MENU_ITEM));

  g_object_set (gtk_settings_get_default (), "gtk-enable-animations", FALSE, NULL);
```

There is one `Settings` instance per screen. It can be obtained with
`Settings::get_for_screen`, but in many cases, it is more convenient
to use `Widget::get_settings`. `Settings::get_default` returns the
`Settings` instance for the default screen.

# Implements

<!-- impl Settings::fn get_default -->
Gets the `Settings` object for the default GDK screen, creating
it if necessary. See `Settings::get_for_screen`.

# Returns

 screen, then returns `None`.
<!-- impl Settings::fn get_for_screen -->
Gets the `Settings` object for `screen`, creating it if necessary.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`.

# Returns

a `Settings` object.
<!-- impl Settings::fn install_property -->

<!-- enum ShadowType -->
Used to change the appearance of an outline typically provided by a `Frame`.

Note that many themes do not differentiate the appearance of the
various shadow types: Either their is no visible shadow (`ShadowType::None`),
or there is (any other value).
<!-- enum ShadowType::variant None -->
No outline.
<!-- enum ShadowType::variant In -->
The outline is bevelled inwards.
<!-- enum ShadowType::variant Out -->
The outline is bevelled outwards like a button.
<!-- enum ShadowType::variant EtchedIn -->
The outline has a sunken 3d appearance.
<!-- enum ShadowType::variant EtchedOut -->
The outline has a raised 3d appearance.
<!-- struct SizeGroup -->
`SizeGroup` provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets
together so they all request the same amount of space. This is
typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same
size, but you can’t use a `Grid` widget.

In detail, the size requested for each widget in a `SizeGroup` is
the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
of the size group (see `SizeGroup::set_mode`) determines whether
this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.

Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
a `SizeGroup` to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
such a way that they get the size they request and not more. For
example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
include the `AttachOptions::Fill` flag.

`SizeGroup` objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
so once you have added all widgets to a `SizeGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the size group with `gobject::Object::unref`. If the
widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
freed.

Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK+ will compute the
horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
of type `SizeGroupMode::Horizontal` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`, and the
vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
`SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`.

Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
trade height for width in mode `SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`:
the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
width for height widgets.

Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum width
by way of `Label:width-chars` for instance. Widgets with static sizes as well
as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no such considerations.

# `SizeGroup` as `Buildable`

Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `SizeGroup`:

```text
<object class="GtkSizeGroup">
  <property name="mode">GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL</property>
  <widgets>
    <widget name="radio1"/>
    <widget name="radio2"/>
  </widgets>
</object>
```

<!-- impl SizeGroup::fn new -->
Create a new `SizeGroup`.
## `mode`
the mode for the new size group.

# Returns

a newly created `SizeGroup`
<!-- impl SizeGroup::fn add_widget -->
Adds a widget to a `SizeGroup`. In the future, the requisition
of the widget will be determined as the maximum of its requisition
and the requisition of the other widgets in the size group.
Whether this applies horizontally, vertically, or in both directions
depends on the mode of the size group. See `SizeGroup::set_mode`.

When the widget is destroyed or no longer referenced elsewhere, it will
be removed from the size group.
## `widget`
the `Widget` to add
<!-- impl SizeGroup::fn get_ignore_hidden -->

<!-- impl SizeGroup::fn set_ignore_hidden -->
Sets whether unmapped widgets should be ignored when
calculating the size.
## `ignore_hidden`
whether unmapped widgets should be ignored
 when calculating the size

Sets the `SizeGroupMode` of the size group. The mode of the size
group determines whether the widgets in the size group should
all have the same horizontal requisition (`SizeGroupMode::Horizontal`)
all have the same vertical requisition (`SizeGroupMode::Vertical`),
or should all have the same requisition in both directions
(`SizeGroupMode::Both`).
## `mode`

<!-- struct SpinButton -->
A `SpinButton` is an ideal way to allow the user to set the value of
some attribute. Rather than having to directly type a number into a
`Entry`, `SpinButton` allows the user to click on one of two arrows
to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be
typed in, with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a
given range.

The main properties of a `SpinButton` are through an adjustment.
See the `Adjustment` section for more details about an adjustment's
properties.

## Using a `SpinButton` to get an integer


```C
// Provides a function to retrieve an integer value from a GtkSpinButton
// and creates a spin button to model percentage values.

gint
grab_int_value (GtkSpinButton *button,
                gpointer       user_data)
{
  return gtk_spin_button_get_value_as_int (button);
}

<!-- struct Stack -->
The `Stack` widget is a container which only shows
one of its children at a time. In contrast to `Notebook`,
`Stack` does not provide a means for users to change the
visible child. Instead, the `StackSwitcher` widget can be
used with `Stack` to provide this functionality.

Transitions between pages can be animated as slides or
fades. This can be controlled with `Stack::set_transition_type`.
These animations respect the `Settings:gtk-enable-animations`
setting.

The `Stack` widget was added in GTK+ 3.10.

<!-- struct StackSwitcher -->
The `StackSwitcher` widget acts as a controller for a
`Stack`; it shows a row of buttons to switch between
the various pages of the associated stack widget.

All the content for the buttons comes from the child properties
of the `Stack`.

It is possible to associate multiple `StackSwitcher` widgets
with the same stack widget.

The `StackSwitcher` widget was added in 3.10.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- enum StateType -->
This type indicates the current state of a widget; the state determines how
the widget is drawn. The `StateType` enumeration is also used to
identify different colors in a `Style` for drawing, so states can be
used for subparts of a widget as well as entire widgets.

# Deprecated since 3.14

All APIs that are using this enumeration have been deprecated
 in favor of alternatives using `StateFlags`.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Normal -->
State during normal operation.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Active -->
State of a currently active widget, such as a depressed button.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Prelight -->
State indicating that the mouse pointer is over
 the widget and the widget will respond to mouse clicks.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Selected -->
State of a selected item, such the selected row in a list.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Insensitive -->
State indicating that the widget is
 unresponsive to user actions.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Inconsistent -->
The widget is inconsistent, such as checkbuttons
 or radiobuttons that aren’t either set to `true` nor `false`,
 or buttons requiring the user attention.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Focused -->
The widget has the keyboard focus.
<!-- struct StatusIcon -->
`[Deprecated since 3.14]` The “system tray” or notification area is normally used for transient icons
that indicate some special state. For example, a system tray icon might
appear to tell the user that they have new mail, or have an incoming instant
message, or something along those lines. The basic idea is that creating an
icon in the notification area is less annoying than popping up a dialog.

A `StatusIcon` object can be used to display an icon in a “system tray”.
The icon can have a tooltip, and the user can interact with it by
activating it or popping up a context menu. Critical information should
not solely be displayed in a `StatusIcon`, since it may not be
visible (e.g. when the user doesn’t have a notification area on his panel).
This can be checked with `StatusIcon::is_embedded`.

On X11, the implementation follows the
[FreeDesktop System Tray Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/systemtray-spec).
Implementations of the “tray” side of this specification can
be found e.g. in the GNOME 2 and KDE panel applications.

Note that a `StatusIcon` is not a widget, but just
a `gobject::Object`. Making it a widget would be impractical, since the system tray
on Win32 doesn’t allow to embed arbitrary widgets.

`StatusIcon` has been deprecated in 3.14. You should consider using
notifications or more modern platform-specific APIs instead. GLib provides
the `gio::Notification` API which works well with `Application`. Also see this
[HowDoI](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GNotification).

<!-- struct Statusbar -->
A `Statusbar` is usually placed along the bottom of an application's
main `Window`. It may provide a regular commentary of the application's
status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be
used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
is complete in an FTP client, for example).

Status bars in GTK+ maintain a stack of messages. The message at
the top of the each bar’s stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

Any messages added to a statusbar’s stack must specify a
context id that is used to uniquely identify
the source of a message. This context id can be generated by
`Statusbar::get_context_id`, given a message and the statusbar that
it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a stack, and when
choosing which message to display, the stack structure is adhered to,
regardless of the context identifier of a message.

One could say that a statusbar maintains one stack of messages for
display purposes, but allows multiple message producers to maintain
sub-stacks of the messages they produced (via context ids).

Status bars are created using `Statusbar::new`.

Messages are added to the bar’s stack with `Statusbar::push`.

The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
`Statusbar::pop`. A message can be removed from anywhere in the
stack if its message id was recorded at the time it was added. This
is done using `Statusbar::remove`.

# Implements

 the new message is being used in

# Returns

an integer id
<!-- impl Statusbar::fn get_message_area -->
Retrieves the box containing the label widget.

# Returns

a `Box`
<!-- impl Statusbar::fn pop -->
Removes the first message in the `Statusbar`’s stack

Note that this may not change the displayed message, if
the message at the top of the stack has a different
context id.
## `context_id`
a context identifier
<!-- impl Statusbar::fn push -->
Pushes a new message onto a statusbar’s stack.
## `context_id`

# Returns

a message id that can be used with
 `Statusbar::remove`.
<!-- impl Statusbar::fn remove -->

## `message_id`
a message identifier, as returned by `Statusbar::push`
<!-- impl Statusbar::fn remove_all -->
Forces the removal of all messages from a statusbar's
stack with the exact `context_id`.
## `context_id`

<!-- struct StyleContext -->
`StyleContext` is an object that stores styling information affecting
a widget defined by `WidgetPath`.

In order to construct the final style information, `StyleContext`
queries information from all attached ``GtkStyleProviders``. Style providers
can be either attached explicitly to the context through
`StyleContext::add_provider`, or to the screen through
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_screen`. The resulting style is a
combination of all providers’ information in priority order.

For GTK+ widgets, any `StyleContext` returned by
`Widget::get_style_context` will already have a `WidgetPath`, a
`gdk::Screen` and RTL/LTR information set. The style context will be also
updated automatically if any of these settings change on the widget.

If you are using the theming layer standalone, you will need to set a
widget path and a screen yourself to the created style context through
`StyleContext::set_path` and `StyleContext::set_screen`, as well
as updating the context yourself using `StyleContext::invalidate`
whenever any of the conditions change, such as a change in the
`Settings:gtk-theme-name` setting or a hierarchy change in the rendered
widget.

# Style Classes # {`gtkstylecontext`-classes}

Widgets can add style classes to their context, which can be used
to associate different styles by class
(see [Selectors][gtkcssprovider-selectors]).

# Style Regions

Widgets can also add regions with flags to their context. This feature is
deprecated and will be removed in a future GTK+ update. Please use style
classes instead.

The regions used by GTK+ widgets are:

## row
Used by `TreeView`. Can be used with the flags: `even`, `odd`.

## column
Used by `TreeView`. Can be used with the flags: `first`, `last`, `sorted`.

## column-header
Used by `TreeView`.

## tab
Used by `Notebook`. Can be used with the flags: `even`, `odd`, `first`, `last`.

# Custom styling in UI libraries and applications

If you are developing a library with custom ``GtkWidgets`` that
render differently than standard components, you may need to add a
`StyleProvider` yourself with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK`
priority, either a `CssProvider` or a custom object implementing the
`StyleProvider` interface. This way themes may still attempt
to style your UI elements in a different way if needed so.

If you are using custom styling on an applications, you probably want then
to make your style information prevail to the theme’s, so you must use
a `StyleProvider` with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`
priority, keep in mind that the user settings in
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/gtk.css` will
still take precedence over your changes, as it uses the
`GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER` priority.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn new -->
Creates a standalone `StyleContext`, this style context
won’t be attached to any widget, so you may want
to call `StyleContext::set_path` yourself.

This function is only useful when using the theming layer
separated from GTK+, if you are using `StyleContext` to
theme ``GtkWidgets``, use `Widget::get_style_context`
in order to get a style context ready to theme the widget.

# Returns

A newly created `StyleContext`.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_provider_for_screen -->
Adds a global style provider to `screen`, which will be used
in style construction for all ``GtkStyleContexts`` under `screen`.

GTK+ uses this to make styling information from `Settings`
available.

Note: If both priorities are the same, A `StyleProvider`
added through `StyleContext::add_provider` takes precedence
over another added through this function.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn remove_provider_for_screen -->
Removes `provider` from the global style providers list in `screen`.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn reset_widgets -->
This function recomputes the styles for all widgets under a particular
`gdk::Screen`. This is useful when some global parameter has changed that
affects the appearance of all widgets, because when a widget gets a new
style, it will both redraw and recompute any cached information about
its appearance. As an example, it is used when the color scheme changes
in the related `Settings` object.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_class -->
Adds a style class to `self`, so posterior calls to
`StyleContext::get` or any of the gtk_render_*()
functions will make use of this new class for styling.

In the CSS file format, a `Entry` defining an “entry”
class, would be matched by:


```text
GtkEntry.entry { ... }
```

While any widget defining an “entry” class would be
matched by:

```text
.entry { ... }
```
## `class_name`
class name to use in styling
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_provider -->
Adds a style provider to `self`, to be used in style construction.
Note that a style provider added by this function only affects
the style of the widget to which `self` belongs. If you want
to affect the style of all widgets, use
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_screen`.

Note: If both priorities are the same, a `StyleProvider`
added through this function takes precedence over another added
through `StyleContext::add_provider_for_screen`.
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_region -->
Adds a region to `self`, so posterior calls to
`StyleContext::get` or any of the gtk_render_*()
functions will make use of this new region for styling.

In the CSS file format, a `TreeView` defining a “row”
region, would be matched by:


```text
GtkTreeView row { ... }
```

Pseudo-classes are used for matching `flags`, so the two
following rules:

```text
GtkTreeView row:nth-child(even) { ... }
GtkTreeView row:nth-child(odd) { ... }
```

would apply to even and odd rows, respectively.

Region names must only contain lowercase letters
and “-”, starting always with a lowercase letter.

# Deprecated since 3.14

## `region_name`
region name to use in styling
## `flags`
flags that apply to the region
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn cancel_animations -->
Stops all running animations for `region_id` and all animatable
regions underneath.

A `None` `region_id` will stop all ongoing animations in `self`,
when dealing with a `StyleContext` obtained through
`Widget::get_style_context`, this is normally done for you
in all circumstances you would expect all widget to be stopped,
so this should be only used in complex widgets with different
animatable regions.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function does nothing.
## `region_id`
animatable region to stop, or `None`.
 See `StyleContext::push_animatable_region`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn get -->
Retrieves several style property values from `self` for a
given state.
## `state`
state to retrieve the property values for
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn get_background_color -->
Gets the background color for a given state.

This function is far less useful than it seems, and it should not be used in
newly written code. CSS has no concept of "background color", as a background
can be an image, or a gradient, or any other pattern including solid colors.

The only reason why you would call `StyleContext::get_background_color` is
to use the returned value to draw the background with it; the correct way to
achieve this result is to use `gtk_render_background` instead, along with CSS
style classes to modify the color to be rendered.

<!-- impl StyleContext::fn get_section -->
Queries the location in the CSS where `property` was defined for the
current `self`. Note that the state to be queried is taken from
`StyleContext::get_state`.

If the location is not available, `None` will be returned. The
location might not be available for various reasons, such as the
property being overridden, `property` not naming a supported CSS

reasons.

Shorthand CSS properties cannot be queried for a location and will
always return `None`.

again. It is useful if you modify the `self` and need the new
information immediately.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Style contexts are invalidated automatically.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn list_classes -->
Returns the list of classes currently defined in `self`.

<!-- impl StyleContext::fn lookup_icon_set -->
Looks up `stock_id` in the icon factories associated to `self` and
the default icon factory, returning an icon set if found, otherwise
`None`.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `IconTheme::lookup_icon` instead.
## `stock_id`
an icon name

# Returns

The looked up `IconSet`, or `None`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn notify_state_change -->
Notifies a state change on `self`, so if the current style makes use
of transition animations, one will be started so all rendered elements
under `region_id` are animated for state `state` being set to value
`state_value`.

The `window` parameter is used in order to invalidate the rendered area
as the animation runs, so make sure it is the same window that is being
rendered on by the gtk_render_*() functions.

If `region_id` is `None`, all rendered elements using `self` will be
affected by this state transition.

As a practical example, a `Button` notifying a state transition on
the prelight state:

```C
gtk_style_context_notify_state_change (context,
                                       gtk_widget_get_window (widget),
                                       NULL,
                                       GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT,
                                       button->in_button);
```

Can be handled in the CSS file like this:

```text
GtkButton {
    background-color: #f00
}

GtkButton:hover {
    background-color: #fff;
    transition: 200ms linear
}
```

This combination will animate the button background from red to white
if a pointer enters the button, and back to red if the pointer leaves
the button.

Note that `state` is used when finding the transition parameters, which
is why the style places the transition under the :hover pseudo-class.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function does nothing.
## `window`
a `gdk::Window`
## `region_id`
animatable region to notify on, or `None`.
 See `StyleContext::push_animatable_region`

`true` if `state` is the state we are changing to,
 `false` if we are changing away from it
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn pop_animatable_region -->
Pops an animatable region from `self`.
See `StyleContext::push_animatable_region`.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function does nothing.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn push_animatable_region -->
Pushes an animatable region, so all further gtk_render_*() calls between
this call and the following `StyleContext::pop_animatable_region`
will potentially show transition animations for this region if
`StyleContext::notify_state_change` is called for a given state,
and the current theme/style defines transition animations for state
changes.

The `region_id` used must be unique in `self` so the themes
can uniquely identify rendered elements subject to a state transition.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function does nothing.
## `region_id`
unique identifier for the animatable region
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn remove_class -->
Removes `class_name` from `self`.

See `StyleContext::save`.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn save -->
Saves the `self` state, so temporary modifications done through
`StyleContext::add_class`, `StyleContext::remove_class`,
`StyleContext::set_state`, etc. can quickly be reverted
in one go through `StyleContext::restore`.

The matching call to `StyleContext::restore` must be done
before GTK returns to the main loop.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn scroll_animations -->
This function is analogous to `gdk::Window::scroll`, and
should be called together with it so the invalidation
areas for any ongoing animation are scrolled together
with it.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function does nothing.
## `window`
a `gdk::Window` used previously in
 `StyleContext::notify_state_change`
## `dx`
Amount to scroll in the X axis

the new direction.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_frame_clock -->
Attaches `self` to the given frame clock.

The frame clock is used for the timing of animations.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`Widget::get_style_context`, you do not need to
call this yourself.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `frame_clock`
a `gdk::FrameClock`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_junction_sides -->
Sets the sides where rendered elements (mostly through
`gtk_render_frame`) will visually connect with other visual elements.

This is merely a hint that may or may not be honored
by themes.

Container widgets are expected to set junction hints as appropriate
for their children, so it should not normally be necessary to call
this function manually.
## `sides`
sides where rendered elements are visually connected to
 other elements
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_parent -->
Sets the parent style context for `self`. The parent style
context is used to implement
[inheritance](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/`inheritance`)
of properties.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`Widget::get_style_context`, the parent will be set for you.
## `parent`
the new parent or `None`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_path -->
Sets the `WidgetPath` used for style matching. As a
consequence, the style will be regenerated to match
the new given path.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`Widget::get_style_context`, you do not need to call
this yourself.
## `path`
a `WidgetPath`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_scale -->
Sets the scale to use when getting image assets for the style .

Feature: `v3_10`

## `scale`
scale
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_screen -->
Attaches `self` to the given screen.

The screen is used to add style information from “global” style
providers, such as the screens `Settings` instance.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`Widget::get_style_context`, you do not need to
call this yourself.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn set_state -->
Sets the state to be used when rendering with any
of the gtk_render_*() functions.
## `flags`
state to represent
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn state_is_running -->
Returns `true` if there is a transition animation running for the
current region (see `StyleContext::push_animatable_region`).

If `progress` is not `None`, the animation progress will be returned
there, 0.0 means the state is closest to being unset, while 1.0 means
it’s closest to being set. This means transition animation will
run from 0 to 1 when `state` is being set and from 1 to 0 when
it’s being unset.

# Deprecated since 3.6

This function always returns `false`
## `state`
a widget state
## `progress`
return location for the transition progress

# Returns

`true` if there is a running transition animation for `state`.
<!-- struct StyleProvider -->
`StyleProvider` is an interface used to provide style information to a `StyleContext`.
See `StyleContext::add_provider` and `StyleContext::add_provider_for_screen`.

# Implements

[`StyleProviderExt`](trait.StyleProviderExt.html)

# Returns

The icon factory to use for `path`, or `None`
<!-- trait StyleProviderExt::fn get_style -->
Returns the style settings affecting a widget defined by `path`, or `None` if
`self` doesn’t contemplate styling `path`.

# Deprecated since 3.8

Will always return `None` for all GTK-provided style providers
 as the interface cannot correctly work the way CSS is specified.
## `path`
`WidgetPath` to query

# Returns

a `StyleProperties` containing the
style settings affecting `path`

`true` if the property was found and has a value, `false` otherwise
<!-- struct Switch -->
`Switch` is a widget that has two states: on or off. The user can control
which state should be active by clicking the empty area, or by dragging the
handle.

`Switch` can also handle situations where the underlying state changes with
a delay. See `Switch::state-set` for details.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html)
<!-- impl Switch::fn new -->
Creates a new `Switch` widget.

# Returns

Changes the state of `self` to the desired one.
## `is_active`
`true` if `self` should be active, and `false` otherwise
<!-- impl Switch::fn set_state -->
Sets the underlying state of the `Switch`.

Normally, this is the same as `Switch:active`, unless the switch
is set up for delayed state changes. This function is typically
called from a `Switch::state-set` signal handler.

See `Switch::state-set` for details.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `state`
the new state
<!-- struct TextAttributes -->
Using `TextAttributes` directly should rarely be necessary.
It’s primarily useful with `TextIter::get_attributes`.
As with most GTK+ structs, the fields in this struct should only
be read, never modified directly.
<!-- impl TextAttributes::fn new -->
Creates a `TextAttributes`, which describes
a set of properties on some text.

# Returns

a new `TextAttributes`,
 free with `TextAttributes::unref`.
<!-- impl TextAttributes::fn copy -->
Copies `self` and returns a new `TextAttributes`.

# Returns

a copy of `self`,
 free with `TextAttributes::unref`
<!-- impl TextAttributes::fn copy_values -->
Copies the values from `self` to `dest` so that `dest` has
the same values as `self`. Frees existing values in `dest`.
## `dest`
another `TextAttributes`
<!-- impl TextAttributes::fn ref -->
Increments the reference count on `self`.

# Returns

the `TextAttributes` that were passed in
<!-- impl TextAttributes::fn unref -->
Decrements the reference count on `self`, freeing the structure
if the reference count reaches 0.
<!-- struct TextBuffer -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn new -->
Creates a new text buffer.
## `table`
a tag table, or `None` to create a new one

# Returns

a new text buffer
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn add_mark -->
Adds the mark at position `where_`. The mark must not be added to
another buffer, and if its name is not `None` then there must not
be another mark in the buffer with the same name.

Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal as notification of the mark's
initial placement.
## `mark`
the mark to add
## `where_`
location to place mark
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn add_selection_clipboard -->
Adds `clipboard` to the list of clipboards in which the selection
contents of `self` are available. In most cases, `clipboard` will be
the `Clipboard` of type `GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY` for a view of `self`.
## `clipboard`
a `Clipboard`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn apply_tag -->
Emits the “apply-tag” signal on `self`. The default
handler for the signal applies `tag` to the given range.
`start` and `end` do not have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn apply_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTable::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBuffer::apply_tag`.
## `name`
name of a named `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn backspace -->
Performs the appropriate action as if the user hit the delete
key with the cursor at the position specified by `iter`. In the
normal case a single character will be deleted, but when
combining accents are involved, more than one character can
be deleted, and when precomposed character and accent combinations
are involved, less than one character will be deleted.

Because the buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become
invalid after calling this function; however, the `iter` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

`true` if the buffer was modified
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn begin_user_action -->
Called to indicate that the buffer operations between here and a
call to `TextBuffer::end_user_action` are part of a single
user-visible operation. The operations between
`TextBuffer::begin_user_action` and
`TextBuffer::end_user_action` can then be grouped when creating
an undo stack. `TextBuffer` maintains a count of calls to
`TextBuffer::begin_user_action` that have not been closed with
a call to `TextBuffer::end_user_action`, and emits the
“begin-user-action” and “end-user-action” signals only for the
outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions
from other user actions.

The “interactive” buffer mutation functions, such as
`TextBuffer::insert_interactive`, automatically call begin/end
user action around the buffer operations they perform, so there's
no need to add extra calls if you user action consists solely of a
single call to one of those functions.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn copy_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard.
## `clipboard`
the `Clipboard` object to copy to
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn create_child_anchor -->
This is a convenience function which simply creates a child anchor
with `TextChildAnchor::new` and inserts it into the buffer
with `TextBuffer::insert_child_anchor`. The new anchor is
owned by the buffer; no reference count is returned to
the caller of `TextBuffer::create_child_anchor`.
## `iter`
location in the buffer

# Returns

the created child anchor
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn create_mark -->
Creates a mark at position `where_`. If `mark_name` is `None`, the mark
is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name using
`TextBuffer::get_mark`. If a mark has left gravity, and text is
inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark will be moved to
the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity
(`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the right of
newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark
with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).

The caller of this function does not own a
reference to the returned `TextMark`, so you can ignore the
return value if you like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go
away when the buffer does.

Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal as notification of the mark's
initial placement.
## `mark_name`
name for mark, or `None`
## `where_`
location to place mark
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark has left gravity

# Returns

the new `TextMark` object
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn create_tag -->
Creates a tag and adds it to the tag table for `self`.
Equivalent to calling `TextTag::new` and then adding the
tag to the buffer’s tag table. The returned tag is owned by
the buffer’s tag table, so the ref count will be equal to one.

If `tag_name` is `None`, the tag is anonymous.

If `tag_name` is non-`None`, a tag called `tag_name` must not already
exist in the tag table for this buffer.

The `first_property_name` argument and subsequent arguments are a list
of properties to set on the tag, as with `gobject::Object::set`.
## `tag_name`
name of the new tag, or `None`
## `first_property_name`
name of first property to set, or `None`

# Returns

a new tag
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn cut_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard, then deletes
said text if it’s editable.
## `clipboard`
the `Clipboard` object to cut to
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn delete -->
Deletes text between `start` and `end`. The order of `start` and `end`
is not actually relevant; `TextBuffer::delete` will reorder
them. This function actually emits the “delete-range” signal, and
the default handler of that signal deletes the text. Because the
buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid after
calling this function; however, the `start` and `end` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `start`
a position in `self`
## `end`
another position in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn delete_interactive -->
Deletes all editable text in the given range.
Calls `TextBuffer::delete` for each editable sub-range of
[`start`,`end`). `start` and `end` are revalidated to point to
the location of the last deleted range, or left untouched if
no text was deleted.
## `start_iter`
start of range to delete
## `end_iter`
end of range
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether some text was actually deleted
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn delete_mark -->
Deletes `mark`, so that it’s no longer located anywhere in the
buffer. Removes the reference the buffer holds to the mark, so if
you haven’t called `gobject::Object::ref` on the mark, it will be freed. Even
if the mark isn’t freed, most operations on `mark` become
invalid, until it gets added to a buffer again with
`TextBuffer::add_mark`. Use `TextMark::get_deleted` to
find out if a mark has been removed from its buffer.
The `TextBuffer::mark-deleted` signal will be emitted as notification after
the mark is deleted.
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn delete_mark_by_name -->
Deletes the mark named `name`; the mark must exist. See
`TextBuffer::delete_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn delete_selection -->
Deletes the range between the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks,
that is, the currently-selected text. If `interactive` is `true`,
the editability of the selection will be considered (users can’t delete
uneditable text).
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether there was a non-empty selection to delete
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn deserialize -->
This function deserializes rich text in format `format` and inserts
it at `iter`.

`formats` to be used must be registered using
`TextBuffer::register_deserialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_deserialize_tagset` beforehand.
## `content_buffer`
the `TextBuffer` to deserialize into
## `format`
the rich text format to use for deserializing
## `iter`
insertion point for the deserialized text
## `data`
data to deserialize
## `length`
length of `data`

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` otherwise.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn deserialize_get_can_create_tags -->
This functions returns the value set with
`TextBuffer::deserialize_set_can_create_tags`
## `format`
a `gdk::Atom` representing a registered rich text format

# Returns

whether deserializing this format may create tags
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn deserialize_set_can_create_tags -->
Use this function to allow a rich text deserialization function to
create new tags in the receiving buffer. Note that using this
function is almost always a bad idea, because the rich text
functions you register should know how to map the rich text format
they handler to your text buffers set of tags.

The ability of creating new (arbitrary!) tags in the receiving buffer
is meant for special rich text formats like the internal one that
is registered using `TextBuffer::register_deserialize_tagset`,
because that format is essentially a dump of the internal structure
of the source buffer, including its tag names.

You should allow creation of tags only if you know what you are
doing, e.g. if you defined a tagset name for your application
suite’s text buffers and you know that it’s fine to receive new
tags from these buffers, because you know that your application can
handle the newly created tags.
## `format`
a `gdk::Atom` representing a registered rich text format
## `can_create_tags`
whether deserializing this format may create tags
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn end_user_action -->
Should be paired with a call to `TextBuffer::begin_user_action`.
See that function for a full explanation.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_bounds -->
Retrieves the first and last iterators in the buffer, i.e. the
entire buffer lies within the range [`start`,`end`).
## `start`
iterator to initialize with first position in the buffer
## `end`
iterator to initialize with the end iterator
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_char_count -->
Gets the number of characters in the buffer; note that characters
and bytes are not the same, you can’t e.g. expect the contents of
the buffer in string form to be this many bytes long. The character
count is cached, so this function is very fast.

# Returns

number of characters in the buffer
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_copy_target_list -->
This function returns the list of targets this text buffer can
provide for copying and as DND source. The targets in the list are
added with `info` values from the `TextBufferTargetInfo` enum,
using `TargetList::add_rich_text_targets` and
`TargetList::add_text_targets`.

# Returns

the `TargetList`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_deserialize_formats -->
This function returns the rich text deserialize formats registered
with `self` using `TextBuffer::register_deserialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_deserialize_tagset`
## `n_formats`
return location for the number of formats

# Returns

an array of
 ``GdkAtoms`` representing the registered formats.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_end_iter -->
Initializes `iter` with the “end iterator,” one past the last valid
character in the text buffer. If dereferenced with
`TextIter::get_char`, the end iterator has a character value of 0.
The entire buffer lies in the range from the first position in
the buffer (call `TextBuffer::get_start_iter` to get
character position 0) to the end iterator.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_has_selection -->
Indicates whether the buffer has some text currently selected.

# Returns

`true` if the there is text selected
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_insert -->
Returns the mark that represents the cursor (insertion point).
Equivalent to calling `TextBuffer::get_mark` to get the mark
named “insert”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves less
typing.

# Returns

insertion point mark
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_child_anchor -->
Obtains the location of `anchor` within `self`.
## `iter`
an iterator to be initialized
## `anchor`
a child anchor that appears in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_line -->
Initializes `iter` to the start of the given line. If `line_number` is greater
than the number of lines in the `self`, the end iterator is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_line_index -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `byte_index` within the given line.
`byte_index` must be the start of a UTF-8 character, and must not be
beyond the end of the line. Note bytes, not
characters; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `byte_index`
byte index from start of line
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_line_offset -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `char_offset` within the given
line. The `char_offset` must exist, offsets off the end of the line
are not allowed. Note characters, not bytes;
UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of line
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_mark -->
Initializes `iter` with the current position of `mark`.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_iter_at_offset -->
Initializes `iter` to a position `char_offset` chars from the start
of the entire buffer. If `char_offset` is -1 or greater than the number
of characters in the buffer, `iter` is initialized to the end iterator,
the iterator one past the last valid character in the buffer.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of buffer, counting from 0, or -1
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_line_count -->
Obtains the number of lines in the buffer. This value is cached, so
the function is very fast.

# Returns

number of lines in the buffer
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_mark -->
Returns the mark named `name` in buffer `self`, or `None` if no such
mark exists in the buffer.
## `name`
a mark name

# Returns

a `TextMark`, or `None`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_modified -->
Indicates whether the buffer has been modified since the last call
to `TextBuffer::set_modified` set the modification flag to
`false`. Used for example to enable a “save” function in a text
editor.

# Returns

`true` if the buffer has been modified
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_paste_target_list -->
This function returns the list of targets this text buffer supports
for pasting and as DND destination. The targets in the list are
added with `info` values from the `TextBufferTargetInfo` enum,
using `TargetList::add_rich_text_targets` and
`TargetList::add_text_targets`.

# Returns

the `TargetList`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_selection_bound -->
Returns the mark that represents the selection bound. Equivalent
to calling `TextBuffer::get_mark` to get the mark named
“selection_bound”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves
less typing.

The currently-selected text in `self` is the region between the
“selection_bound” and “insert” marks. If “selection_bound” and
“insert” are in the same place, then there is no current selection.
`TextBuffer::get_selection_bounds` is another convenient function
for handling the selection, if you just want to know whether there’s a
selection and what its bounds are.

# Returns

selection bound mark
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Returns `true` if some text is selected; places the bounds
of the selection in `start` and `end` (if the selection has length 0,
then `start` and `end` are filled in with the same value).
`start` and `end` will be in ascending order. If `start` and `end` are
NULL, then they are not filled in, but the return value still indicates
whether text is selected.
## `start`
iterator to initialize with selection start
## `end`
iterator to initialize with selection end

# Returns

whether the selection has nonzero length
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_serialize_formats -->
This function returns the rich text serialize formats registered
with `self` using `TextBuffer::register_serialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_tagset`
## `n_formats`
return location for the number of formats

# Returns

an array of
 ``GdkAtoms`` representing the registered formats.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. The returned string includes a
0xFFFC character whenever the buffer contains
embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBuffer::get_text`. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf or
widget is in the buffer.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_start_iter -->
Initialized `iter` with the first position in the text buffer. This
is the same as using `TextBuffer::get_iter_at_offset` to get
the iter at character offset 0.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_tag_table -->
Get the `TextTagTable` associated with this buffer.

# Returns

the buffer’s tag table
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn get_text -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. Does not include characters
representing embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do not correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBuffer::get_slice`.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert -->
Inserts `len` bytes of `text` at position `iter`. If `len` is -1,
`text` must be nul-terminated and will be inserted in its
entirety. Emits the “insert-text” signal; insertion actually occurs
in the default handler for the signal. `iter` is invalidated when
insertion occurs (because the buffer contents change), but the
default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
inserted text.
## `iter`
a position in the buffer
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_at_cursor -->
Simply calls `TextBuffer::insert`, using the current
cursor position as the insertion point.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text, in bytes
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_child_anchor -->
Inserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at `iter`. The
anchor will be counted as one character in character counts, and
when obtaining the buffer contents as a string, will be represented
by the Unicode “object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the
“slice” variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string
include this character for child anchors, but the “text” variants do
not. E.g. see `TextBuffer::get_slice` and
`TextBuffer::get_text`. Consider
`TextBuffer::create_child_anchor` as a more convenient
alternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference to
the anchor, so you can unref it after insertion.
## `iter`
location to insert the anchor
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_interactive -->
Like `TextBuffer::insert`, but the insertion will not occur if
`iter` is at a non-editable location in the buffer. Usually you
want to prevent insertions at ineditable locations if the insertion
results from a user action (is interactive).

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextView::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `text`
some UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_interactive_at_cursor -->
Calls `TextBuffer::insert_interactive` at the cursor
position.

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextView::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_markup -->
Inserts the text in `markup` at position `iter`. `markup` will be inserted
in its entirety and must be nul-terminated and valid UTF-8. Emits the
`TextBuffer::insert-text` signal, possibly multiple times; insertion
actually occurs in the default handler for the signal. `iter` will point
to the end of the inserted text on return.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `iter`
location to insert the markup
## `markup`
a nul-terminated UTF-8 string containing [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat]
## `len`
length of `markup` in bytes, or -1
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_pixbuf -->
Inserts an image into the text buffer at `iter`. The image will be
counted as one character in character counts, and when obtaining
the buffer contents as a string, will be represented by the Unicode
“object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the “slice”
variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string include
this character for pixbufs, but the “text” variants do
not. e.g. see `TextBuffer::get_slice` and
`TextBuffer::get_text`.
## `iter`
location to insert the pixbuf
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_range -->
Copies text, tags, and pixbufs between `start` and `end` (the order
of `start` and `end` doesn’t matter) and inserts the copy at `iter`.
Used instead of simply getting/inserting text because it preserves
images and tags. If `start` and `end` are in a different buffer from
`self`, the two buffers must share the same tag table.

Implemented via emissions of the insert_text and apply_tag signals,
so expect those.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_range_interactive -->
Same as `TextBuffer::insert_range`, but does nothing if the
insertion point isn’t editable. The `default_editable` parameter
indicates whether the text is editable at `iter` if no tags
enclosing `iter` affect editability. Typically the result of
`TextView::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer

# Returns

whether an insertion was possible at `iter`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_with_tags -->
Inserts `text` into `self` at `iter`, applying the list of tags to
the newly-inserted text. The last tag specified must be `None` to
terminate the list. Equivalent to calling `TextBuffer::insert`,
then `TextBuffer::apply_tag` on the inserted text;
`TextBuffer::insert_with_tags` is just a convenience function.
## `iter`
an iterator in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag`
first tag to apply to `text`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn insert_with_tags_by_name -->
Same as `TextBuffer::insert_with_tags`, but allows you
to pass in tag names instead of tag objects.
## `iter`
position in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag_name`
name of a tag to apply to `text`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn move_mark -->
Moves `mark` to the new location `where_`. Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set`
signal as notification of the move.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `where_`
new location for `mark` in `self`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn move_mark_by_name -->
Moves the mark named `name` (which must exist) to location `where_`.
See `TextBuffer::move_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark
## `where_`
new location for mark
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn paste_clipboard -->
Pastes the contents of a clipboard. If `override_location` is `None`, the
pasted text will be inserted at the cursor position, or the buffer selection
will be replaced if the selection is non-empty.

Note: pasting is asynchronous, that is, we’ll ask for the paste data and
return, and at some point later after the main loop runs, the paste data will
be inserted.
## `clipboard`
the `Clipboard` to paste from
## `override_location`
location to insert pasted text, or `None`
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn place_cursor -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them to the same place in two steps
with `TextBuffer::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `where_`
where to put the cursor
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn register_deserialize_format -->
This function registers a rich text deserialization `function` along with
its `mime_type` with the passed `self`.
## `mime_type`
the format’s mime-type
## `function`
the deserialize function to register
## `user_data`
`function`’s user_data
## `user_data_destroy`
a function to call when `user_data` is no longer needed

# Returns

the `gdk::Atom` that corresponds to the
 newly registered format’s mime-type.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn register_deserialize_tagset -->
This function registers GTK+’s internal rich text serialization
format with the passed `self`. See
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_tagset` for details.
## `tagset_name`
an optional tagset name, on `None`

# Returns

the `gdk::Atom` that corresponds to the
 newly registered format’s mime-type.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn register_serialize_format -->
This function registers a rich text serialization `function` along with
its `mime_type` with the passed `self`.
## `mime_type`
the format’s mime-type
## `function`
the serialize function to register
## `user_data`
`function`’s user_data
## `user_data_destroy`
a function to call when `user_data` is no longer needed

# Returns

the `gdk::Atom` that corresponds to the
 newly registered format’s mime-type.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn register_serialize_tagset -->
This function registers GTK+’s internal rich text serialization
format with the passed `self`. The internal format does not comply
to any standard rich text format and only works between `TextBuffer`
instances. It is capable of serializing all of a text buffer’s tags
and embedded pixbufs.

This function is just a wrapper around
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_format`. The mime type used
for registering is “application/x-gtk-text-buffer-rich-text”, or
“application/x-gtk-text-buffer-rich-text;format=`tagset_name`” if a
`tagset_name` was passed.

The `tagset_name` can be used to restrict the transfer of rich text
to buffers with compatible sets of tags, in order to avoid unknown
tags from being pasted. It is probably the common case to pass an
identifier != `None` here, since the `None` tagset requires the
receiving buffer to deal with with pasting of arbitrary tags.
## `tagset_name`
an optional tagset name, on `None`

# Returns

the `gdk::Atom` that corresponds to the
 newly registered format’s mime-type.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn remove_all_tags -->
Removes all tags in the range between `start` and `end`. Be careful
with this function; it could remove tags added in code unrelated to
the code you’re currently writing. That is, using this function is
probably a bad idea if you have two or more unrelated code sections
that add tags.
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn remove_selection_clipboard -->
Removes a `Clipboard` added with
`TextBuffer::add_selection_clipboard`.
## `clipboard`
a `Clipboard` added to `self` by
 `TextBuffer::add_selection_clipboard`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn remove_tag -->
Emits the “remove-tag” signal. The default handler for the signal
removes all occurrences of `tag` from the given range. `start` and
`end` don’t have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn remove_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTable::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBuffer::remove_tag`.
## `name`
name of a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn select_range -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them in two steps
with `TextBuffer::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `ins`
where to put the “insert” mark
## `bound`
where to put the “selection_bound” mark
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn serialize -->
This function serializes the portion of text between `start`
and `end` in the rich text format represented by `format`.

`formats` to be used must be registered using
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_tagset` beforehand.
## `content_buffer`
the `TextBuffer` to serialize
## `format`
the rich text format to use for serializing
## `start`
start of block of text to serialize
## `end`
end of block of test to serialize
## `length`
return location for the length of the serialized data

# Returns

the serialized
 data, encoded as `format`
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn set_modified -->
Used to keep track of whether the buffer has been modified since the
last time it was saved. Whenever the buffer is saved to disk, call
gtk_text_buffer_set_modified (`self`, FALSE). When the buffer is modified,
it will automatically toggled on the modified bit again. When the modified
bit flips, the buffer emits the `TextBuffer::modified-changed` signal.
## `setting`
modification flag setting
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn set_text -->
Deletes current contents of `self`, and inserts `text` instead. If
`len` is -1, `text` must be nul-terminated. `text` must be valid UTF-8.
## `text`
UTF-8 text to insert
## `len`
length of `text` in bytes
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn unregister_deserialize_format -->
This function unregisters a rich text format that was previously
registered using `TextBuffer::register_deserialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_deserialize_tagset`.
## `format`
a `gdk::Atom` representing a registered rich text format.
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn unregister_serialize_format -->
This function unregisters a rich text format that was previously
registered using `TextBuffer::register_serialize_format` or
`TextBuffer::register_serialize_tagset`
## `format`
a `gdk::Atom` representing a registered rich text format.
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo -->
These values are used as “info” for the targets contained in the
lists returned by `TextBuffer::get_copy_target_list` and
`TextBuffer::get_paste_target_list`.

The values counts down from `-1` to avoid clashes
with application added drag destinations which usually start at 0.
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant BufferContents -->
Buffer contents
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant RichText -->
Rich text
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant Text -->
Text
<!-- struct TextChildAnchor -->
A `TextChildAnchor` is a spot in the buffer where child widgets can
be “anchored” (inserted inline, as if they were characters). The anchor
can have multiple widgets anchored, to allow for multiple views.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TextChildAnchor::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextChildAnchor`. Usually you would then insert
it into a `TextBuffer` with `TextBuffer::insert_child_anchor`.
To perform the creation and insertion in one step, use the
convenience function `TextBuffer::create_child_anchor`.

# Returns

a new `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- impl TextChildAnchor::fn get_deleted -->
Determines whether a child anchor has been deleted from
the buffer. Keep in mind that the child anchor will be
unreferenced when removed from the buffer, so you need to
hold your own reference (with `gobject::Object::ref`) if you plan
to use this function — otherwise all deleted child anchors
will also be finalized.

# Returns

`true` if the child anchor has been deleted from its buffer
<!-- impl TextChildAnchor::fn get_widgets -->
Gets a list of all widgets anchored at this child anchor.
The returned list should be freed with `glib::List::free`.

# Returns

list of widgets anchored at `self`
<!-- enum TextDirection -->
Reading directions for text.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant None -->
No direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Ltr -->
Left to right text direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Rtl -->
Right to left text direction.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection -->
Granularity types that extend the text selection. Use the
`TextView::extend-selection` signal to customize the selection.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Word -->
Selects the current word. It is triggered by
 a double-click for example.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Line -->
Selects the current line. It is triggered by
 a triple-click for example.

Feature: `v3_16`

<!-- struct TextIter -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn assign -->
Assigns the value of `other` to `self`. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be assigned
with `GtkTextIter i = j;`. The
function is used by language bindings.
## `other`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_char -->
Moves backward by one character offset. Returns `true` if movement
was possible; if `self` was the first in the buffer (character
offset 0), `TextIter::backward_char` returns `false` for convenience when
writing loops.

# Returns

whether movement was possible
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_position -->
Like `TextIter::forward_cursor_position`, but moves backward.

# Returns

`true` if we moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_find_char -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_find_char`, but goes backward from `self`.
## `pred`
function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_search -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_search`, but moves backward.

`match_end` will never be set to a `TextIter` located after `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_start` before or at `self`.
## `str`
search string
## `flags`
bitmask of flags affecting the search
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_start`, or `None` for start of buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_start -->
Moves backward to the previous sentence start; if `self` is already at
the start of a sentence, moves backward to the next one. Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_sentence_start` up to `count` times,
or until it returns `false`. If `count` is negative, moves forward
instead of backward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves backward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles before `self`. Sets `self`
to the location of the toggle, or the start of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle before `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the previous visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous visible line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous visible word start. (If `self` is currently
on a word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_visible_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous word start. (If `self` is currently on a
word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn begins_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled on at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled on at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::begins_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the beginning of the tagged range, and that the
character at `self` is inside the tagged range. In other
words, unlike `TextIter::ends_tag`, if `TextIter::begins_tag` returns
`true`, `TextIter::has_tag` will also return `true` for the same
parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the start of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn can_insert -->
Considering the default editability of the buffer, and tags that
affect editability, determines whether text inserted at `self` would
be editable. If text inserted at `self` would be editable then the
user should be allowed to insert text at `self`.
`TextBuffer::insert_interactive` uses this function to decide
whether insertions are allowed at a given position.
## `default_editability`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether text inserted at `self` would be editable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn compare -->
A `qsort`-style function that returns negative if `self` is less than
`rhs`, positive if `self` is greater than `rhs`, and 0 if they’re equal.
Ordering is in character offset order, i.e. the first character in the buffer
is less than the second character in the buffer.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

-1 if `self` is less than `rhs`, 1 if `self` is greater, 0 if they are equal
<!-- impl TextIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically-allocated copy of an iterator. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be copied with a
simple assignment (`GtkTextIter i = j;`). The
function is used by language bindings.

# Returns

a copy of the `self`, free with `TextIter::free`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn editable -->
Returns whether the character at `self` is within an editable region
of text. Non-editable text is “locked” and can’t be changed by the
user via `TextView`. This function is simply a convenience
wrapper around `TextIter::get_attributes`. If no tags applied
to this text affect editability, `default_setting` will be returned.

You don’t want to use this function to decide whether text can be
inserted at `self`, because for insertion you don’t want to know
whether the char at `self` is inside an editable range, you want to
know whether a new character inserted at `self` would be inside an
editable range. Use `TextIter::can_insert` to handle this
case.
## `default_setting`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether `self` is inside an editable range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to the start of the paragraph
delimiter characters for a line (delimiters will be either a
newline, a carriage return, a carriage return followed by a
newline, or a Unicode paragraph separator character). Note that an
iterator pointing to the \n of a \r\n pair will not be counted as
the end of a line, the line ends before the \r. The end iterator is
considered to be at the end of a line, even though there are no
paragraph delimiter chars there.

# Returns

whether `self` is at the end of a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` ends a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled off at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled off at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the end of the tagged range, but that the character
at `self` is outside the tagged range. In other words,
unlike `TextIter::begins_tag`, if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`,
`TextIter::has_tag` will return `false` for the same parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the end of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_word -->
Determines whether `self` ends a natural-language word. Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn equal -->
Tests whether two iterators are equal, using the fastest possible
mechanism. This function is very fast; you can expect it to perform
better than e.g. getting the character offset for each iterator and
comparing the offsets yourself. Also, it’s a bit faster than
`TextIter::compare`.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if the iterators point to the same place in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_char -->
Moves `self` forward by one character offset. Note that images
embedded in the buffer occupy 1 character slot, so
`TextIter::forward_char` may actually move onto an image instead
of a character, if you have images in your buffer. If `self` is the
end iterator or one character before it, `self` will now point at
the end iterator, and `TextIter::forward_char` returns `false` for
convenience when writing loops.

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters if possible (if `count` would move past the
start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of the
buffer). The return value indicates whether the new position of
`self` is different from its original position, and dereferenceable
(the last iterator in the buffer is not dereferenceable). If `count`
is 0, the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move, may be negative

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward by a single cursor position. Cursor positions
are (unsurprisingly) positions where the cursor can appear. Perhaps
surprisingly, there may not be a cursor position between all
characters. The most common example for European languages would be
a carriage return/newline sequence. For some Unicode characters,
the equivalent of say the letter “a” with an accent mark will be
represented as two characters, first the letter then a "combining
mark" that causes the accent to be rendered; so the cursor can’t go
between those two characters. See also the `pango::LogAttr`-struct and
`pango_break` function.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_find_char -->
Advances `self`, calling `pred` on each character. If
`pred` returns `true`, returns `true` and stops scanning.
If `pred` never returns `true`, `self` is set to `limit` if
`limit` is non-`None`, otherwise to the end iterator.
## `pred`
a function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next line. If the iter is already on the
last line of the buffer, moves the iter to the end of the current line.
If after the operation, the iter is at the end of the buffer and not
dereferencable, returns `false`. Otherwise, returns `true`.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_search -->
Searches forward for `str`. Any match is returned by setting
`match_start` to the first character of the match and `match_end` to the
first character after the match. The search will not continue past
`limit`. Note that a search is a linear or O(n) operation, so you
may wish to use `limit` to avoid locking up your UI on large
buffers.

`match_start` will never be set to a `TextIter` located before `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_end` after or at `self`.
## `str`
a search string
## `flags`
flags affecting how the search is done
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_end`, or `None` for the end of the buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_end -->
Moves forward to the next sentence end. (If `self` is at the end of
a sentence, moves to the next end of sentence.) Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_sentence_end` `count` times (or until
`TextIter::forward_sentence_end` returns `false`). If `count` is
negative, moves backward instead of forward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_end -->
Moves `self` forward to the “end iterator,” which points one past the last
valid character in the buffer. `TextIter::get_char` called on the
end iterator returns 0, which is convenient for writing loops.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_line_end -->
Moves the iterator to point to the paragraph delimiter characters,
which will be either a newline, a carriage return, a carriage
return/newline in sequence, or the Unicode paragraph separator
character. If the iterator is already at the paragraph delimiter
characters, moves to the paragraph delimiter characters for the
next line. If `self` is on the last line in the buffer, which does
not end in paragraph delimiters, moves to the end iterator (end of
the last line), and returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new location is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves forward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles after `self`. Sets `self` to
the location of the toggle, or to the end of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle after `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the next visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next visible line. Returns `true` if there
was a next line to move to, and `false` if `self` was simply moved to
the end of the buffer and is now not dereferenceable, or if `self` was
already at the end of the buffer.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next visible word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_visible_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn free -->
Free an iterator allocated on the heap. This function
is intended for use in language bindings, and is not
especially useful for applications, because iterators can
simply be allocated on the stack.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_attributes -->
Computes the effect of any tags applied to this spot in the
text. The `values` parameter should be initialized to the default
settings you wish to use if no tags are in effect. You’d typically
obtain the defaults from `TextView::get_default_attributes`.

`TextIter::get_attributes` will modify `values`, applying the
effects of any tags present at `self`. If any tags affected `values`,
the function returns `true`.
## `values`
a `TextAttributes` to be filled in

# Returns

`true` if `values` was modified
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` this iterator is associated with.

# Returns

the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_bytes_in_line -->
Returns the number of bytes in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of bytes in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_char -->
The Unicode character at this iterator is returned. (Equivalent to
operator* on a C++ iterator.) If the element at this iterator is a
non-character element, such as an image embedded in the buffer, the
Unicode “unknown” character 0xFFFC is returned. If invoked on
the end iterator, zero is returned; zero is not a valid Unicode character.
So you can write a loop which ends when `TextIter::get_char`
returns 0.

# Returns

a Unicode character, or 0 if `self` is not dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_chars_in_line -->
Returns the number of characters in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of characters in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_child_anchor -->
If the location at `self` contains a child anchor, the
anchor is returned (with no new reference count added). Otherwise,
`None` is returned.

# Returns

the anchor at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_language -->
A convenience wrapper around `TextIter::get_attributes`,
which returns the language in effect at `self`. If no tags affecting
language apply to `self`, the return value is identical to that of
`gtk_get_default_language`.

# Returns

language in effect at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line -->
Returns the line number containing the iterator. Lines in
a `TextBuffer` are numbered beginning with 0 for the first
line in the buffer.

# Returns

a line number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_index -->
Returns the byte index of the iterator, counting
from the start of a newline-terminated line.
Remember that `TextBuffer` encodes text in
UTF-8, and that characters can require a variable
number of bytes to represent.

# Returns

distance from start of line, in bytes
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_offset -->
Returns the character offset of the iterator,
counting from the start of a newline-terminated line.
The first character on the line has offset 0.

# Returns

offset from start of line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_marks -->
Returns a list of all `TextMark` at this location. Because marks
are not iterable (they don’t take up any "space" in the buffer,
they are just marks in between iterable locations), multiple marks
can exist in the same place. The returned list is not in any
meaningful order.

# Returns

list of `TextMark`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_offset -->
Returns the character offset of an iterator.
Each character in a `TextBuffer` has an offset,
starting with 0 for the first character in the buffer.
Use `TextBuffer::get_iter_at_offset` to convert an
offset back into an iterator.

# Returns

a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_pixbuf -->
If the element at `self` is a pixbuf, the pixbuf is returned
(with no new reference count added). Otherwise,
`None` is returned.

# Returns

the pixbuf at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the given range. A “slice” is an array of
characters encoded in UTF-8 format, including the Unicode “unknown”
character 0xFFFC for iterable non-character elements in the buffer,
such as images. Because images are encoded in the slice, byte and
character offsets in the returned array will correspond to byte
offsets in the text buffer. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf or
widget is in the buffer.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_tags -->
Returns a list of tags that apply to `self`, in ascending order of
priority (highest-priority tags are last). The `TextTag` in the
list don’t have a reference added, but you have to free the list
itself.

# Returns

list of `TextTag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_text -->
Returns text in the given range. If the range
contains non-text elements such as images, the character and byte
offsets in the returned string will not correspond to character and
byte offsets in the buffer. If you want offsets to correspond, see
`TextIter::get_slice`.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

array of characters from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_toggled_tags -->
Returns a list of `TextTag` that are toggled on or off at this
point. (If `toggled_on` is `true`, the list contains tags that are
toggled on.) If a tag is toggled on at `self`, then some non-empty
range of characters following `self` has that tag applied to it. If
a tag is toggled off, then some non-empty range following `self`
does not have the tag applied to it.
## `toggled_on`
`true` to get toggled-on tags

# Returns

tags toggled at this point
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_index -->
Returns the number of bytes from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting bytes that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

byte index of `self` with respect to the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_offset -->
Returns the offset in characters from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting characters that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

offset in visible characters from the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_slice -->
Like `TextIter::get_slice`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_text -->
Like `TextIter::get_text`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

string containing visible text in the
range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn has_tag -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to a character that is part of a range tagged
with `tag`. See also `TextIter::begins_tag` and `TextIter::ends_tag`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`

# Returns

whether `self` is tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn in_range -->
Checks whether `self` falls in the range [`start`, `end`).
`start` and `end` must be in ascending order.
## `start`
start of range
## `end`
end of range

# Returns

`true` if `self` is in the range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` is inside a sentence (as opposed to in
between two sentences, e.g. after a period and before the first
letter of the next sentence). Sentence boundaries are determined
by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language (if not, the
correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_word -->
Determines whether the character pointed by `self` is part of a
natural-language word (as opposed to say inside some whitespace). Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break algorithms).

Note that if `TextIter::starts_word` returns `true`, then this function
returns `true` too, since `self` points to the first character of the word.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_cursor_position -->
See `TextIter::forward_cursor_position` or `pango::LogAttr` or
`pango_break` for details on what a cursor position is.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor can be placed at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_end -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the end iterator, i.e. one past the last
dereferenceable iterator in the buffer. `TextIter::is_end` is
the most efficient way to check whether an iterator is the end
iterator.

# Returns

whether `self` is the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_start -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the first iterator in the buffer, that is
if `self` has a character offset of 0.

# Returns

whether `self` is the first in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn order -->
Swaps the value of `self` and `second` if `second` comes before
`self` in the buffer. That is, ensures that `self` and `second` are
in sequence. Most text buffer functions that take a range call this
automatically on your behalf, so there’s no real reason to call it yourself
in those cases. There are some exceptions, such as `TextIter::in_range`,
that expect a pre-sorted range.
## `second`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line -->
Moves iterator `self` to the start of the line `line_number`. If
`line_number` is negative or larger than the number of lines in the
buffer, moves `self` to the start of the last line in the buffer.
## `line_number`
line number (counted from 0)
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_index -->
Same as `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but works with a
byte index. The given byte index must be at
the start of a character, it can’t be in the middle of a UTF-8
encoded character.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_offset -->
Moves `self` within a line, to a new character
(not byte) offset. The given character offset must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the line; if equal, `self`
moves to the start of the next line. See
`TextIter::set_line_index` if you have a byte index rather than
a character offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_offset -->
Sets `self` to point to `char_offset`. `char_offset` counts from the start
of the entire text buffer, starting with 0.
## `char_offset`
a character number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_index -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_index`, but the index is in visible
bytes, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not counted
in the index.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_offset -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but the offset is in visible
characters, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not
counted in the offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` begins a paragraph,
i.e. if `TextIter::get_line_offset` would return 0.
However this function is potentially more efficient than
`TextIter::get_line_offset` because it doesn’t have to compute
the offset, it just has to see whether it’s 0.

# Returns

whether `self` begins a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` begins a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_word -->
Determines whether `self` begins a natural-language word. Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn toggles_tag -->
This is equivalent to (`TextIter::begins_tag` ||
`TextIter::ends_tag`), i.e. it tells you whether a range with
`tag` applied to it begins or ends at `self`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `tag` is toggled on or off at `self`
<!-- struct TextMark -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.

A `TextMark` is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in
the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
`TextBuffer::get_iter_at_mark`. Unlike iterators, marks remain valid across
buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or
deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the
position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a
mark, a mark with “left gravity” will be moved to the
beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with “right
gravity” will be moved to the end.

Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
displayed.

Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the validity
of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at any time with
`TextBuffer::delete_mark`. Once deleted from the buffer, a mark is
essentially useless.

Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the
`TextMark` object around.

Marks are typically created using the `TextBuffer::create_mark` function.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TextMark::fn new -->
Creates a text mark. Add it to a buffer using `TextBuffer::add_mark`.
If `name` is `None`, the mark is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be
retrieved by name using `TextBuffer::get_mark`. If a mark has left
gravity, and text is inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark
will be moved to the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has
right gravity (`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the
right of newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a
mark with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).
## `name`
mark name or `None`
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark should have left gravity

# Returns

new `TextMark`
<!-- impl TextMark::fn get_buffer -->
Gets the buffer this mark is located inside,
or `None` if the mark is deleted.

# Returns

the mark’s `TextBuffer`
<!-- impl TextMark::fn get_deleted -->
Returns `true` if the mark has been removed from its buffer
with `TextBuffer::delete_mark`. See `TextBuffer::add_mark`
for a way to add it to a buffer again.

# Returns

whether the mark is deleted
<!-- impl TextMark::fn get_left_gravity -->
Determines whether the mark has left gravity.

# Returns

`true` if the mark has left gravity, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl TextMark::fn get_name -->
Returns the mark name; returns NULL for anonymous marks.

# Returns

mark name
<!-- impl TextMark::fn get_visible -->
Returns `true` if the mark is visible (i.e. a cursor is displayed
for it).

# Returns

`true` if visible
<!-- impl TextMark::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility of `self`; the insertion point is normally
visible, i.e. you can see it as a vertical bar. Also, the text
widget uses a visible mark to indicate where a drop will occur when
dragging-and-dropping text. Most other marks are not visible.
Marks are not visible by default.
## `setting`
visibility of mark
<!-- struct TextTag -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and
data types related to the text widget and how they work together.

Tags should be in the `TextTagTable` for a given `TextBuffer`
before using them with that buffer.

`TextBuffer::create_tag` is the best way to create tags.
See “gtk3-demo” for numerous examples.

For each property of `TextTag`, there is a “set” property, e.g.
“font-set” corresponds to “font”. These “set” properties reflect
whether a property has been set or not.
They are maintained by GTK+ and you should not set them independently.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TextTag::fn new -->
Creates a `TextTag`. Configure the tag using object arguments,
i.e. using `gobject::Object::set`.
## `name`
tag name, or `None`

# Returns

a new `TextTag`
<!-- impl TextTag::fn event -->
Emits the “event” signal on the `TextTag`.
## `event_object`
object that received the event, such as a widget
## `event`
the event
## `iter`
location where the event was received

# Returns

result of signal emission (whether the event was handled)
<!-- impl TextTag::fn get_priority -->
Get the tag priority.

# Returns

The tag’s priority.
<!-- impl TextTag::fn set_priority -->
Sets the priority of a `TextTag`. Valid priorities
start at 0 and go to one less than `TextTagTable::get_size`.
Each tag in a table has a unique priority; setting the priority
of one tag shifts the priorities of all the other tags in the
table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. Higher priority
tags “win” if two tags both set the same text attribute. When adding
a tag to a tag table, it will be assigned the highest priority in
the table by default; so normally the precedence of a set of tags
is the order in which they were added to the table, or created with
`TextBuffer::create_tag`, which adds the tag to the buffer’s table
automatically.
## `priority`
the new priority
<!-- struct TextTagTable -->

[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and
data types related to the text widget and how they work together.

# `GtkTextTagTables` as `Buildable`

The `TextTagTable` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding tags by specifying “tag” as the “type” attribute
of a `<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying tags:

```text
<object class="GtkTextTagTable">
 <child type="tag">
   <object class="GtkTextTag"/>
 </child>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextTagTable`. The table contains no tags by
default.

# Returns

a new `TextTagTable`
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn add -->
Add a tag to the table. The tag is assigned the highest priority
in the table.

`tag` must not be in a tag table already, and may not have
the same name as an already-added tag.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`

# Returns

`true` on success.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn foreach -->
Calls `func` on each tag in `self`, with user data `data`.
Note that the table may not be modified while iterating
over it (you can’t add/remove tags).
## `func`
a function to call on each tag
## `data`
user data
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn get_size -->
Returns the size of the table (number of tags)

# Returns

number of tags in `self`
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn lookup -->
Look up a named tag.
## `name`
name of a tag

# Returns

The tag, or `None` if none by that name is in the table.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn remove -->
Remove a tag from the table. If a `TextBuffer` has `self` as its tag table,
the tag is removed from the buffer. The table’s reference to the tag is
removed, so the tag will end up destroyed if you don’t have a reference to
it.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
<!-- struct TextView -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.

# Implements

[`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ScrollableExt`](trait.ScrollableExt.html)
<!-- impl TextView::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextView`. If you don’t call `TextView::set_buffer`
before using the text view, an empty default buffer will be created
for you. Get the buffer with `TextView::get_buffer`. If you want
to specify your own buffer, consider `TextView::new_with_buffer`.

# Returns

a new `TextView`
<!-- impl TextView::fn new_with_buffer -->
Creates a new `TextView` widget displaying the buffer
`buffer`. One buffer can be shared among many widgets.
`buffer` may be `None` to create a default buffer, in which case
this function is equivalent to `TextView::new`. The
text view adds its own reference count to the buffer; it does not
take over an existing reference.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`

# Returns

a new `TextView`.
<!-- impl TextView::fn add_child_at_anchor -->
Adds a child widget in the text buffer, at the given `anchor`.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor` in the `TextBuffer` for `self`
<!-- impl TextView::fn add_child_in_window -->
Adds a child at fixed coordinates in one of the text widget's
windows.

The window must have nonzero size (see
`TextView::set_border_window_size`). Note that the child
coordinates are given relative to scrolling. When
placing a child in `TextWindowType::Widget`, scrolling is
irrelevant, the child floats above all scrollable areas. But when
placing a child in one of the scrollable windows (border windows or
text window) it will move with the scrolling as needed.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `which_window`
which window the child should appear in
## `xpos`
X position of child in window coordinates
## `ypos`
Y position of child in window coordinates
<!-- impl TextView::fn backward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` backward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- impl TextView::fn backward_display_line_start -->
Moves the given `iter` backward to the next display line start.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- impl TextView::fn buffer_to_window_coords -->
Converts coordinate (`buffer_x`, `buffer_y`) to coordinates for the window
`win`, and stores the result in (`window_x`, `window_y`).

Note that you can’t convert coordinates for a nonexisting window (see
`TextView::set_border_window_size`).
## `win`
a `TextWindowType` except `TextWindowType::Private`
## `buffer_x`
buffer x coordinate
## `buffer_y`
buffer y coordinate
## `window_x`
window x coordinate return location or `None`
## `window_y`
window y coordinate return location or `None`
<!-- impl TextView::fn forward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` forward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- impl TextView::fn forward_display_line_end -->
Moves the given `iter` forward to the next display line end.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_accepts_tab -->
Returns whether pressing the Tab key inserts a tab characters.
`TextView::set_accepts_tab`.

# Returns

`true` if pressing the Tab key inserts a tab character,
 `false` if pressing the Tab key moves the keyboard focus.
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_border_window_size -->
Gets the width of the specified border window. See
`TextView::set_border_window_size`.
## `type_`
window to return size from

# Returns

width of window
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` being displayed by this text view.
The reference count on the buffer is not incremented; the caller
of this function won’t own a new reference.

# Returns

a `TextBuffer`
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_cursor_locations -->
Given an `iter` within a text layout, determine the positions of the
strong and weak cursors if the insertion point is at that
iterator. The position of each cursor is stored as a zero-width
rectangle. The strong cursor location is the location where
characters of the directionality equal to the base direction of the
paragraph are inserted. The weak cursor location is the location
where characters of the directionality opposite to the base
direction of the paragraph are inserted.

If `iter` is `None`, the actual cursor position is used.

Note that if `iter` happens to be the actual cursor position, and
there is currently an IM preedit sequence being entered, the
returned locations will be adjusted to account for the preedit
cursor’s offset within the preedit sequence.

The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextView::buffer_to_window_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `strong`
location to store the strong
 cursor position (may be `None`)
## `weak`
location to store the weak
 cursor position (may be `None`)
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_cursor_visible -->
Find out whether the cursor is being displayed.

# Returns

whether the insertion mark is visible
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_default_attributes -->
Obtains a copy of the default text attributes. These are the
attributes used for text unless a tag overrides them.
You’d typically pass the default attributes in to
`TextIter::get_attributes` in order to get the
attributes in effect at a given text position.

The return value is a copy owned by the caller of this function,
and should be freed with `TextAttributes::unref`.

# Returns

a new `TextAttributes`
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_editable -->
Returns the default editability of the `TextView`. Tags in the
buffer may override this setting for some ranges of text.

# Returns

whether text is editable by default

Gets the value of the `TextView:input-purpose` property.

Feature: `v3_6`

<!-- impl TextView::fn get_iter_at_location -->
Retrieves the iterator at buffer coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer
coordinates are coordinates for the entire buffer, not just the
currently-displayed portion. If you have coordinates from an
event, you have to convert those to buffer coordinates with
`TextView::window_to_buffer_coords`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `x`
x position, in buffer coordinates
## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_iter_at_position -->
Retrieves the iterator pointing to the character at buffer
coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer coordinates are coordinates for
the entire buffer, not just the currently-displayed portion.
If you have coordinates from an event, you have to convert
those to buffer coordinates with
`TextView::window_to_buffer_coords`.

Note that this is different from `TextView::get_iter_at_location`,
which returns cursor locations, i.e. positions between
characters.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `trailing`
if non-`None`, location to store an integer indicating where
 in the grapheme the user clicked. It will either be
 zero, or the number of characters in the grapheme.
 0 represents the trailing edge of the grapheme.
## `x`
x position, in buffer coordinates
## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_iter_location -->
Gets a rectangle which roughly contains the character at `iter`.
The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextView::buffer_to_window_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `location`
bounds of the character at `iter`
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_justification -->
Gets the default justification of paragraphs in `self`.
Tags in the buffer may override the default.

Tags in the buffer may override the default.

# Returns

left margin in pixels
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_line_at_y -->
Gets the `TextIter` at the start of the line containing
the coordinate `y`. `y` is in buffer coordinates, convert from
window coordinates with `TextView::window_to_buffer_coords`.
If non-`None`, `line_top` will be filled with the coordinate of the top
edge of the line.
## `target_iter`
a `TextIter`
## `y`
a y coordinate
## `line_top`
return location for top coordinate of the line
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_line_yrange -->
Gets the y coordinate of the top of the line containing `iter`,
and the height of the line. The coordinate is a buffer coordinate;
convert to window coordinates with `TextView::buffer_to_window_coords`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `y`
return location for a y coordinate
## `height`
return location for a height
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_monospace -->

in the buffer may override the default.

# Returns

right margin in pixels
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_tabs -->
Gets the default tabs for `self`. Tags in the buffer may
override the defaults. The returned array will be `None` if
“standard” (8-space) tabs are used. Free the return value
with `pango::TabArray::free`.

# Returns

copy of default tab array, or `None` if “standard”
 tabs are used; must be freed with `pango::TabArray::free`.
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_vadjustment -->
Gets the vertical-scrolling `Adjustment`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `Scrollable::get_vadjustment`

# Returns

pointer to the vertical `Adjustment`
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_visible_rect -->
Fills `visible_rect` with the currently-visible
region of the buffer, in buffer coordinates. Convert to window coordinates
with `TextView::buffer_to_window_coords`.
## `visible_rect`
rectangle to fill
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_window -->
Retrieves the `gdk::Window` corresponding to an area of the text view;
possible windows include the overall widget window, child windows
on the left, right, top, bottom, and the window that displays the
text buffer. Windows are `None` and nonexistent if their width or
height is 0, and are nonexistent before the widget has been
realized.
## `win`
window to get

# Returns

a `gdk::Window`, or `None`
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_window_type -->
Usually used to find out which window an event corresponds to.
If you connect to an event signal on `self`, this function
should be called on `event-&gt;window` to
see which window it was.
## `window`
a window type

# Returns

the window type.
<!-- impl TextView::fn get_wrap_mode -->
Gets the line wrapping for the view.

# Returns

the line wrap setting
<!-- impl TextView::fn im_context_filter_keypress -->
Allow the `TextView` input method to internally handle key press
and release events. If this function returns `true`, then no further
processing should be done for this key event. See
`IMContext::filter_keypress`.

Note that you are expected to call this function from your handler
when overriding key event handling. This is needed in the case when
you need to insert your own key handling between the input method
and the default key event handling of the `TextView`.


```C
static gboolean
gtk_foo_bar_key_press_event (GtkWidget   *widget,
                             GdkEventKey *event)
{
  if ((key->keyval == GDK_KEY_Return || key->keyval == GDK_KEY_KP_Enter))
    {
      if (gtk_text_view_im_context_filter_keypress (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (view), event))
        return TRUE;
    }

    // Do some stuff

  return GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (gtk_foo_bar_parent_class)->key_press_event (widget, event);
}
```
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- impl TextView::fn move_child -->
Updates the position of a child, as for `TextView::add_child_in_window`.
## `child`
child widget already added to the text view
## `xpos`
new X position in window coordinates
## `ypos`
new Y position in window coordinates
<!-- impl TextView::fn move_mark_onscreen -->
Moves a mark within the buffer so that it's
located within the currently-visible text area.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`

# Returns

`true` if the mark moved (wasn’t already onscreen)
<!-- impl TextView::fn move_visually -->
Move the iterator a given number of characters visually, treating
it as the strong cursor position. If `count` is positive, then the
new strong cursor position will be `count` positions to the right of
the old cursor position. If `count` is negative then the new strong
cursor position will be `count` positions to the left of the old
cursor position.

In the presence of bi-directional text, the correspondence
between logical and visual order will depend on the direction
of the current run, and there may be jumps when the cursor
is moved off of the end of a run.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `count`
number of characters to move (negative moves left,
 positive moves right)

# Returns

`true` if `iter` moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- impl TextView::fn place_cursor_onscreen -->
Moves the cursor to the currently visible region of the
buffer, it it isn’t there already.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor had to be moved.
<!-- impl TextView::fn reset_im_context -->
Reset the input method context of the text view if needed.

This can be necessary in the case where modifying the buffer
would confuse on-going input method behavior.
<!-- impl TextView::fn scroll_mark_onscreen -->
Scrolls `self` the minimum distance such that `mark` is contained
within the visible area of the widget.
## `mark`
a mark in the buffer for `self`
<!-- impl TextView::fn scroll_to_iter -->
Scrolls `self` so that `iter` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.

Note that this function uses the currently-computed height of the
lines in the text buffer. Line heights are computed in an idle
handler; so this function may not have the desired effect if it’s
called before the height computations. To avoid oddness, consider
using `TextView::scroll_to_mark` which saves a point to be
scrolled to after line validation.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments (if `false`,
 just get the mark onscreen)
## `xalign`
horizontal alignment of mark within visible area
## `yalign`
vertical alignment of mark within visible area

# Returns

`true` if scrolling occurred
<!-- impl TextView::fn scroll_to_mark -->
Scrolls `self` so that `mark` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments (if `false`, just
 get the mark onscreen)
## `xalign`
horizontal alignment of mark within visible area
## `yalign`
vertical alignment of mark within visible area
<!-- impl TextView::fn set_accepts_tab -->
Sets the behavior of the text widget when the Tab key is pressed.
If `accepts_tab` is `true`, a tab character is inserted. If `accepts_tab`
is `false` the keyboard focus is moved to the next widget in the focus
chain.
## `accepts_tab`
`true` if pressing the Tab key should insert a tab
 character, `false`, if pressing the Tab key should move the
 keyboard focus.
<!-- impl TextView::fn set_border_window_size -->
Sets the width of `TextWindowType::Left` or `TextWindowType::Right`,
or the height of `TextWindowType::Top` or `TextWindowType::Bottom`.
Automatically destroys the corresponding window if the size is set
to 0, and creates the window if the size is set to non-zero. This
function can only be used for the “border windows,” it doesn’t work
with `TextWindowType::Widget`, `TextWindowType::Text`, or
`TextWindowType::Private`.
## `type_`
window to affect
## `size`

<!-- impl TextView::fn set_buffer -->
Sets `buffer` as the buffer being displayed by `self`. The previous
buffer displayed by the text view is unreferenced, and a reference is
added to `buffer`. If you owned a reference to `buffer` before passing it
to this function, you must remove that reference yourself; `TextView`
will not “adopt” it.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`
<!-- impl TextView::fn set_cursor_visible -->

text probably shouldn’t have a visible cursor, so you may want to turn
the cursor off.
## `setting`
whether to show the insertion cursor
<!-- impl TextView::fn set_editable -->
Sets the default editability of the `TextView`. You can override
this default setting with tags in the buffer, using the “editable”

<!-- impl TextView::fn set_pixels_inside_wrap -->
Sets the default number of pixels of blank space to leave between
display/wrapped lines within a paragraph. May be overridden by
tags in `self`’s buffer.

See `TextView::forward_display_line` for an explanation of
display lines vs. paragraphs.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` begins a wrapped line
<!-- impl TextView::fn window_to_buffer_coords -->
Converts coordinates on the window identified by `win` to buffer
coordinates, storing the result in (`buffer_x`,`buffer_y`).

Note that you can’t convert coordinates for a nonexisting window (see
`TextView::set_border_window_size`).

<!-- struct ToggleButton -->
A `ToggleButton` is a `Button` which will remain “pressed-in” when
clicked. Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its
normal state.

A toggle button is created by calling either `ToggleButton::new` or
`ToggleButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, it is advisable to
pack a widget, (such as a `Label` and/or a `Image`), into the toggle
button’s container. (See `Button` for more information).

The state of a `ToggleButton` can be set specifically using
`ToggleButtonExt::set_active`, and retrieved using
`ToggleButtonExt::get_active`.

To simply switch the state of a toggle button, use `ToggleButtonExt::toggled`.

## Creating two `ToggleButton` widgets.


```C
void make_toggles (void) {
   GtkWidget *dialog, *toggle1, *toggle2;
   GtkWidget *content_area;
   const char *text;

   dialog = gtk_dialog_new (text);
   content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area ();

   text = "Hi, i’m a toggle button.";
   toggle1 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);

   // Makes this toggle button invisible
   gtk_toggle_button_set_mode (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (toggle1),
                               TRUE);

   g_signal_connect (toggle1, "toggled",
                     G_CALLBACK (output_state),
                     NULL);
   gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (content_area),
                       toggle1, FALSE, FALSE, 2);

   text = "Hi, i’m a toggle button.";
   toggle2 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);
   gtk_toggle_button_set_mode (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (toggle2),
                               FALSE);
   g_signal_connect (toggle2, "toggled",

# Implementors

[`CheckButton`](struct.CheckButton.html), [`MenuButton`](struct.MenuButton.html), [`ToggleButton`](struct.ToggleButton.html)
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new -->
Creates a new toggle button. A widget should be packed into the button, as in `Button::new`.

# Returns

a new toggle button.
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new toggle button with a text label.
## `label`
a string containing the message to be placed in the toggle button.

# Returns

a new toggle button.
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `ToggleButton` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the button.
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `ToggleButton`
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn get_active -->
Queries a `ToggleButton` and returns its current state. Returns `true` if
the toggle button is pressed in and `false` if it is raised.

# Returns

a `gboolean` value.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn get_inconsistent -->
Gets the value set by `ToggleButtonExt::set_inconsistent`.

# Returns

`true` if the button is displayed as inconsistent, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn get_mode -->
Retrieves whether the button is displayed as a separate indicator
and label. See `ToggleButtonExt::set_mode`.

# Returns

`true` if the togglebutton is drawn as a separate indicator
 and label.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_active -->
Sets the status of the toggle button. Set to `true` if you want the
`ToggleButton` to be “pressed in”, and `false` to raise it.
This action causes the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal and the
`Button::clicked` signal to be emitted.
## `is_active`
`true` or `false`.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_inconsistent -->
If the user has selected a range of elements (such as some text or
spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a toggle button, and the
current values in that range are inconsistent, you may want to
display the toggle in an “in between” state. This function turns on
“in between” display. Normally you would turn off the inconsistent
state again if the user toggles the toggle button. This has to be
done manually, `ToggleButtonExt::set_inconsistent` only affects
visual appearance, it doesn’t affect the semantics of the button.
## `setting`
`true` if state is inconsistent
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_mode -->
Sets whether the button is displayed as a separate indicator and label.
You can call this function on a checkbutton or a radiobutton with
`draw_indicator` = `false` to make the button look like a normal button

This function only affects instances of classes like `CheckButton`
and `RadioButton` that derive from `ToggleButton`,
not instances of `ToggleButton` itself.
## `draw_indicator`
if `true`, draw the button as a separate indicator
and label; if `false`, draw the button like a normal button
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn toggled -->
Emits the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal on the
`ToggleButton`. There is no good reason for an
application ever to call this function.
<!-- struct ToggleToolButton -->
A `ToggleToolButton` is a `ToolItem` that contains a toggle
button.

Use `ToggleToolButton::new` to create a new
`ToggleToolButton`.

<!-- struct ToolButton -->
``GtkToolButtons`` are ``GtkToolItems`` containing buttons.

Use `ToolButton::new` to create a new `ToolButton`.

The label of a `ToolButton` is determined by the properties
`ToolButton:label-widget`, `ToolButton:label`, and
`ToolButton:stock-id`. If `ToolButton:label-widget` is
non-`None`, then that widget is used as the label. Otherwise, if
`ToolButton:label` is non-`None`, that string is used as the label.
Otherwise, if `ToolButton:stock-id` is non-`None`, the label is
determined by the stock item. Otherwise, the button does not have a label.

The icon of a `ToolButton` is determined by the properties
`ToolButton:icon-widget` and `ToolButton:stock-id`. If
`ToolButton:icon-widget` is non-`None`, then
that widget is used as the icon. Otherwise, if `ToolButton:stock-id` is
non-`None`, the icon is determined by the stock item. Otherwise,
the button does not have a icon.

overridden by non-`None` “label”, “icon_widget” and “stock_id”
properties.
## `icon_name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- trait ToolButtonExt::fn set_icon_widget -->
Sets `icon` as the widget used as icon on `self`. If `icon_widget` is

<!-- struct ToolPalette -->
A `ToolPalette` allows you to add ``GtkToolItems`` to a palette-like
container with different categories and drag and drop support.

A `ToolPalette` is created with a call to `ToolPalette::new`.

``GtkToolItems`` cannot be added directly to a `ToolPalette` -
instead they are added to a `ToolItemGroup` which can than be added
to a `ToolPalette`. To add a `ToolItemGroup` to a `ToolPalette`,
use `ContainerExt::add`.


```C
GtkWidget *palette, *group;
GtkToolItem *item;

palette = gtk_tool_palette_new ();
group = gtk_tool_item_group_new (_("Test Category"));
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (palette), group);

item = gtk_tool_button_new_new (NULL, _("_Open"));
gtk_tool_button_set_icon_name (GTK_TOOL_BUTTON (item), "document-open");
gtk_tool_item_group_insert (GTK_TOOL_ITEM_GROUP (group), item, -1);
```

The easiest way to use drag and drop with `ToolPalette` is to call
`ToolPalette::add_drag_dest` with the desired drag source `palette`
and the desired drag target `widget`. Then `ToolPalette::get_drag_item`
can be used to get the dragged item in the `Widget::drag-data-received`
signal handler of the drag target.


```C
static void
passive_canvas_drag_data_received (GtkWidget        *widget,
                                   GdkDragContext   *context,

<!-- struct Toolbar -->
A toolbar is created with a call to `Toolbar::new`.

A toolbar can contain instances of a subclass of `ToolItem`. To add
a `ToolItem` to the a toolbar, use `Toolbar::insert`. To remove
an item from the toolbar use `ContainerExt::remove`. To add a button
to the toolbar, add an instance of `ToolButton`.

Toolbar items can be visually grouped by adding instances of
`SeparatorToolItem` to the toolbar. If the `Toolbar` child property
“expand” is `true` and the property `SeparatorToolItem:draw` is set to
`false`, the effect is to force all following items to the end of the toolbar.

Creating a context menu for the toolbar can be done by connecting to
the `Toolbar::popup-context-menu` signal.

Buttons display icons and text alongside each
 other, rather than vertically stacked
<!-- struct Tooltip -->
Basic tooltips can be realized simply by using `Widget::set_tooltip_text`
or `Widget::set_tooltip_markup` without any explicit tooltip object.

When you need a tooltip with a little more fancy contents, like adding an
image, or you want the tooltip to have different contents per `TreeView`
row or cell, you will have to do a little more work:

- Set the `Widget:has-tooltip` property to `true`, this will make GTK+
 monitor the widget for motion and related events which are needed to
 determine when and where to show a tooltip.

- Connect to the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal. This signal will be
 emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown. One of the arguments passed
 to the signal handler is a `Tooltip` object. This is the object that we
 are about to display as a tooltip, and can be manipulated in your callback
 using functions like `Tooltip::set_icon`. There are functions for setting
 the tooltip’s markup, setting an image from a named icon, or even putting in
 a custom widget.

 Return `true` from your query-tooltip handler. This causes the tooltip to be
 show. If you return `false`, it will not be shown.

In the probably rare case where you want to have even more control over the
tooltip that is about to be shown, you can set your own `Window` which
will be used as tooltip window. This works as follows:

- Set `Widget:has-tooltip` and connect to `Widget::query-tooltip` as before.
 Use `Widget::set_tooltip_window` to set a `Window` created by you as
 tooltip window.

- In the `Widget::query-tooltip` callback you can access your window using
 `Widget::get_tooltip_window` and manipulate as you wish. The semantics of
 the return value are exactly as before, return `true` to show the window,
 `false` to not show it.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn trigger_tooltip_query -->
Triggers a new tooltip query on `display`, in order to update the current
visible tooltip, or to show/hide the current tooltip. This function is
useful to call when, for example, the state of the widget changed by a
key press.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_custom -->
Replaces the widget packed into the tooltip with
`custom_widget`. `custom_widget` does not get destroyed when the tooltip goes
away.
By default a box with a `Image` and `Label` is embedded in
the tooltip, which can be configured using `Tooltip::set_markup`
and `Tooltip::set_icon`.
## `custom_widget`
a `Widget`, or `None` to unset the old custom widget.
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
`pixbuf`. If `pixbuf` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon_from_gicon -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text)
to be the icon indicated by `gicon` with the size indicated
by `size`. If `gicon` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `gicon`
a `gio::Icon` representing the icon, or `None`
## `size`
a stock icon size
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon_from_icon_name -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
the icon indicated by `icon_name` with the size indicated
by `size`. If `icon_name` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `icon_name`
an icon name, or `None`
## `size`
a stock icon size
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon_from_stock -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
the stock item indicated by `stock_id` with the size indicated
by `size`. If `stock_id` is `None`, the image will be hidden.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `Tooltip::set_icon_from_icon_name` instead.
## `stock_id`
a stock id, or `None`
## `size`
a stock icon size
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_markup -->
Sets the text of the tooltip to be `markup`, which is marked up
with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
If `markup` is `None`, the label will be hidden.
## `markup`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat]) or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_text -->
Sets the text of the tooltip to be `text`. If `text` is `None`, the label
will be hidden. See also `Tooltip::set_markup`.
## `text`
a text string or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_tip_area -->
Sets the area of the widget, where the contents of this tooltip apply,
to be `rect` (in widget coordinates). This is especially useful for
properly setting tooltips on `TreeView` rows and cells, ``GtkIconViews``,
etc.

For setting tooltips on `TreeView`, please refer to the convenience
functions for this: `TreeView::set_tooltip_row` and
`TreeView::set_tooltip_cell`.
## `rect`
a `gdk::Rectangle`
<!-- struct TreeIter -->
The `TreeIter` is the primary structure
for accessing a `TreeModel`. Models are expected to put a unique
integer in the `stamp` member, and put
model-specific data in the three `user_data`
members.
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically allocated tree iterator as a copy of `self`.

This function is not intended for use in applications,
because you can just copy the structs by value
(`GtkTreeIter new_iter = iter;`).
You must free this iter with `TreeIter::free`.

# Returns

a newly-allocated copy of `self`
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn free -->
Frees an iterator that has been allocated by `TreeIter::copy`.

This function is mainly used for language bindings.
<!-- struct TreeModel -->
The `TreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
use by the `TreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
type for it to be viewable by a `TreeView` widget.

The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
every node has different values depending on which column is being
queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
model decides how and if changes are made.

In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
— the `TreeStore` and the `ListStore`. To use these, the
developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
these two models are sufficient.

Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
particular node in a model. They are the `TreePath`-struct and
the `TreeIter`-struct (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
interface consists of operations on a `TreeIter`-struct.

A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
model. The `TreePath`-struct can be converted into either an
array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
the third node.

By contrast, a `TreeIter`-struct is a reference to a specific node on
a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
`TreeModel::get_iter`. These iterators are the primary way
of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
`TextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
a set of operations using them for navigating the model.

It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
For example, the `ListStore` model, which is internally a simple
linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
`TreeModelSort` stores an array and an offset in two of the
pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.

The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
to is valid (most notably the `TreeStore` and `ListStore`).
Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
As a result, the `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag was added to
indicate this behavior.

To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
callbacks.

## Acquiring a `TreeIter`-struct


```C
// Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
GtkTreePath *path;
GtkTreeIter iter;
GtkTreeIter parent_iter;

// get the iterator from a string
gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                     &iter,
                                     "3:2:5");

// get the iterator from a path
path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
gtk_tree_path_free (path);

// walk the tree to find the iterator
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               NULL, 3);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 2);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 5);
```

This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
`populate_model` function used below is not
shown, as it is specific to the `ListStore`. For information on
how to write such a function, see the `ListStore` documentation.

## Reading data from a `TreeModel`


```C
enum
{
  STRING_COLUMN,
  INT_COLUMN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

...

GtkTreeModel *list_store;
GtkTreeIter iter;
gboolean valid;
gint row_count = 0;

// make a new list_store
list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                 G_TYPE_STRING,
                                 G_TYPE_INT);

// Fill the list store with data
populate_model (list_store);

// Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
// through the list, reading each row.

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                       &iter);
while (valid)
 {
   gchar *str_data;
   gint   int_data;

   // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
   gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                       STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                       INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                       -1);

   // Do something with the data
   g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
            row_count, str_data, int_data);
   g_free (str_data);

   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                     &iter);
   row_count++;
 }
```

The `TreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
counting: `TreeModel::ref_node` and `TreeModel::unref_node`.
These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
displayed. `TreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
folders that are currently expanded in every current view.

When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
into account:

- Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
 This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
 as well.

- Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
 possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
 row-deleted signal is received.

- Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
 siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
 required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
 however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
 is always referenced when any view is attached).

A `TreePath` or `None`.

# Returns

A new `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn foreach -->
Calls func on each node in model in a depth-first fashion.

each column number followed by a place to store the value being
retrieved. The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to get a
value from column 0 with type `G_TYPE_STRING`, you would
write: `gtk_tree_model_get (model, iter, 0, &place_string_here, -1)`,
where `place_string_here` is a `gchararray`
to be filled with the string.

Returned values with type `G_TYPE_OBJECT` have to be unreferenced,

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_children -->
Sets `iter` to point to the first child of `parent`.

If `parent` has no children, `false` is returned and `iter` is
set to be invalid. `parent` will remain a valid node after this
function has been called.

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn ref_node -->
Lets the tree ref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons.

This function is primarily meant as a way for views to let
caching models know when nodes are being displayed (and hence,
whether or not to cache that node). Being displayed means a node
is in an expanded branch, regardless of whether the node is currently
visible in the viewport. For example, a file-system based model
would not want to keep the entire file-hierarchy in memory,
just the sections that are currently being displayed by
every current view.

A model should be expected to be able to get an iter independent
of its reffed state.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_changed -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-changed` signal on `self`.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_deleted -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-deleted` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models after a row has been removed.
The location pointed to by `path` should be the location that
the row previously was at. It may not be a valid location anymore.

Nodes that are deleted are not unreffed, this means that any
outstanding references on the deleted node should not be released.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the previous location of
 the deleted row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_has_child_toggled -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-has-child-toggled` signal on

state of a node changes.

This should be called by models when their rows have been
reordered.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node whose children
 have been reordered, or `None` if the depth of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the current position of
 each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`

 position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn sort_new_with_model -->
Creates a new `TreeModel`, with `self` as the child model.

# Returns

A new `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn unref_node -->
Lets the tree unref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons. For more information on what
this means, see `TreeModel::ref_node`.

Please note that nodes that are deleted are not unreffed.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- struct TreeModelFilter -->
A `TreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
and can do the following things:

- Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
 storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
 or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
 model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
 row should be filtered or not.

- Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
 This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
 values and also for creating a completely different model based
 on the given child model.

- Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
 in a `TreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
 time.

The basic API is similar to `TreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
see the section on `TreeModelSort`.

When using `TreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
`TreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
exposed by the child model. `TreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
because of reference counting rule 3, see the `TreeModel`
documentation. (Note that e.g. `TreeStore` does not implement
reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
the receiving node is not visible).

Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
nodes (see reference couting rule number 3 in the `TreeModel` section).

Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
`TreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.

This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
to accommodate this, `TreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `TreeModelFilter`'s
clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
was not cached), `TreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
of any parent node has changed.

Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
own. In this case, either rely on `TreeStore` to emit all signals
because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
yourself.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`TreeModelExt`](trait.TreeModelExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn clear_cache -->
This function should almost never be called. It clears the `self`
of any cached iterators that haven’t been reffed with
`TreeModel::ref_node`. This might be useful if the child model
being filtered is static (and doesn’t change often) and there has been
a lot of unreffed access to nodes. As a side effect of this function,
all unreffed iters will be invalid.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn convert_child_iter_to_iter -->
Sets `filter_iter` to point to the row in `self` that corresponds to the
row pointed at by `child_iter`. If `filter_iter` was not set, `false` is
returned.
## `filter_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `child_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on the child model.

# Returns

`true`, if `filter_iter` was set, i.e. if `child_iter` is a
valid iterator pointing to a visible row in child model.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn convert_child_path_to_path -->
Converts `child_path` to a path relative to `self`. That is, `child_path`
points to a path in the child model. The rerturned path will point to the
same row in the filtered model. If `child_path` isn’t a valid path on the
child model or points to a row which is not visible in `self`, then `None`
is returned.
## `child_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn convert_iter_to_child_iter -->
Sets `child_iter` to point to the row pointed to by `filter_iter`.
## `child_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `filter_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on `self`.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn convert_path_to_child_path -->
Converts `filter_path` to a path on the child model of `self`. That is,
`filter_path` points to a location in `self`. The returned path will
point to the same location in the model not being filtered. If `filter_path`
does not point to a location in the child model, `None` is returned.
## `filter_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn get_model -->
Returns a pointer to the child model of `self`.

# Returns

A pointer to a `TreeModel`.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn refilter -->
Emits ::row_changed for each row in the child model, which causes
the filter to re-evaluate whether a row is visible or not.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn set_modify_func -->
With the `n_columns` and `types` parameters, you give an array of column
types for this model (which will be exposed to the parent model/view).
The `func`, `data` and `destroy` parameters are for specifying the modify
function. The modify function will get called for each
data access, the goal of the modify function is to return the data which
should be displayed at the location specified using the parameters of the
modify function.

Note that `TreeModelFilter::set_modify_func`
can only be called once for a given filter model.
## `n_columns`
The number of columns in the filter model.
## `types`
The `GTypes` of the columns.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterModifyFunc``
## `data`
User data to pass to the modify function, or `None`.
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`.
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn set_visible_column -->
Sets `column` of the child_model to be the column where `self` should
look for visibility information. `columns` should be a column of type
`G_TYPE_BOOLEAN`, where `true` means that a row is visible, and `false`
if not.

Note that `TreeModelFilter::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilter::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `column`
A `gint` which is the column containing the visible information
<!-- impl TreeModelFilter::fn set_visible_func -->
Sets the visible function used when filtering the `self` to be `func`.
The function should return `true` if the given row should be visible and
`false` otherwise.

If the condition calculated by the function changes over time (e.g.
because it depends on some global parameters), you must call
`TreeModelFilter::refilter` to keep the visibility information
of the model up-to-date.

Note that `func` is called whenever a row is inserted, when it may still
be empty. The visible function should therefore take special care of empty
rows, like in the example below.


```C
static gboolean
visible_func (GtkTreeModel *model,
              GtkTreeIter  *iter,
              gpointer      data)
{
  // Visible if row is non-empty and first column is “HI”
  gchar *str;
  gboolean visible = FALSE;

  gtk_tree_model_get (model, iter, 0, &str, -1);
  if (str && strcmp (str, "HI") == 0)
    visible = TRUE;
  g_free (str);

  return visible;
}
```

Note that `TreeModelFilter::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilter::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``, the visible function
## `data`
User data to pass to the visible function, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`

The string representation of this path is “0”.

# Returns

A new `TreePath`-struct

Creates a new path with `first_index` and `varargs` as indices.
## `first_index`
first integer

A newly created `TreePath`-struct
<!-- impl TreePath::fn new_from_indicesv -->
Creates a new path with the given `indices` array of `length`.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `indices`
array of indices
## `length`
length of `indices` array

# Returns

A newly created `TreePath`-struct
<!-- impl TreePath::fn new_from_string -->
Creates a new `TreePath`-struct initialized to `path`.

`path` is expected to be a colon separated list of numbers.
For example, the string “10:4:0” would create a path of depth
3 pointing to the 11th child of the root node, the 5th
child of that 11th child, and the 1st child of that 5th child.
If an invalid path string is passed in, `None` is returned.
## `path`
The string representation of a path

# Returns

A newly-created `TreePath`-struct, or `None`
<!-- impl TreePath::fn append_index -->
Appends a new index to a path.

As a result, the depth of the path is increased.
## `index_`
the index
<!-- impl TreePath::fn compare -->
Compares two paths.

<!-- struct TreeSelection -->
The `TreeSelection` object is a helper object to manage the selection
for a `TreeView` widget. The `TreeSelection` object is
automatically created when a new `TreeView` widget is created, and
cannot exist independently of this widget. The primary reason the
`TreeSelection` objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
methods on the `TreeView` widget instead of a separate function.

The `TreeSelection` object is gotten from a `TreeView` by calling
`TreeView::get_selection`. It can be manipulated to check the
selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result, multiple
views of the same model can have completely different selections.
Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
first.

One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
a view is that the `TreeSelection::changed` signal is mostly a hint.
That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
Additionally, it may on occasion emit a `TreeSelection::changed` signal
when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
select_row on an already selected row).

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn count_selected_rows -->

Returns the current selection function.

# Returns

The function.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn get_selected -->
Sets `iter` to the currently selected node if `self` is set to
`SelectionMode::Single` or `SelectionMode::Browse`. `iter` may be NULL if you
just want to test if `self` has any selected nodes. `model` is filled
with the current model as a convenience. This function will not work if you
use `self` is `SelectionMode::Multiple`.
## `model`
A pointer to set to the `TreeModel`, or NULL.
## `iter`
The `TreeIter`, or NULL.

# Returns

TRUE, if there is a selected node.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn get_selected_rows -->
Creates a list of path of all selected rows. Additionally, if you are
planning on modifying the model after calling this function, you may
want to convert the returned list into a list of ``GtkTreeRowReferences``.
To do this, you can use `TreeRowReference::new`.

To free the return value, use:

```C
g_list_free_full (list, (GDestroyNotify) gtk_tree_path_free);
```

A pointer to set to the `TreeModel`, or `None`.

# Returns

A `glib::List` containing a `TreePath` for each selected row.

## `start_path`
The initial node of the range.
## `end_path`
The final node of the range.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected node. Note that you cannot modify
the tree or selection from within this function. As a result,
`TreeSelection::get_selected_rows` might be more useful.
## `func`
The function to call for each selected node.
## `data`
user data to pass to the function.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn set_mode -->
Sets the selection mode of the `self`. If the previous type was
`SelectionMode::Multiple`, then the anchor is kept selected, if it was

<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn set_select_function -->
Sets the selection function.

If set, this function is called before any node is selected or unselected,
giving some control over which nodes are selected. The select function

<!-- struct TreeSortable -->
`TreeSortable` is an interface to be implemented by tree models which
support sorting. The `TreeView` uses the methods provided by this interface
to sort the model.

# Implements

[`TreeSortableExt`](trait.TreeSortableExt.html), [`TreeModelExt`](trait.TreeModelExt.html)
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeSortable` methods.

# Implementors

[`ListStore`](struct.ListStore.html), [`TreeSortable`](struct.TreeSortable.html), [`TreeStore`](struct.TreeStore.html)
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn get_sort_column_id -->
Fills in `sort_column_id` and `order` with the current sort column and the
order. It returns `true` unless the `sort_column_id` is
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID` or
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_UNSORTED_SORT_COLUMN_ID`.
## `sort_column_id`
The sort column id to be filled in
## `order`
The `SortType` to be filled in

# Returns

`true` if the sort column is not one of the special sort
 column ids.
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn has_default_sort_func -->
Returns `true` if the model has a default sort function. This is used
primarily by `GtkTreeViewColumns` in order to determine if a model can
go back to the default state, or not.

# Returns

`true`, if the model has a default sort function
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn set_default_sort_func -->
Sets the default comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`.
If the current sort column id of `self` is
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, then the model will sort using
this function.

If `sort_func` is `None`, then there will be no default comparison function.
This means that once the model has been sorted, it can’t go back to the
default state. In this case, when the current sort column id of `self`
is `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, the model will be unsorted.
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the current sort column to be `sort_column_id`. The `self` will
resort itself to reflect this change, after emitting a
`TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal. `sort_column_id` may either be
a regular column id, or one of the following special values:

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: the default sort function
 will be used, if it is set

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_UNSORTED_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: no sorting will occur
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set
## `order`
The sort order of the column
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn set_sort_func -->
Sets the comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`. If the
current sort column id of `self` is the same as `sort_column_id`, then
the model will sort using this function.
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set the function for
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn sort_column_changed -->
Emits a `TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal on `self`.
<!-- struct TreeStore -->
The `TreeStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequentialy,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view. Finally,
it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk3-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

# `TreeStore` as `Buildable`

The `TreeStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a tree store:

```text
<object class="GtkTreeStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html), [`TreeModelExt`](trait.TreeModelExt.html), [`TreeSortableExt`](trait.TreeSortableExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn new -->
Creates a new tree store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_tree_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF);` will create a new `TreeStore` with three columns, of type
`gint`, `gchararray`, and `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn newv -->
Non vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will append the
new row after the last child of `parent`, otherwise it will append a row to
the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStore::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from `self`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. If parent is non-`None`, then the row will be
made a child of `parent`. Otherwise, the row will be created at the toplevel.
If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows at that level, then
the new row will be inserted to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed
to point to this new row. The row will be empty after this function is
called. To fill in values, you need to call `TreeStore::set` or
`TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be prepended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStore::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be appended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStore::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows on the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with
the values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values (tree_store, iter, position, ...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
gtk_tree_store_insert (tree_store, iter, position);
gtk_tree_store_set (tree_store, iter, ...);
```
with the different that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and if the tree store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`TreeStore::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted tree store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing rows
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `TreeStore::insert_with_values` which takes
the columns and values as two arrays, instead of varargs. This
function is mainly intended for language bindings.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`

## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn is_ancestor -->

parent (or grandparent or great-grandparent) of `descendant`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`
## `descendant`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true`, if `iter` is an ancestor of `descendant`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn iter_depth -->
Returns the depth of `iter`. This will be 0 for anything on the root level, 1
for anything down a level, etc.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

The depth of `iter`

WARNING: This function is slow. Only use it for debugging and/or testing
purposes.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `TreeStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be moved
to the start of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`.
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be
moved to the end of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will prepend
the new row before the first child of `parent`, otherwise it will prepend a row
to the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row
will be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to
call `TreeStore::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn remove -->
Removes `iter` from `self`. After being removed, `iter` is set to the
next valid row at that level, or invalidated if it previously pointed to the
last one.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is still valid, `false` if not.
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn reorder -->
Reorders the children of `parent` in `self` to follow the order
indicated by `new_order`. Note that this function only works with
unsorted stores.
## `parent`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new position of each child
 to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`.
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write
`gtk_tree_store_set (store, iter, 0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from
`TreeStore`, and should only be used when constructing a new
`TreeStore`. It will not function after a row has been added,
or a method on the `TreeModel` interface is called.
## `n_columns`
Number of columns for the tree store
## `types`
An array of `glib::Type` types, one for each column
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn set_valist -->
See `TreeStore::set`; this version takes a va_list for
use by language bindings.
## `iter`

## `value`
new value for the cell
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn set_valuesv -->

the columns and values as two arrays, instead of varargs. This
function is mainly intended for language bindings or in case
the number of columns to change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`

## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct TreeView -->
Widget that displays any object that implements the `TreeModel` interface.

Please refer to the
[tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related
to the tree widget and how they work together.

Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the `TreeView` API.
These are:

![](tree-view-coordinates.png)

Coordinate systems in `TreeView` API:

- Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).

- Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that `TreeView` renders to.

- Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of `TreeView`. These
 coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.

Several functions are available for converting between the different
coordinate systems. The most common translations are between widget and bin
window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
former you can use `TreeView::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`
(and vice versa), for the latter `TreeView::convert_bin_window_to_tree_coords`
(and vice versa).

# `TreeView` as `Buildable`

The `TreeView` implementation of the `Buildable` interface accepts
`TreeViewColumn` objects as `<child>` elements and exposes the internal
`TreeSelection` in UI definitions.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `TreeView`:

```text
<object class="GtkTreeView" id="treeview">
  <property name="model">liststore1</property>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn" id="test-column">
      <property name="title">Test</property>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkCellRendererText" id="test-renderer"/>
        <attributes>
          <attribute name="text">1</attribute>
        </attributes>
      </child>
    </object>
  </child>
  <child internal-child="selection">
    <object class="GtkTreeSelection" id="selection">
      <signal name="changed" handler="on_treeview_selection_changed"/>
    </object>
  </child>
</object>
```

<!-- impl TreeView::fn get_background_area -->
Fills the bounding rectangle in bin_window coordinates for the cell at the
row specified by `path` and the column specified by `column`. If `path` is
`None`, or points to a node not found in the tree, the `y` and `height` fields of
the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The returned rectangle is equivalent to the
`background_area` passed to `CellRendererExt::render`. These background
areas tile to cover the entire bin window. Contrast with the `cell_area`,
returned by `TreeView::get_cell_area`, which returns only the cell
itself, excluding surrounding borders and the tree expander area.

`None`, or points to a path not currently displayed, the `y` and `height` fields
of the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The sum of all cell rects does not cover the
entire tree; there are extra pixels in between rows, for example. The
returned rectangle is equivalent to the `cell_area` passed to
`CellRendererExt::render`. This function is only valid if `self` is
realized.
## `path`

<!-- impl TreeView::fn get_path_at_pos -->
Finds the path at the point (`x`, `y`), relative to bin_window coordinates
(please see `TreeView::get_bin_window`).
That is, `x` and `y` are relative to an events coordinates. `x` and `y` must
come from an event on the `self` only where `event->window ==
gtk_tree_view_get_bin_window ()`. It is primarily for
things like popup menus. If `path` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the `TreePath` at that point. This path should be freed with
`TreePath::free`. If `column` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the column at that point. `cell_x` and `cell_y` return the coordinates
relative to the cell background (i.e. the `background_area` passed to
`CellRendererExt::render`). This function is only meaningful if
`self` is realized. Therefore this function will always return `false`
if `self` is not realized or does not have a model.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeView::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

the index of the tooltip column that is currently being
used, or -1 if this is disabled.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn get_tooltip_context -->
This function is supposed to be used in a `Widget::query-tooltip`
signal handler for `TreeView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is a tree view row at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the row returned will be the cursor row. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model. `x` and `y` will always be converted
to be relative to `self`’s bin_window if `keyboard_tooltip` is `false`.

<!-- impl TreeView::fn is_blank_at_pos -->
Determine whether the point (`x`, `y`) in `self` is blank, that is no
cell content nor an expander arrow is drawn at the location. If so, the
location can be considered as the background. You might wish to take
special action on clicks on the background, such as clearing a current
selection, having a custom context menu or starting rubber banding.

The `x` and `y` coordinate that are provided must be relative to bin_window
coordinates. That is, `x` and `y` must come from an event on `self`
where `event->window == gtk_tree_view_get_bin_window ()`.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeView::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

The `path`, `column`, `cell_x` and `cell_y` arguments will be filled in
likewise as for `TreeView::get_path_at_pos`. Please see
`TreeView::get_path_at_pos` for more information.

## `func`
A function to be called
## `data`
User data to be passed to the function.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn move_column_after -->

# Returns

`true` if `path` is expanded.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn scroll_to_cell -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `column` and
`path`. If `column` is `None`, then no horizontal scrolling occurs. Likewise,
if `path` is `None` no vertical scrolling occurs. At a minimum, one of `column`
or `path` need to be non-`None`. `row_align` determines where the row is
placed, and `col_align` determines where `column` is placed. Both are expected
to be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means
right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the cell onto the screen.
This means that the cell will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the cell is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on the
model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the centered
path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the row to move to, or `None`.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to move horizontally to, or `None`.
## `use_align`

## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the row specified by `path`.
## `col_align`
The horizontal alignment of the column specified by `column`.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn scroll_to_point -->
Scrolls the tree view such that the top-left corner of the visible
area is `tree_x`, `tree_y`, where `tree_x` and `tree_y` are specified
in tree coordinates. The `self` must be realized before
this function is called. If it isn't, you probably want to be
using `TreeView::scroll_to_cell`.

If either `tree_x` or `tree_y` are -1, then that direction isn’t scrolled.
## `tree_x`
X coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
## `tree_y`
Y coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->

<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_column_drag_function -->
Sets a user function for determining where a column may be dropped when
dragged. This function is called on every column pair in turn at the
beginning of a column drag to determine where a drop can take place. The
arguments passed to `func` are: the `self`, the `TreeViewColumn` being
dragged, the two `TreeViewColumn` s determining the drop spot, and
`user_data`. If either of the `TreeViewColumn` arguments for the drop spot
are `None`, then they indicate an edge. If `func` is set to be `None`, then
`self` reverts to the default behavior of allowing all columns to be
dropped everywhere.
## `func`
A function to determine which columns are reorderable, or `None`.
## `user_data`
User data to be passed to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier for `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. Additionally, if `focus_column` is specified, and `start_editing` is
`true`, then editing should be started in the specified cell.
This function is often followed by `Widget::grab_focus` (`self`)
in order to give keyboard focus to the widget. Please note that editing
can only happen when the widget is realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `focus_column`
A `TreeViewColumn`, or `None`
## `start_editing`
`true` if the specified cell should start being edited.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_cursor_on_cell -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. If `focus_column` and `focus_cell` are not `None`, and `focus_column`
contains 2 or more editable or activatable cells, then focus is given to
the cell specified by `focus_cell`. Additionally, if `focus_column` is
specified, and `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be started in
the specified cell. This function is often followed by
`Widget::grab_focus` (`self`) in order to give keyboard focus to the
widget. Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is
realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.

<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `TreeView`. If the `self` already has a model
set, it will remove it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`,
then it will unset the old model.
## `model`
The model.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder
models that support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the
`TreeDragDestIface`. Both `TreeStore` and `ListStore` support
these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then the user can reorder the
model by dragging and dropping rows. The developer can listen to
these changes by connecting to the model’s `TreeModel::row-inserted`
and `TreeModel::row-deleted` signals. The reordering is implemented
by setting up the tree view as a drag source and destination.
Therefore, drag and drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any
other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the tree can be reordered.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_row_separator_func -->
Sets the row separator function, which is used to determine
whether a row should be drawn as a separator. If the row separator
function is `None`, no separators are drawn. This is the default value.
## `func`
a ``GtkTreeViewRowSeparatorFunc``
## `data`
user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_rubber_banding -->
Enables or disables rubber banding in `self`. If the selection mode
is `SelectionMode::Multiple`, rubber banding will allow the user to select
multiple rows by dragging the mouse.
## `enable`
`true` to enable rubber banding
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_rules_hint -->
Sets a hint for the theme to draw even/odd rows in the `self`
with different colors, also known as "zebra striping".

This function tells the GTK+ theme that the user interface for your
application requires users to read across tree rows and associate
cells with one another.

Do not use it just because you prefer the appearance of the ruled
tree; that’s a question for the theme. Some themes will draw tree
rows in alternating colors even when rules are turned off, and
users who prefer that appearance all the time can choose those
themes. You should call this function only as a semantic hint to
the theme engine that your tree makes alternating colors useful
from a functional standpoint (since it has lots of columns,
generally).

# Deprecated since 3.14

## `setting`
`true` if the tree requires reading across rows
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_search_column -->
Sets `column` as the column where the interactive search code should
search in for the current model.

If the search column is set, users can use the “start-interactive-search”
key binding to bring up search popup. The enable-search property controls
whether simply typing text will also start an interactive search.

Note that `column` refers to a column of the current model. The search
column is reset to -1 when the model is changed.
## `column`
the column of the model to search in, or -1 to disable searching
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_search_entry -->
Sets the entry which the interactive search code will use for this
`self`. This is useful when you want to provide a search entry
in our interface at all time at a fixed position. Passing `None` for
`entry` will make the interactive search code use the built-in popup
entry again.
## `entry`
the entry the interactive search code of `self` should use or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_search_equal_func -->
Sets the compare function for the interactive search capabilities; note
that somewhat like `strcmp` returning 0 for equality
``GtkTreeViewSearchEqualFunc`` returns `false` on matches.
## `search_equal_func`
the compare function to use during the search
## `search_user_data`
user data to pass to `search_equal_func`, or `None`
## `search_destroy`
Destroy notifier for `search_user_data`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_search_position_func -->
Sets the function to use when positioning the search dialog.
## `func`
the function to use to position the search dialog, or `None`
 to use the default search position function
## `data`
user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_show_expanders -->
Sets whether to draw and enable expanders and indent child rows in
`self`. When disabled there will be no expanders visible in trees
and there will be no way to expand and collapse rows by default. Also
note that hiding the expanders will disable the default indentation. You
can set a custom indentation in this case using
`TreeView::set_level_indentation`.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `enabled`
`true` to enable expander drawing, `false` otherwise.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_tooltip_cell -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area `path`, `column` and `cell` have
in common. For example if `path` is `None` and `column` is set, the tip
area will be set to the full area covered by `column`. See also
`Tooltip::set_tip_area`.

Note that if `path` is not specified and `cell` is set and part of a column
containing the expander, the tooltip might not show and hide at the correct
position. In such cases `path` must be set to the current node under the
mouse cursor for this function to operate correctly.

See also `TreeView::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath` or `None`
## `column`
a `TreeViewColumn` or `None`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full rows, you
can use this function to have `TreeView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_tooltip_row -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the row at `path`.
See also `TreeView::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn set_vadjustment -->
Sets the `Adjustment` for the current vertical aspect.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `Scrollable::set_vadjustment`
## `adjustment`
The `Adjustment` to set, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeView::fn unset_rows_drag_dest -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeView::enable_model_drag_dest`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- impl TreeView::fn unset_rows_drag_source -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeView::enable_model_drag_source`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- struct TreeViewColumn -->
The `TreeViewColumn` object represents a visible column in a `TreeView` widget.
It allows to set properties of the column header, and functions as a holding pen for
the cell renderers which determine how the data in the column is displayed.

Please refer to the [tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related to the tree widget and how
they work together.

# Implements

the `CellArea` that the newly created column should use to layout cells.

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn new_with_attributes -->
Creates a new `TreeViewColumn` with a number of default values.
This is equivalent to calling `TreeViewColumn::set_title`,
`TreeViewColumn::pack_start`, and
`TreeViewColumn::set_attributes` on the newly created `TreeViewColumn`.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 enum { TEXT_COLUMN, COLOR_COLUMN, N_COLUMNS };
 ...
 {
   GtkTreeViewColumn *column;
   GtkCellRenderer   *renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new ();
 
   column = gtk_tree_view_column_new_with_attributes ("Title",
                                                      renderer,
                                                      "text", TEXT_COLUMN,
                                                      "foreground", COLOR_COLUMN,
                                                      NULL);
 }
```
## `title`
The title to set the header to
## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`. The `column` is the
column of the model to get a value from, and the `attribute` is the
parameter on `cell_renderer` to be set from the value. So for example
if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from
column 2.
## `cell_renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to set attributes on
## `attribute`
An attribute on the renderer
## `column`
The column position on the model to get the attribute from.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_get_position -->

<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_is_visible -->
Returns `true` if any of the cells packed into the `self` are visible.
For this to be meaningful, you must first initialize the cells with
`TreeViewColumn::cell_set_cell_data`

# Returns

`true`, if any of the cells packed into the `self` are currently visible
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_set_cell_data -->
Sets the cell renderer based on the `tree_model` and `iter`. That is, for
every attribute mapping in `self`, it will get a value from the set
column on the `iter`, and use that value to set the attribute on the cell
renderer. This is used primarily by the `TreeView`.
## `tree_model`
The `TreeModel` to to get the cell renderers attributes from.
## `iter`
The `TreeIter` to to get the cell renderer’s attributes from.
## `is_expander`
`true`, if the row has children
## `is_expanded`

Returns the current X offset of `self` in pixels.

# Returns

The current X offset of `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to end of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then the `cell`
is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.
## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`.
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then
the `cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn queue_resize -->
Flags the column, and the cell renderers added to this column, to have
their sizes renegotiated.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_alignment -->
Sets the alignment of the title or custom widget inside the column header.
The alignment determines its location inside the button -- 0.0 for left, 0.5
for center, 1.0 for right.
## `xalign`
The alignment, which is between [0.0 and 1.0] inclusive.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_attributes -->
Sets the attributes in the list as the attributes of `self`.
The attributes should be in attribute/column order, as in
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`. All existing attributes
are removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
## `cell_renderer`
the `CellRenderer` we’re setting the attributes of
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_cell_data_func -->
Sets the ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use for the column. This
function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping for
setting the column value, and should set the value of `self`'s
cell renderer as appropriate. `func` may be `None` to remove an
older one.
## `cell_renderer`
A `CellRenderer`
## `func`
The ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use.
## `func_data`
The user data for `func`.
## `destroy`
The destroy notification for `func_data`
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_clickable -->
Sets the header to be active if `clickable` is `true`. When the header is
active, then it can take keyboard focus, and can be clicked.
## `clickable`
`true` if the header is active.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_expand -->
Sets the column to take available extra space. This space is shared equally
amongst all columns that have the expand set to `true`. If no column has this
option set, then the last column gets all extra space. By default, every
column is created with this `false`.

Along with “fixed-width”, the “expand” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `expand`
`true` if the column should expand to fill available space.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_fixed_width -->
If `fixed_width` is not -1, sets the fixed width of `self`; otherwise
unsets it. The effective value of `fixed_width` is clamped between the
minumum and maximum width of the column; however, the value stored in the
“fixed-width” property is not clamped. If the column sizing is
`TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly` or `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, setting a
fixed width overrides the automatically calculated width. Note that
`fixed_width` is only a hint to GTK+; the width actually allocated to the
column may be greater or less than requested.

Along with “expand”, the “fixed-width” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `fixed_width`
The new fixed width, in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_max_width -->
Sets the maximum width of the `self`. If `max_width` is -1, then the
maximum width is unset. Note, the column can actually be wider than max
width if it’s the last column in a view. In this case, the column expands to
fill any extra space.
## `max_width`
The maximum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_min_width -->
Sets the minimum width of the `self`. If `min_width` is -1, then the
minimum width is unset.
## `min_width`
The minimum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_reorderable -->
If `reorderable` is `true`, then the column can be reordered by the end user
dragging the header.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the column can be reordered.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_resizable -->
If `resizable` is `true`, then the user can explicitly resize the column by
grabbing the outer edge of the column button. If resizable is `true` and
sizing mode of the column is `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, then the sizing
mode is changed to `TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly`.
## `resizable`
`true`, if the column can be resized
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sizing -->
Sets the growth behavior of `self` to `type_`.
## `type_`
The `TreeViewColumnSizing`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the logical `sort_column_id` that this column sorts on when this column
is selected for sorting. Doing so makes the column header clickable.
## `sort_column_id`
The `sort_column_id` of the model to sort on.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_indicator -->
Call this function with a `setting` of `true` to display an arrow in
the header button indicating the column is sorted. Call
`TreeViewColumn::set_sort_order` to change the direction of
the arrow.
## `setting`
`true` to display an indicator that the column is sorted
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_order -->
Changes the appearance of the sort indicator.

This does not actually sort the model. Use
`TreeViewColumn::set_sort_column_id` if you want automatic sorting
support. This function is primarily for custom sorting behavior, and should
be used in conjunction with `TreeSortable::set_sort_column_id` to do
that. For custom models, the mechanism will vary.

The sort indicator changes direction to indicate normal sort or reverse sort.
Note that you must have the sort indicator enabled to see anything when
calling this function; see `TreeViewColumn::set_sort_indicator`.
## `order`
sort order that the sort indicator should indicate
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_spacing -->
Sets the spacing field of `self`, which is the number of pixels to
place between cell renderers packed into it.
## `spacing`
distance between cell renderers in pixels.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `self`. If a custom widget has been set, then
this value is ignored.
## `title`
The title of the `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility of `self`.
## `visible`
`true` if the `self` is visible.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_widget -->
Sets the widget in the header to be `widget`. If widget is `None`, then the
header button is set with a `Label` set to the title of `self`.
## `widget`
A child `Widget`, or `None`.
<!-- enum TreeViewColumnSizing -->
The sizing method the column uses to determine its width. Please note
that `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize` are inefficient for large views, and
can make columns appear choppy.
<!-- enum TreeViewColumnSizing::variant GrowOnly -->
Columns only get bigger in reaction to changes in the model
<!-- enum TreeViewColumnSizing::variant Autosize -->
Columns resize to be the optimal size everytime the model changes.
<!-- enum TreeViewColumnSizing::variant Fixed -->

Dimensions in points.
<!-- enum Unit::variant Inch -->
Dimensions in inches.
<!-- enum Unit::variant Mm -->
Dimensions in millimeters
<!-- struct Viewport -->
The `Viewport` widget acts as an adaptor class, implementing
scrollability for child widgets that lack their own scrolling
capabilities. Use `Viewport` to scroll child widgets such as
`Grid`, `Box`, and so on.

If a widget has native scrolling abilities, such as `TextView`,
`TreeView` or `IconView`, it can be added to a `ScrolledWindow`
with `ContainerExt::add`. If a widget does not, you must first add the
widget to a `Viewport`, then add the viewport to the scrolled window.
`ContainerExt::add` does this automatically if a child that does not
implement `Scrollable` is added to a `ScrolledWindow`, so you can
ignore the presence of the viewport.

The `Viewport` will start scrolling content only if allocated less
than the child widget’s minimum size in a given orientation.

<!-- struct Widget -->
`Widget` is the base class all widgets in GTK+ derive from. It manages the
widget lifecycle, states and style.

# Height-for-width Geometry Management # {`geometry`-management}

GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.

Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
of five virtual methods:

- `WidgetClass.get_request_mode`()
- `WidgetClass.get_preferred_width`()
- `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height`()
- `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width`()
- `WidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height`()
- `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width`()

There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
height-for-width and when using it in container implementations.

The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
in the `SizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.

For example, when queried in the normal
`SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` mode:
First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
in the interface will be computed using `WidgetExt::get_preferred_width`.
Because the preferred widths for each container depend on the preferred
widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
minimum height contextual to that width using
`WidgetExt::get_preferred_height_for_width`, which will also be a highly
recursive operation. The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
(unless `Window::set_geometry_hints` is explicitly used instead).

After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
previously specified with `Window::set_default_size`). During the
recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
will be recursively executed while container widgets allocate their children.
Each container widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
depending. In this way a `Widget` will typically be requested its size
a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
requested. For this reason, `Widget` caches a small number of results
to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.

See
[`Container`’s geometry management section][container-geometry-management]
to learn more about how height-for-width allocations are performed
by container widgets.

If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
allocated size then it must support the request in both
``GtkSizeRequestModes`` even if the widget in question only
trades sizes in a single orientation.

For instance, a `Label` that does height-for-width word wrapping
will not expect to have `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height`() called
because that call is specific to a width-for-height request. In this
case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
at least enough space to fit its own content.

Here are some examples of how a `SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` widget
generally deals with width-for-height requests, for `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height`()
it will do:


```C
static void
foo_widget_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
                                 gint *min_height,
                                 gint *nat_height)
{
   if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
     {
       gint min_width, nat_width;

       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
                                                           &min_width,
                                                           &nat_width);
       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
                                                          (widget,
                                                           min_width,
                                                           min_height,
                                                           nat_height);
     }
   else
     {
        ... some widgets do both. For instance, if a GtkLabel is
        rotated to 90 degrees it will return the minimum and
        natural height for the rotated label here.
     }
}
```

And in `WidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height`() it will simply return
the minimum and natural width:

```C
static void
foo_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
                                           gint for_height,
                                           gint *min_width,
                                           gint *nat_width)
{
   if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
     {
       GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
                                                           min_width,
                                                           nat_width);
     }
   else
     {
        ... again if a widget is sometimes operating in
        width-for-height mode (like a rotated GtkLabel) it can go
        ahead and do its real width for height calculation here.
     }
}
```

Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like this:


```C
GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
                                                   &min,
                                                   &natural);
```

It will not work to use the wrapper functions, such as
`WidgetExt::get_preferred_width` inside your own size request
implementation. These return a request adjusted by `SizeGroup`
and by the `WidgetClass.adjust_size_request`() virtual method. If a
widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
to do it.

Of course if you are getting the size request for
another widget, such as a child of a
container, you must use the wrapper APIs.
Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
`SizeGroup`, and so forth.

Since 3.10 Gtk+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
has a vertical alignment of `Align::Baseline`, and is inside a container
that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.

Baseline alignment support for a widget is done by the `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width`()
virtual function. It allows you to report a baseline in combination with the
minimum and natural height. If there is no baseline you can return -1 to indicate
this. The default implementation of this virtual function calls into the
`WidgetClass.get_preferred_height`() and `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width`(),
so if baselines are not supported it doesn’t need to be implemented.

If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
as if it was `Align::Fill`, but the selected baseline can be found via `WidgetExt::get_allocated_baseline`.
If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
appears at the position.

# Style Properties

`Widget` introduces “style
properties” - these are basically object properties that are stored
not on the object, but in the style object associated to the widget. Style
properties are set in [resource files][gtk3-Resource-Files].
This mechanism is used for configuring such things as the location of the
scrollbar arrows through the theme, giving theme authors more control over the
look of applications without the need to write a theme engine in C.

Use `WidgetClass::install_style_property` to install style properties for
a widget class, `WidgetClass::find_style_property` or
`WidgetClass::list_style_properties` to get information about existing
style properties and `Widget::style_get_property`, `WidgetExt::style_get` or
`WidgetExt::style_get_valist` to obtain the value of a style property.

# `Widget` as `Buildable`

The `Widget` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<accelerator>` element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:

```C
static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...

  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
}
```

You will also need to call `WidgetExt::init_template` from the instance
initialization function:


```C
static void
foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
}
```

You can access widgets defined in the template using the
`WidgetExt::get_template_child` function, but you will typically declare
a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
name as the widget in the template definition, and call
`gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private` with that name, e.g.


```C
typedef struct {
  GtkWidget *hello_button;
  GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
} FooWidgetPrivate;

G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, hello_button);
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, goodbye_button);
}
```

You can also use `gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback` to connect a signal
callback defined in the template with a function visible in the scope of the
class, e.g.


```C
// the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
// because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
static void
hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
                      GtkButton *button)
{
  g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
}

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);
}
```

<!-- impl Widget::fn new -->
This is a convenience function for creating a widget and setting
its properties in one go. For example you might write:
`gtk_widget_new (GTK_TYPE_LABEL, "label", "Hello World", "xalign",
0.0, NULL)` to create a left-aligned label. Equivalent to
`gobject::Object::new`, but returns a widget so you don’t have to
cast the object yourself.
## `type_`
type ID of the widget to create
## `first_property_name`
name of first property to set

# Returns

a new `Widget` of type `widget_type`
<!-- impl Widget::fn get_default_direction -->
Obtains the current default reading direction. See
`Widget::set_default_direction`.

# Returns

the current default direction.
<!-- impl Widget::fn get_default_style -->
Returns the default style used by all widgets initially.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead, and
 `CssProvider::get_default` to obtain a `StyleProvider`
 with the default widget style information.

# Returns

the default style. This `Style`
 object is owned by GTK+ and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Widget::fn pop_composite_child -->
Cancels the effect of a previous call to `Widget::push_composite_child`.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `WidgetClass::set_template`, or don’t use this API at all.
<!-- impl Widget::fn push_composite_child -->
Makes all newly-created widgets as composite children until
the corresponding `Widget::pop_composite_child` call.

A composite child is a child that’s an implementation detail of the
container it’s inside and should not be visible to people using the
container. Composite children aren’t treated differently by GTK (but
see `ContainerExt::foreach` vs. `ContainerExt::forall`), but e.g. GUI
builders might want to treat them in a different way.

# Deprecated since 3.10

This API never really worked well and was mostly unused, now
we have a more complete mechanism for composite children, see `WidgetClass::set_template`.
<!-- impl Widget::fn set_default_direction -->
Sets the default reading direction for widgets where the
direction has not been explicitly set by `WidgetExt::set_direction`.
## `dir`
the new default direction. This cannot be
 `TextDirection::None`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate -->
For widgets that can be “activated” (buttons, menu items, etc.)
this function activates them. Activation is what happens when you
press Enter on a widget during key navigation. If `self` isn't
activatable, the function returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget was activatable
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_accelerator -->
Installs an accelerator for this `self` in `accel_group` that causes
`accel_signal` to be emitted if the accelerator is activated.
The `accel_group` needs to be added to the widget’s toplevel via
`Window::add_accel_group`, and the signal must be of type `gobject::SignalFlags::Action`.
Accelerators added through this function are not user changeable during
runtime. If you want to support accelerators that can be changed by the
user, use `AccelMap::add_entry` and `WidgetExt::set_accel_path` or
`MenuItemExt::set_accel_path` instead.
## `accel_signal`
widget signal to emit on accelerator activation
## `accel_group`
accel group for this widget, added to its toplevel
## `accel_key`
GDK keyval of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier key combination of the accelerator
## `accel_flags`
flag accelerators, e.g. `AccelFlags::Visible`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_device_events -->
Adds the device events in the bitfield `events` to the event mask for
`self`. See `WidgetExt::set_device_events` for details.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`
## `events`
an event mask, see `gdk::EventMask`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_events -->
Adds the events in the bitfield `events` to the event mask for
`self`. See `WidgetExt::set_events` and the
[input handling overview][event-masks] for details.
## `events`
an event mask, see `gdk::EventMask`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_mnemonic_label -->
Adds a widget to the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). Note the
list of mnemonic labels for the widget is cleared when the
widget is destroyed, so the caller must make sure to update
its internal state at this point as well, by using a connection
to the `Widget::destroy` signal or a weak notifier.
## `label`
a `Widget` that acts as a mnemonic label for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_tick_callback -->
Queues an animation frame update and adds a callback to be called
before each frame. Until the tick callback is removed, it will be
called frequently (usually at the frame rate of the output device
or as quickly as the application can be repainted, whichever is
slower). For this reason, is most suitable for handling graphics
that change every frame or every few frames. The tick callback does
not automatically imply a relayout or repaint. If you want a
repaint or relayout, and aren’t changing widget properties that
would trigger that (for example, changing the text of a `Label`),
then you will have to call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` or
`WidgetExt::queue_draw_area` yourself.

`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` should generally be used for timing
continuous animations and
`gdk::FrameTimings::get_predicted_presentation_time` if you are
trying to display isolated frames at particular times.

This is a more convenient alternative to connecting directly to the
`gdk::FrameClock::update` signal of `gdk::FrameClock`, since you don't
have to worry about when a `gdk::FrameClock` is assigned to a widget.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `callback`
function to call for updating animations
## `user_data`
data to pass to `callback`
## `notify`
function to call to free `user_data` when the callback is removed.

# Returns

an id for the connection of this callback. Remove the callback
 by passing it to `WidgetExt::remove_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn can_activate_accel -->
Determines whether an accelerator that activates the signal
identified by `signal_id` can currently be activated.
This is done by emitting the `Widget::can-activate-accel`
signal on `self`; if the signal isn’t overridden by a
handler or in a derived widget, then the default check is
that the widget must be sensitive, and the widget and all
its ancestors mapped.
## `signal_id`
the ID of a signal installed on `self`

# Returns

`true` if the accelerator can be activated.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn child_focus -->
This function is used by custom widget implementations; if you're
writing an app, you’d use `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to move the focus
to a particular widget, and `ContainerExt::set_focus_chain` to
change the focus tab order. So you may want to investigate those
functions instead.

`WidgetExt::child_focus` is called by containers as the user moves
around the window using keyboard shortcuts. `direction` indicates
what kind of motion is taking place (up, down, left, right, tab
forward, tab backward). `WidgetExt::child_focus` emits the
`Widget::focus` signal; widgets override the default handler
for this signal in order to implement appropriate focus behavior.

The default ::focus handler for a widget should return `true` if
moving in `direction` left the focus on a focusable location inside
that widget, and `false` if moving in `direction` moved the focus
outside the widget. If returning `true`, widgets normally
call `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to place the focus accordingly;
if returning `false`, they don’t modify the current focus location.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if focus ended up inside `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn child_notify -->
Emits a `Widget::child-notify` signal for the
[child property][child-properties] `child_property`
on `self`.

This is the analogue of `gobject::Object::notify` for child properties.

Also see `ContainerExt::child_notify`.
## `child_property`
the name of a child property installed on the
 class of `self`’s parent
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn class_path -->
Same as `Widget::path`, but always uses the name of a widget’s type,
never uses a custom name set with `WidgetExt::set_name`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::get_path` instead
## `path_length`
location to store the length of the
 class path, or `None`
## `path`
location to store the class path as an
 allocated string, or `None`
## `path_reversed`
location to store the reverse
 class path as an allocated string, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_expand -->
Computes whether a container should give this widget extra space
when possible. Containers should check this, rather than
looking at `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` or `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`.

This function already checks whether the widget is visible, so
visibility does not need to be checked separately. Non-visible
widgets are not expanded.

The computed expand value uses either the expand setting explicitly
set on the widget itself, or, if none has been explicitly set,
the widget may expand if some of its children do.
## `orientation`
expand direction

# Returns

whether widget tree rooted here should be expanded
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_context -->
Creates a new `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map,
font description, and base direction for drawing text for
this widget. See also `WidgetExt::get_pango_context`.

# Returns

the new `pango::Context`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_layout -->
Creates a new `pango::Layout` with the appropriate font map,
font description, and base direction for drawing text for
this widget.

If you keep a `pango::Layout` created in this way around, you need
to re-create it when the widget `pango::Context` is replaced.
This can be tracked by using the `Widget::screen-changed` signal
on the widget.
## `text`
text to set on the layout (can be `None`)

# Returns

the new `pango::Layout`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn destroy -->
Destroys a widget.

When a widget is
destroyed, it will break any references it holds to other objects.
If the widget is inside a container, the widget will be removed
from the container. If the widget is a toplevel (derived from
`Window`), it will be removed from the list of toplevels, and the
reference GTK+ holds to it will be removed. Removing a
widget from its container or the list of toplevels results in the
widget being finalized, unless you’ve added additional references
to the widget with `gobject::Object::ref`.

In most cases, only toplevel widgets (windows) require explicit
destruction, because when you destroy a toplevel its children will
be destroyed as well.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn destroyed -->
This function sets *`widget_pointer` to `None` if `widget_pointer` !=
`None`. It’s intended to be used as a callback connected to the
“destroy” signal of a widget. You connect `WidgetExt::destroyed`
as a signal handler, and pass the address of your widget variable
as user data. Then when the widget is destroyed, the variable will
be set to `None`. Useful for example to avoid multiple copies
of the same dialog.
## `widget_pointer`
address of a variable that contains `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn device_is_shadowed -->
Returns `true` if `device` has been shadowed by a GTK+
device grab on another widget, so it would stop sending
events to `self`. This may be used in the
`Widget::grab-notify` signal to check for specific
devices. See `gtk_device_grab_add`.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`

# Returns

`true` if there is an ongoing grab on `device`
 by another `Widget` than `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_begin -->
This function is equivalent to `WidgetExt::drag_begin_with_coordinates`,
passing -1, -1 as coordinates.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `WidgetExt::drag_begin_with_coordinates` instead
## `targets`
The targets (data formats) in which the
 source can provide the data
## `actions`
A bitmask of the allowed drag actions for this drag
## `button`
The button the user clicked to start the drag
## `event`
The event that triggered the start of the drag

# Returns

the context for this drag
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_begin_with_coordinates -->
Initiates a drag on the source side. The function only needs to be used
when the application is starting drags itself, and is not needed when
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set` is used.

The `event` is used to retrieve the timestamp that will be used internally to
grab the pointer. If `event` is `None`, then `GDK_CURRENT_TIME` will be used.
However, you should try to pass a real event in all cases, since that can be
used to get information about the drag.

Generally there are three cases when you want to start a drag by hand by
calling this function:

1. During a `Widget::button-press-event` handler, if you want to start a drag
immediately when the user presses the mouse button. Pass the `event`
that you have in your `Widget::button-press-event` handler.

2. During a `Widget::motion-notify-event` handler, if you want to start a drag
when the mouse moves past a certain threshold distance after a button-press.
Pass the `event` that you have in your `Widget::motion-notify-event` handler.

3. During a timeout handler, if you want to start a drag after the mouse
button is held down for some time. Try to save the last event that you got
from the mouse, using `gdk_event_copy`, and pass it to this function
(remember to free the event with `gdk_event_free` when you are done).
If you can really not pass a real event, pass `None` instead.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `targets`
The targets (data formats) in which the
 source can provide the data
## `actions`
A bitmask of the allowed drag actions for this drag
## `button`
The button the user clicked to start the drag
## `event`
The event that triggered the start of the drag
## `x`
The initial x coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate space
 of `self`. If -1 is passed, the coordinates are retrieved from `event` or
 the current pointer position
## `y`
The initial y coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate space
 of `self`. If -1 is passed, the coordinates are retrieved from `event` or
 the current pointer position

# Returns

the context for this drag
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_check_threshold -->
Checks to see if a mouse drag starting at (`start_x`, `start_y`) and ending
at (`current_x`, `current_y`) has passed the GTK+ drag threshold, and thus
should trigger the beginning of a drag-and-drop operation.
## `start_x`
X coordinate of start of drag
## `start_y`
Y coordinate of start of drag
## `current_x`
current X coordinate
## `current_y`
current Y coordinate

# Returns

`true` if the drag threshold has been passed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_image_targets -->
Add the image targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_image_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_text_targets -->
Add the text targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_text_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_uri_targets -->
Add the URI targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_uri_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_find_target -->
Looks for a match between the supported targets of `context` and the
`dest_target_list`, returning the first matching target, otherwise
returning `GDK_NONE`. `dest_target_list` should usually be the return
value from `WidgetExt::drag_dest_get_target_list`, but some widgets may
have different valid targets for different parts of the widget; in
that case, they will have to implement a drag_motion handler that
passes the correct target list to this function.
## `context`
drag context
## `target_list`
list of droppable targets, or `None` to use
 gtk_drag_dest_get_target_list (`self`).

# Returns

first target that the source offers
 and the dest can accept, or `GDK_NONE`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_get_target_list -->
Returns the list of targets this widget can accept from
drag-and-drop.

# Returns

the `TargetList`, or `None` if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_get_track_motion -->
Returns whether the widget has been configured to always
emit `Widget::drag-motion` signals.

# Returns

`true` if the widget always emits
 `Widget::drag-motion` events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set -->
Sets a widget as a potential drop destination, and adds default behaviors.

The default behaviors listed in `flags` have an effect similar
to installing default handlers for the widget’s drag-and-drop signals
(`Widget::drag-motion`, `Widget::drag-drop`, ...). They all exist
for convenience. When passing `DestDefaults::All` for instance it is
sufficient to connect to the widget’s `Widget::drag-data-received`
signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.

Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
as described in the documentation for `Widget::drag-motion`. The default
behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
with your own signal handlers. For instance `DestDefaults::Drop` causes
invokations of `gdk_drag_status` in the context of `Widget::drag-motion`,
and invokations of `gtk_drag_finish` in `Widget::drag-data-received`.
Especially the later is dramatic, when your own `Widget::drag-motion`
handler calls `WidgetExt::drag_get_data` to inspect the dragged data.

There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
`Widget::drag-motion` callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:

```C
static void
drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
             GdkDragContext *context,
             gint x,
             gint y,
             guint time)
{
  GdkModifierType mask;

  gdk_window_get_pointer (gtk_widget_get_window (widget),
                          NULL, NULL, &mask);
  if (mask & GDK_CONTROL_MASK)
    gdk_drag_status (context, GDK_ACTION_COPY, time);
  else
    gdk_drag_status (context, GDK_ACTION_MOVE, time);
}
```
## `flags`
which types of default drag behavior to use
## `targets`
a pointer to an array of
 ``GtkTargetEntrys`` indicating the drop types that this `self` will
 accept, or `None`. Later you can access the list with
 `WidgetExt::drag_dest_get_target_list` and `WidgetExt::drag_dest_find_target`.
## `n_targets`
the number of entries in `targets`
## `actions`
a bitmask of possible actions for a drop onto this `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set_proxy -->
Sets this widget as a proxy for drops to another window.
## `proxy_window`
the window to which to forward drag events
## `protocol`
the drag protocol which the `proxy_window` accepts
 (You can use `gdk_drag_get_protocol` to determine this)
## `use_coordinates`
If `true`, send the same coordinates to the
 destination, because it is an embedded
 subwindow.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set_target_list -->
Sets the target types that this widget can accept from drag-and-drop.
The widget must first be made into a drag destination with
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set`.
## `target_list`
list of droppable targets, or `None` for none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set_track_motion -->
Tells the widget to emit `Widget::drag-motion` and
`Widget::drag-leave` events regardless of the targets and the
`DestDefaults::Motion` flag.

This may be used when a widget wants to do generic
actions regardless of the targets that the source offers.
## `track_motion`
whether to accept all targets
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_unset -->
Clears information about a drop destination set with
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set`. The widget will no longer receive
notification of drags.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_get_data -->
Gets the data associated with a drag. When the data
is received or the retrieval fails, GTK+ will emit a
`Widget::drag-data-received` signal. Failure of the retrieval
is indicated by the length field of the `selection_data`
signal parameter being negative. However, when `WidgetExt::drag_get_data`
is called implicitely because the `DestDefaults::Drop` was set,
then the widget will not receive notification of failed
drops.
## `context`
the drag context
## `target`
the target (form of the data) to retrieve
## `time_`
a timestamp for retrieving the data. This will
 generally be the time received in a `Widget::drag-motion`
 or `Widget::drag-drop` signal
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_highlight -->
Draws a highlight around a widget. This will attach
handlers to `Widget::draw`, so the highlight
will continue to be displayed until `WidgetExt::drag_unhighlight`
is called.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_image_targets -->
Add the writable image targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_image_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_text_targets -->
Add the text targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_text_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_uri_targets -->
Add the URI targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `TargetList::add_uri_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_get_target_list -->
Gets the list of targets this widget can provide for
drag-and-drop.

# Returns

the `TargetList`, or `None` if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set -->
Sets up a widget so that GTK+ will start a drag operation when the user
clicks and drags on the widget. The widget must have a window.
## `start_button_mask`
the bitmask of buttons that can start the drag
## `targets`
the table of targets
 that the drag will support, may be `None`
## `n_targets`
the number of items in `targets`
## `actions`
the bitmask of possible actions for a drag from this widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_gicon -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to `icon`. See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
## `icon`
A `gio::Icon`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_name -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to a themed icon. See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
## `icon_name`
name of icon to use
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_pixbuf -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular widget
from a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`. GTK+ retains a reference for `pixbuf` and will
release it when it is no longer needed.
## `pixbuf`
the `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` for the drag icon
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_stock -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to a stock icon.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `WidgetExt::drag_source_set_icon_name` instead.
## `stock_id`
the ID of the stock icon to use
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_target_list -->
Changes the target types that this widget offers for drag-and-drop.
The widget must first be made into a drag source with
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set`.
## `target_list`
list of draggable targets, or `None` for none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_unset -->
Undoes the effects of `WidgetExt::drag_source_set`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_unhighlight -->
Removes a highlight set by `WidgetExt::drag_highlight` from
a widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn draw -->
Draws `self` to `cr`. The top left corner of the widget will be
drawn to the currently set origin point of `cr`.

You should pass a cairo context as `cr` argument that is in an
original state. Otherwise the resulting drawing is undefined. For
example changing the operator using `cairo_set_operator` or the
line width using `cairo_set_line_width` might have unwanted side
effects.
You may however change the context’s transform matrix - like with
`cairo_scale`, `cairo_translate` or `cairo_set_matrix` and clip
region with `cairo_clip` prior to calling this function. Also, it
is fine to modify the context with `cairo_save` and
`cairo_push_group` prior to calling this function.

Note that special-purpose widgets may contain special code for
rendering to the screen and might appear differently on screen
and when rendered using `WidgetExt::draw`.
## `cr`
a cairo context to draw to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn ensure_style -->
Ensures that `self` has a style (`self`->style).

Not a very useful function; most of the time, if you
want the style, the widget is realized, and realized
widgets are guaranteed to have a style already.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn error_bell -->
Notifies the user about an input-related error on this widget.
If the `Settings:gtk-error-bell` setting is `true`, it calls
`gdk::Window::beep`, otherwise it does nothing.

Note that the effect of `gdk::Window::beep` can be configured in many
ways, depending on the windowing backend and the desktop environment
or window manager that is used.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn event -->
Rarely-used function. This function is used to emit
the event signals on a widget (those signals should never
be emitted without using this function to do so).
If you want to synthesize an event though, don’t use this function;
instead, use `gtk_main_do_event` so the event will behave as if
it were in the event queue. Don’t synthesize expose events; instead,
use `gdk::Window::invalidate_rect` to invalidate a region of the
window.
## `event`
a ``GdkEvent``

# Returns

return from the event signal emission (`true` if
 the event was handled)
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn freeze_child_notify -->
Stops emission of `Widget::child-notify` signals on `self`. The
signals are queued until `WidgetExt::thaw_child_notify` is called
on `self`.

This is the analogue of `gobject::Object::freeze_notify` for child properties.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_accessible -->
Returns the accessible object that describes the widget to an
assistive technology.

If accessibility support is not available, this `atk::Object`
instance may be a no-op. Likewise, if no class-specific `atk::Object`
implementation is available for the widget instance in question,
it will inherit an `atk::Object` implementation from the first ancestor
class for which such an implementation is defined.

The documentation of the
[ATK](http://developer.gnome.org/atk/stable/)
library contains more information about accessible objects and their uses.

# Returns

the `atk::Object` associated with `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_action_group -->
Retrieves the `gio::ActionGroup` that was registered using `prefix`. The resulting
`gio::ActionGroup` may have been registered to `self` or any `Widget` in its
ancestry.

If no action group was found matching `prefix`, then `None` is returned.

Feature: `v3_16`

## `prefix`
The “prefix” of the action group.

# Returns

A `gio::ActionGroup` or `None`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_baseline -->
Returns the baseline that has currently been allocated to `self`.
This function is intended to be used when implementing handlers
for the `Widget::draw` function, and when allocating child
widgets in `Widget::size_allocate`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the baseline of the `self`, or -1 if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_height -->
Returns the height that has currently been allocated to `self`.
This function is intended to be used when implementing handlers
for the `Widget::draw` function.

# Returns

the height of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_width -->
Returns the width that has currently been allocated to `self`.
This function is intended to be used when implementing handlers
for the `Widget::draw` function.

# Returns

the width of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocation -->
Retrieves the widget’s allocation.

Note, when implementing a `Container`: a widget’s allocation will
be its “adjusted” allocation, that is, the widget’s parent
container typically calls `WidgetExt::size_allocate` with an
allocation, and that allocation is then adjusted (to handle margin
and alignment for example) before assignment to the widget.
`WidgetExt::get_allocation` returns the adjusted allocation that
was actually assigned to the widget. The adjusted allocation is
guaranteed to be completely contained within the
`WidgetExt::size_allocate` allocation, however. So a `Container`
is guaranteed that its children stay inside the assigned bounds,
but not that they have exactly the bounds the container assigned.
There is no way to get the original allocation assigned by
`WidgetExt::size_allocate`, since it isn’t stored; if a container
implementation needs that information it will have to track it itself.
## `allocation`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_ancestor -->
Gets the first ancestor of `self` with type `widget_type`. For example,
`gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)` gets
the first `Box` that’s an ancestor of `self`. No reference will be
added to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced. See note
about checking for a toplevel `Window` in the docs for
`WidgetExt::get_toplevel`.

Note that unlike `WidgetExt::is_ancestor`, `WidgetExt::get_ancestor`
considers `self` to be an ancestor of itself.
## `widget_type`
ancestor type

# Returns

the ancestor widget, or `None` if not found
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_app_paintable -->
Determines whether the application intends to draw on the widget in
an `Widget::draw` handler.

See `WidgetExt::set_app_paintable`

# Returns

`true` if the widget is app paintable
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_default -->
Determines whether `self` can be a default widget. See
`WidgetExt::set_can_default`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can be a default widget, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_focus -->
Determines whether `self` can own the input focus. See
`WidgetExt::set_can_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can own the input focus, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_child_requisition -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Obtains
`self`->requisition, unless someone has forced a particular
geometry on the widget (e.g. with `WidgetExt::set_size_request`),
in which case it returns that geometry instead of the widget's
requisition.

This function differs from `Widget::size_request` in that
it retrieves the last size request value from `self`->requisition,
while `Widget::size_request` actually calls the "size_request" method
on `self` to compute the size request and fill in `self`->requisition,
and only then returns `self`->requisition.

Because this function does not call the “size_request” method, it
can only be used when you know that `self`->requisition is
up-to-date, that is, `Widget::size_request` has been called
since the last time a resize was queued. In general, only container
implementations have this information; applications should use
`Widget::size_request`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::get_preferred_size` instead.
## `requisition`
a `Requisition` to be filled in
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_child_visible -->
Gets the value set with `WidgetExt::set_child_visible`.
If you feel a need to use this function, your code probably
needs reorganization.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped with the parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_clip -->
Retrieves the widget’s clip area.

The clip area is the area in which all of `self`'s drawing will
happen. Other toolkits call it the bounding box.

Historically, in GTK+ the clip area has been equal to the allocation
retrieved via `WidgetExt::get_allocation`.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `clip`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_clipboard -->
Returns the clipboard object for the given selection to
be used with `self`. `self` must have a `gdk::Display`
associated with it, so must be attached to a toplevel
window.
## `selection`
a `gdk::Atom` which identifies the clipboard
 to use. `GDK_SELECTION_CLIPBOARD` gives the
 default clipboard. Another common value
 is `GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY`, which gives
 the primary X selection.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object. If no
 clipboard already exists, a new one will
 be created. Once a clipboard object has
 been created, it is persistent for all time.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_composite_name -->
Obtains the composite name of a widget.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `WidgetClass::set_template`, or don’t use this API at all.

# Returns

the composite name of `self`, or `None` if `self` is not
 a composite child. The string should be freed when it is no
 longer needed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_device_enabled -->
Returns whether `device` can interact with `self` and its
children. See `WidgetExt::set_device_enabled`.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`

# Returns

`true` is `device` is enabled for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_device_events -->
Returns the events mask for the widget corresponding to an specific device. These
are the events that the widget will receive when `device` operates on it.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`

# Returns

device event mask for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_direction -->
Gets the reading direction for a particular widget. See
`WidgetExt::set_direction`.

# Returns

the reading direction for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_display -->
Get the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel window associated with
this widget. This function can only be called after the widget
has been added to a widget hierarchy with a `Window` at the top.

In general, you should only create display specific
resources when a widget has been realized, and you should
free those resources when the widget is unrealized.

# Returns

the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_double_buffered -->
Determines whether the widget is double buffered.

See `WidgetExt::set_double_buffered`

# Returns

`true` if the widget is double buffered
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_events -->
Returns the event mask (see `gdk::EventMask`) for the widget. These are the
events that the widget will receive.

Note: Internally, the widget event mask will be the logical OR of the event
mask set through `WidgetExt::set_events` or `WidgetExt::add_events`, and the
event mask necessary to cater for every `EventController` created for the
widget.

# Returns

event mask for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_frame_clock -->
Obtains the frame clock for a widget. The frame clock is a global
“ticker” that can be used to drive animations and repaints. The
most common reason to get the frame clock is to call
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, in order to get a time to use for
animating. For example you might record the start of the animation
with an initial value from `gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, and
then update the animation by calling
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` again during each repaint.

`gdk::FrameClock::request_phase` will result in a new frame on the
clock, but won’t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint a
widget, you have to use `WidgetExt::queue_draw` which invalidates
the widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the next
frame). `WidgetExt::queue_draw` will also end up requesting a frame
on the appropriate frame clock.

A widget’s frame clock will not change while the widget is
mapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) can
change the widget’s frame clock.

Unrealized widgets do not have a frame clock.

Feature: `v3_8`


# Returns

a `gdk::FrameClock` (or `None` if widget is unrealized)
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_halign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:halign` property.

For backwards compatibility reasons this method will never return
`Align::Baseline`, but instead it will convert it to
`Align::Fill`. Baselines are not supported for horizontal
alignment.

# Returns

the horizontal alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_has_tooltip -->
Returns the current value of the has-tooltip property. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.

# Returns

current value of has-tooltip on `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_has_window -->
Determines whether `self` has a `gdk::Window` of its own. See
`WidgetExt::set_has_window`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has a window, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Containers should use `WidgetExt::compute_expand` rather than
this function, to see whether a widget, or any of its children,
has the expand flag set. If any child of a widget wants to
expand, the parent may ask to expand also.

This function only looks at the widget’s own hexpand flag, rather
than computing whether the entire widget tree rooted at this widget
wants to expand.

# Returns

whether hexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.

# Returns

whether hexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_mapped -->
Whether the widget is mapped.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_bottom -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.

# Returns

The bottom margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_end -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-end` property.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

The end margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_left -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-left` property.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Use `WidgetExt::get_margin_start` instead.

# Returns

The left margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_right -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-right` property.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Use `WidgetExt::get_margin_end` instead.

# Returns

The right margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_start -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-start` property.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

The start margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_top -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-top` property.

# Returns

The top margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_modifier_mask -->
Returns the modifier mask the `self`’s windowing system backend
uses for a particular purpose.

See `gdk::Keymap::get_modifier_mask`.
## `intent`
the use case for the modifier mask

# Returns

the modifier mask used for `intent`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_modifier_style -->
Returns the current modifier style for the widget. (As set by
`Widget::modify_style`.) If no style has previously set, a new
`RcStyle` will be created with all values unset, and set as the
modifier style for the widget. If you make changes to this rc
style, you must call `Widget::modify_style`, passing in the
returned rc style, to make sure that your changes take effect.

Caution: passing the style back to `Widget::modify_style` will
normally end up destroying it, because `Widget::modify_style` copies
the passed-in style and sets the copy as the new modifier style,
thus dropping any reference to the old modifier style. Add a reference
to the modifier style if you want to keep it alive.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` with a custom `StyleProvider` instead

# Returns

the modifier style for the widget.
 This rc style is owned by the widget. If you want to keep a
 pointer to value this around, you must add a refcount using
 `gobject::Object::ref`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_name -->
Retrieves the name of a widget. See `WidgetExt::set_name` for the
significance of widget names.

# Returns

name of the widget. This string is owned by GTK+ and
should not be modified or freed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_no_show_all -->
Returns the current value of the `Widget:no-show-all` property,
which determines whether calls to `WidgetExt::show_all`
will affect this widget.

# Returns

the current value of the “no-show-all” property.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_opacity -->
Fetches the requested opacity for this widget.
See `WidgetExt::set_opacity`.

Feature: `v3_8`


# Returns

the requested opacity for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_pango_context -->
Gets a `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map, font description,
and base direction for this widget. Unlike the context returned
by `WidgetExt::create_pango_context`, this context is owned by
the widget (it can be used until the screen for the widget changes
or the widget is removed from its toplevel), and will be updated to
match any changes to the widget’s attributes. This can be tracked
by using the `Widget::screen-changed` signal on the widget.

# Returns

the `pango::Context` for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_parent -->
Returns the parent container of `self`.

# Returns

the parent container of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_parent_window -->
Gets `self`’s parent window.

# Returns

the parent window of `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_path -->
Returns the `WidgetPath` representing `self`, if the widget
is not connected to a toplevel widget, a partial path will be
created.

# Returns

The `WidgetPath` representing `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_pointer -->
Obtains the location of the mouse pointer in widget coordinates.
Widget coordinates are a bit odd; for historical reasons, they are
defined as `self`->window coordinates for widgets that return `true` for
`WidgetExt::get_has_window`; and are relative to `self`->allocation.x,
`self`->allocation.y otherwise.

# Deprecated since 3.4

Use `gdk::Window::get_device_position` instead.
## `x`
return location for the X coordinate, or `None`
## `y`
return location for the Y coordinate, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_height -->
Retrieves a widget’s initial minimum and natural height.

This call is specific to width-for-height requests.

The returned request will be modified by the
`WidgetClass`::adjust_size_request virtual method and by any
``GtkSizeGroups`` that have been applied. That is, the returned request
is the one that should be used for layout, not necessarily the one
returned by the widget itself.
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height, or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width -->
Retrieves a widget’s minimum and natural height and the corresponding baselines if it would be given
the specified `width`, or the default height if `width` is -1. The baselines may be -1 which means
that no baseline is requested for this widget.

The returned request will be modified by the
`WidgetClass`::adjust_size_request and `WidgetClass`::adjust_baseline_request virtual methods
and by any ``GtkSizeGroups`` that have been applied. That is, the returned request
is the one that should be used for layout, not necessarily the one
returned by the widget itself.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `width`
the width which is available for allocation, or -1 if none
## `minimum_height`
location for storing the minimum height, or `None`
## `natural_height`
location for storing the natural height, or `None`
## `minimum_baseline`
location for storing the baseline for the minimum height, or `None`
## `natural_baseline`
location for storing the baseline for the natural height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_height_for_width -->
Retrieves a widget’s minimum and natural height if it would be given
the specified `width`.

The returned request will be modified by the
`WidgetClass`::adjust_size_request virtual method and by any
``GtkSizeGroups`` that have been applied. That is, the returned request

## `width`
the width which is available for allocation
## `minimum_height`
location for storing the minimum height, or `None`
## `natural_height`
location for storing the natural height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_size -->
Retrieves the minimum and natural size of a widget, taking
into account the widget’s preference for height-for-width management.

This is used to retrieve a suitable size by container widgets which do
not impose any restrictions on the child placement. It can be used
to deduce toplevel window and menu sizes as well as child widgets in
free-form containers such as `Layout`.

Handle with care. Note that the natural height of a height-for-width
widget will generally be a smaller size than the minimum height, since the required
height for the natural width is generally smaller than the required height for
the minimum width.

Use `WidgetExt::get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width` if you want to support
baseline alignment.
## `minimum_size`
location for storing the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_size`
location for storing the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_width -->
Retrieves a widget’s initial minimum and natural width.

This call is specific to height-for-width requests.

The returned request will be modified by the
`WidgetClass`::adjust_size_request virtual method and by any
``GtkSizeGroups`` that have been applied. That is, the returned request
is the one that should be used for layout, not necessarily the one
returned by the widget itself.
## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width, or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_width_for_height -->
Retrieves a widget’s minimum and natural width if it would be given
the specified `height`.

The returned request will be modified by the
`WidgetClass`::adjust_size_request virtual method and by any
``GtkSizeGroups`` that have been applied. That is, the returned request
is the one that should be used for layout, not necessarily the one
returned by the widget itself.
## `height`
the height which is available for allocation
## `minimum_width`
location for storing the minimum width, or `None`
## `natural_width`
location for storing the natural width, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_realized -->
Determines whether `self` is realized.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is realized, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_receives_default -->
Determines whether `self` is always treated as the default widget
within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if another widget
is the default.

See `WidgetExt::set_receives_default`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` acts as the default widget when focussed,
 `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_request_mode -->
Gets whether the widget prefers a height-for-width layout
or a width-for-height layout.

`Bin` widgets generally propagate the preference of
their child, container widgets need to request something either in
context of their children or in context of their allocation
capabilities.

# Returns

The `SizeRequestMode` preferred by `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_requisition -->
Retrieves the widget’s requisition.

This function should only be used by widget implementations in
order to figure whether the widget’s requisition has actually
changed after some internal state change (so that they can call
`WidgetExt::queue_resize` instead of `WidgetExt::queue_draw`).

Normally, `Widget::size_request` should be used.

# Deprecated since 3.0

The `Requisition` cache on the widget was
removed, If you need to cache sizes across requests and allocations,
add an explicit cache to the widget in question instead.
## `requisition`
a pointer to a `Requisition` to copy to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_root_window -->
Get the root window where this widget is located. This function can
only be called after the widget has been added to a widget
hierarchy with `Window` at the top.

The root window is useful for such purposes as creating a popup
`gdk::Window` associated with the window. In general, you should only
create display specific resources when a widget has been realized,
and you should free those resources when the widget is unrealized.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Use `gdk::Screen::get_root_window` instead

# Returns

the `gdk::Window` root window for the toplevel for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_scale_factor -->
Retrieves the internal scale factor that maps from window coordinates
to the actual device pixels. On traditional systems this is 1, on
high density outputs, it can be a higher value (typically 2).

See `gdk::Window::get_scale_factor`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the scale factor for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_screen -->
Get the `gdk::Screen` from the toplevel window associated with
this widget. This function can only be called after the widget
has been added to a widget hierarchy with a `Window`
at the top.

In general, you should only create screen specific
resources when a widget has been realized, and you should
free those resources when the widget is unrealized.

# Returns

the `gdk::Screen` for the toplevel for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s sensitivity (in the sense of returning
the value that has been set using `WidgetExt::set_sensitive`).

The effective sensitivity of a widget is however determined by both its
own and its parent widget’s sensitivity. See `WidgetExt::is_sensitive`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_settings -->
Gets the settings object holding the settings used for this widget.

Note that this function can only be called when the `Widget`
is attached to a toplevel, since the settings object is specific
to a particular `gdk::Screen`.

# Returns

the relevant `Settings` object
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_size_request -->
Gets the size request that was explicitly set for the widget using
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. A value of -1 stored in `width` or
`height` indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitly
and the natural requisition of the widget will be used intead. See
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. To get the size a widget will
actually request, call `WidgetExt::get_preferred_size` instead of
this function.
## `width`
return location for width, or `None`
## `height`
return location for height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_state -->
Returns the widget’s state. See `Widget::set_state`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::get_state_flags` instead.

# Returns

the state of `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_state_flags -->
Returns the widget state as a flag set. It is worth mentioning
that the effective `StateFlags::Insensitive` state will be
returned, that is, also based on parent insensitivity, even if
`self` itself is sensitive.

# Returns

The state flags for widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_style -->
Simply an accessor function that returns `self`->style.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead

# Returns

the widget’s `Style`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_style_context -->
Returns the style context associated to `self`.

# Returns

a `StyleContext`. This memory is owned by `self` and
 must not be freed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_support_multidevice -->
Returns `true` if `self` is multiple pointer aware. See
`WidgetExt::set_support_multidevice` for more information.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is multidevice aware.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_template_child -->
Fetch an object build from the template XML for `widget_type` in this `self` instance.

This will only report children which were previously declared with
`WidgetClass::bind_template_child_full` or one of its
variants.

This function is only meant to be called for code which is private to the `widget_type` which
declared the child and is meant for language bindings which cannot easily make use
of the GObject structure offsets.
## `widget_type`
The `glib::Type` to get a template child for
## `name`
The “id” of the child defined in the template XML

# Returns

The object built in the template XML with the id `name`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_markup -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self`.

# Returns

the tooltip text, or `None`. You should free the
 returned string with `g_free` when done.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_text -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self`.

# Returns

the tooltip text, or `None`. You should free the
 returned string with `g_free` when done.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_window -->
Returns the `Window` of the current tooltip. This can be the
`Window` created by default, or the custom tooltip window set
using `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_window`.

# Returns

The `Window` of the current tooltip.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_toplevel -->
This function returns the topmost widget in the container hierarchy
`self` is a part of. If `self` has no parent widgets, it will be
returned as the topmost widget. No reference will be added to the
returned widget; it should not be unreferenced.

Note the difference in behavior vs. `WidgetExt::get_ancestor`;
`gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_WINDOW)`
would return
`None` if `self` wasn’t inside a toplevel window, and if the
window was inside a `Window`-derived widget which was in turn
inside the toplevel `Window`. While the second case may
seem unlikely, it actually happens when a `Plug` is embedded
inside a `Socket` within the same application.

To reliably find the toplevel `Window`, use
`WidgetExt::get_toplevel` and call `WidgetExt::is_toplevel`
on the result.

```C
 GtkWidget *toplevel = gtk_widget_get_toplevel (widget);
 if (gtk_widget_is_toplevel (toplevel))
   {
     // Perform action on toplevel.
   }
```

# Returns

the topmost ancestor of `self`, or `self` itself
 if there’s no ancestor.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_valign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:valign` property.

For backwards compatibility reasons this method will never return
`Align::Baseline`, but instead it will convert it to
`Align::Fill`. If your widget want to support baseline aligned
children it must use `WidgetExt::get_valign_with_baseline`, or
`g_object_get (widget, "valign", &value, NULL)`, which will
also report the true value.

# Returns

the vertical alignment of `self`, ignoring baseline alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_valign_with_baseline -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:valign` property, including
`Align::Baseline`.

Feature: `v3_10`


# Returns

the vertical alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_vexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand_set` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_visible -->
Determines whether the widget is visible. If you want to
take into account whether the widget’s parent is also marked as
visible, use `WidgetExt::is_visible` instead.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See `WidgetExt::set_visible`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_visual -->
Gets the visual that will be used to render `self`.

# Returns

the visual for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_window -->
Returns the widget’s window if it is realized, `None` otherwise

# Returns

`self`’s window.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_add -->
Makes `self` the current grabbed widget.

This means that interaction with other widgets in the same
application is blocked and mouse as well as keyboard events
are delivered to this widget.

If `self` is not sensitive, it is not set as the current
grabbed widget and this function does nothing.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_default -->
Causes `self` to become the default widget. `self` must be able to be
a default widget; typically you would ensure this yourself
by calling `WidgetExt::set_can_default` with a `true` value.
The default widget is activated when
the user presses Enter in a window. Default widgets must be
activatable, that is, `WidgetExt::activate` should affect them. Note
that `Entry` widgets require the “activates-default” property
set to `true` before they activate the default widget when Enter
is pressed and the `Entry` is focused.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_focus -->
Causes `self` to have the keyboard focus for the `Window` it's
inside. `self` must be a focusable widget, such as a `Entry`;
something like `Frame` won’t work.

More precisely, it must have the `GTK_CAN_FOCUS` flag set. Use
`WidgetExt::set_can_focus` to modify that flag.

The widget also needs to be realized and mapped. This is indicated by the
related signals. Grabbing the focus immediately after creating the widget
will likely fail and cause critical warnings.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_remove -->
Removes the grab from the given widget.

You have to pair calls to `WidgetExt::grab_add` and `WidgetExt::grab_remove`.

If `self` does not have the grab, this function does nothing.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_default -->
Determines whether `self` is the current default widget within its
toplevel. See `WidgetExt::set_can_default`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is the current default widget within
 its toplevel, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_focus -->
Determines if the widget has the global input focus. See
`WidgetExt::is_focus` for the difference between having the global
input focus, and only having the focus within a toplevel.

# Returns

`true` if the widget has the global input focus.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_grab -->
Determines whether the widget is currently grabbing events, so it
is the only widget receiving input events (keyboard and mouse).

See also `WidgetExt::grab_add`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is in the grab_widgets stack
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_rc_style -->
Determines if the widget style has been looked up through the rc mechanism.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead

# Returns

`true` if the widget has been looked up through the rc
 mechanism, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_screen -->
Checks whether there is a `gdk::Screen` is associated with
this widget. All toplevel widgets have an associated
screen, and all widgets added into a hierarchy with a toplevel
window at the top.

# Returns

`true` if there is a `gdk::Screen` associcated
 with the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_visible_focus -->
Determines if the widget should show a visible indication that
it has the global input focus. This is a convenience function for
use in ::draw handlers that takes into account whether focus
indication should currently be shown in the toplevel window of
`self`. See `Window::get_focus_visible` for more information
about focus indication.

To find out if the widget has the global input focus, use
`WidgetExt::has_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget should display a “focus rectangle”
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn hide -->
Reverses the effects of `WidgetExt::show`, causing the widget to be
hidden (invisible to the user).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn hide_on_delete -->
Utility function; intended to be connected to the `Widget::delete-event`
signal on a `Window`. The function calls `WidgetExt::hide` on its
argument, then returns `true`. If connected to ::delete-event, the
result is that clicking the close button for a window (on the
window frame, top right corner usually) will hide but not destroy
the window. By default, GTK+ destroys windows when ::delete-event
is received.

# Returns

`true`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn in_destruction -->
Returns whether the widget is currently being destroyed.
This information can sometimes be used to avoid doing
unnecessary work.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is being destroyed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn init_template -->
Creates and initializes child widgets defined in templates. This
function must be called in the instance initializer for any
class which assigned itself a template using `WidgetClass::set_template`

It is important to call this function in the instance initializer
of a `Widget` subclass and not in `gobject::Object.constructed`() or
`gobject::Object.constructor`() for two reasons.

One reason is that generally derived widgets will assume that parent
class composite widgets have been created in their instance
initializers.

Another reason is that when calling `gobject::Object::new` on a widget with
composite templates, it’s important to build the composite widgets
before the construct properties are set. Properties passed to `gobject::Object::new`
should take precedence over properties set in the private template XML.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn input_shape_combine_region -->
Sets an input shape for this widget’s GDK window. This allows for
windows which react to mouse click in a nonrectangular region, see
`gdk::Window::input_shape_combine_region` for more information.
## `region`
shape to be added, or `None` to remove an existing shape
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_action_group -->
Inserts `group` into `self`. Children of `self` that implement
`Actionable` can then be associated with actions in `group` by
setting their “action-name” to
`prefix`.`action-name`.

If `group` is `None`, a previously inserted group for `name` is removed
from `self`.

Feature: `v3_6`

## `name`
the prefix for actions in `group`
## `group`
a `gio::ActionGroup`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn intersect -->
Computes the intersection of a `self`’s area and `area`, storing
the intersection in `intersection`, and returns `true` if there was
an intersection. `intersection` may be `None` if you’re only
interested in whether there was an intersection.
## `area`
a rectangle
## `intersection`
rectangle to store intersection of `self` and `area`

# Returns

`true` if there was an intersection
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_ancestor -->
Determines whether `self` is somewhere inside `ancestor`, possibly with
intermediate containers.
## `ancestor`
another `Widget`

# Returns

`true` if `ancestor` contains `self` as a child,
 grandchild, great grandchild, etc.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_composited -->
Whether `self` can rely on having its alpha channel
drawn correctly. On X11 this function returns whether a
compositing manager is running for `self`’s screen.

Please note that the semantics of this call will change
in the future if used on a widget that has a composited
window in its hierarchy (as set by `gdk::Window::set_composited`).

# Returns

`true` if the widget can rely on its alpha
channel being drawn correctly.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_drawable -->
Determines whether `self` can be drawn to. A widget can be drawn
to if it is mapped and visible.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is drawable, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_focus -->
Determines if the widget is the focus widget within its
toplevel. (This does not mean that the `Widget:has-focus` property is
necessarily set; `Widget:has-focus` will only be set if the
toplevel widget additionally has the global input focus.)

# Returns

`true` if the widget is the focus widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s effective sensitivity, which means
it is sensitive itself and also its parent widget is sensitive

# Returns

`true` if the widget is effectively sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_toplevel -->
Determines whether `self` is a toplevel widget.

Currently only `Window` and `Invisible` (and out-of-process
``GtkPlugs``) are toplevel widgets. Toplevel widgets have no parent
widget.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is a toplevel, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_visible -->
Determines whether the widget and all its parents are marked as
visible.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See also `WidgetExt::get_visible` and `WidgetExt::set_visible`

Feature: `v3_8`


# Returns

`true` if the widget and all its parents are visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn keynav_failed -->
This function should be called whenever keyboard navigation within
a single widget hits a boundary. The function emits the
`Widget::keynav-failed` signal on the widget and its return
value should be interpreted in a way similar to the return value of
`WidgetExt::child_focus`:

When `true` is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboard
navigation is Ok and/or there is nowhere we can/should move the
focus to.

When `false` is returned, the caller should continue with keyboard
navigation outside the widget, e.g. by calling
`WidgetExt::child_focus` on the widget’s toplevel.

The default ::keynav-failed handler returns `true` for
`DirectionType::TabForward` and `DirectionType::TabBackward`. For the other
values of `DirectionType` it returns `false`.

Whenever the default handler returns `true`, it also calls
`WidgetExt::error_bell` to notify the user of the failed keyboard
navigation.

A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed
(either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row of
`Entry` widgets where the user should be able to navigate the
entire row with the cursor keys, as e.g. known from user interfaces
that require entering license keys.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, `false`
 if the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboard
 navigation attempt in its parent container(s).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_accel_closures -->
Lists the closures used by `self` for accelerator group connections
with `AccelGroup::connect_by_path` or `AccelGroup::connect`.
The closures can be used to monitor accelerator changes on `self`,
by connecting to the `AccelGroup::accel-changed` signal of the
`AccelGroup` of a closure which can be found out with
`AccelGroup::from_accel_closure`.

# Returns


 a newly allocated `glib::List` of closures
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_action_prefixes -->
Retrieves a `None`-terminated array of strings containing the prefixes of
`gio::ActionGroup`'s available to `self`.

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of strings.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_mnemonic_labels -->
Returns a newly allocated list of the widgets, normally labels, for
which this widget is the target of a mnemonic (see for example,
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`).

The widgets in the list are not individually referenced. If you
want to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you
must call `g_list_foreach (result,
(GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and then unref all the
widgets afterwards.

# Returns

the list of
 mnemonic labels; free this list
 with `glib::List::free` when you are done with it.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn map -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be mapped if it isn’t already.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn mnemonic_activate -->
Emits the `Widget::mnemonic-activate` signal.

The default handler for this signal activates the `self` if
`group_cycling` is `false`, and just grabs the focus if `group_cycling`
is `true`.
## `group_cycling`
`true` if there are other widgets with the same mnemonic

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_base -->
Sets the base color for a widget in a particular state.
All other style values are left untouched. The base color
is the background color used along with the text color
(see `Widget::modify_text`) for widgets such as `Entry`
and `TextView`. See also `Widget::modify_style`.

> Note that “no window” widgets (which have the `GTK_NO_WINDOW`
> flag set) draw on their parent container’s window and thus may
> not draw any background themselves. This is the case for e.g.
> `Label`.
>
> To modify the background of such widgets, you have to set the
> base color on their parent; if you want to set the background
> of a rectangular area around a label, try placing the label in
> a `EventBox` widget and setting the base color on that.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::override_background_color` instead
## `state`
the state for which to set the base color
## `color`
the color to assign (does not need to
 be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to of `Widget::modify_base`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_bg -->
Sets the background color for a widget in a particular state.

All other style values are left untouched.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

## `state`
the state for which to set the background color
## `color`
the color to assign (does not need
 to be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to of `Widget::modify_bg`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_cursor -->
Sets the cursor color to use in a widget, overriding the `Widget`
cursor-color and secondary-cursor-color
style properties.

All other style values are left untouched.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::override_cursor` instead.
## `primary`
the color to use for primary cursor (does not
 need to be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to of `Widget::modify_cursor`.
## `secondary`
the color to use for secondary cursor (does
 not need to be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of
 previous calls to of `Widget::modify_cursor`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_fg -->
Sets the foreground color for a widget in a particular state.

All other style values are left untouched.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::override_color` instead
## `state`
the state for which to set the foreground color
## `color`
the color to assign (does not need to be allocated),
 or `None` to undo the effect of previous calls to
 of `Widget::modify_fg`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_font -->
Sets the font to use for a widget.

All other style values are left untouched.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::override_font` instead
## `font_desc`
the font description to use, or `None`
 to undo the effect of previous calls to `Widget::modify_font`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_style -->
Modifies style values on the widget.

Modifications made using this technique take precedence over
style values set via an RC file, however, they will be overridden
if a style is explicitly set on the widget using `Widget::set_style`.
The `RcStyle`-struct is designed so each field can either be
set or unset, so it is possible, using this function, to modify some
style values and leave the others unchanged.

Note that modifications made with this function are not cumulative
with previous calls to `Widget::modify_style` or with such
functions as `Widget::modify_fg`. If you wish to retain
previous values, you must first call `Widget::get_modifier_style`,
make your modifications to the returned style, then call
`Widget::modify_style` with that style. On the other hand,
if you first call `Widget::modify_style`, subsequent calls
to such functions `Widget::modify_fg` will have a cumulative
effect with the initial modifications.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` with a custom `StyleProvider` instead
## `style`
the `RcStyle`-struct holding the style modifications
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn modify_text -->
Sets the text color for a widget in a particular state.

All other style values are left untouched.
The text color is the foreground color used along with the
base color (see `Widget::modify_base`) for widgets such
as `Entry` and `TextView`.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::override_color` instead
## `state`
the state for which to set the text color
## `color`
the color to assign (does not need to
 be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to of `Widget::modify_text`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn override_background_color -->
Sets the background color to use for a widget.

All other style values are left untouched.
See `WidgetExt::override_color`.

# Deprecated since 3.16

This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
 rendering. If you wish to change the way a widget renders its background
 you should use a custom CSS style, through an application-specific
 `StyleProvider` and a CSS style class. You can also override the default
 drawing of a widget through the `Widget::draw` signal, and use Cairo to
 draw a specific color, regardless of the CSS style.
## `state`
the state for which to set the background color
## `color`
the color to assign, or `None` to undo the effect
 of previous calls to `WidgetExt::override_background_color`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn override_color -->
Sets the color to use for a widget.

All other style values are left untouched.

This function does not act recursively. Setting the color of a
container does not affect its children. Note that some widgets that
you may not think of as containers, for instance ``GtkButtons``,
are actually containers.

This API is mostly meant as a quick way for applications to
change a widget appearance. If you are developing a widgets
library and intend this change to be themeable, it is better
done by setting meaningful CSS classes and regions in your
widget/container implementation through `StyleContext::add_class`
and `StyleContext::add_region`.

This way, your widget library can install a `CssProvider`
with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` priority in order
to provide a default styling for those widgets that need so, and
this theming may fully overridden by the user’s theme.

Note that for complex widgets this may bring in undesired
results (such as uniform background color everywhere), in
these cases it is better to fully style such widgets through a
`CssProvider` with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`
priority.

# Deprecated since 3.16

Use a custom style provider and style classes instead
## `state`
the state for which to set the color
## `color`
the color to assign, or `None` to undo the effect
 of previous calls to `WidgetExt::override_color`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn override_cursor -->
Sets the cursor color to use in a widget, overriding the
cursor-color and secondary-cursor-color
style properties. All other style values are left untouched.
See also `Widget::modify_style`.

Note that the underlying properties have the `gdk::Color` type,
so the alpha value in `primary` and `secondary` will be ignored.

# Deprecated since 3.16

This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
 rendering. If you wish to change the color used to render the primary
 and seconday cursors you should use a custom CSS style, through an
 application-specific `StyleProvider` and a CSS style class.
## `cursor`
the color to use for primary cursor (does not need to be
 allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous calls to
 of `WidgetExt::override_cursor`.
## `secondary_cursor`
the color to use for secondary cursor (does not
 need to be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to of `WidgetExt::override_cursor`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn override_font -->
Sets the font to use for a widget. All other style values are
left untouched. See `WidgetExt::override_color`.

# Deprecated since 3.16

This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
 rendering. If you wish to change the font a widget uses to render its text
 you should use a custom CSS style, through an application-specific
 `StyleProvider` and a CSS style class.
## `font_desc`
the font descriptiong to use, or `None` to undo
 the effect of previous calls to `WidgetExt::override_font`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn override_symbolic_color -->
Sets a symbolic color for a widget.

All other style values are left untouched.
See `WidgetExt::override_color` for overriding the foreground
or background color.

# Deprecated since 3.16

This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
 rendering. If you wish to change the color used to render symbolic icons
 you should use a custom CSS style, through an application-specific
 `StyleProvider` and a CSS style class.
## `name`
the name of the symbolic color to modify
## `color`
the color to assign (does not need
 to be allocated), or `None` to undo the effect of previous
 calls to `WidgetExt::override_symbolic_color`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn path -->
Obtains the full path to `self`. The path is simply the name of a
widget and all its parents in the container hierarchy, separated by
periods. The name of a widget comes from
`WidgetExt::get_name`. Paths are used to apply styles to a widget
in gtkrc configuration files. Widget names are the type of the
widget by default (e.g. “`Button`”) or can be set to an
application-specific value with `WidgetExt::set_name`. By setting
the name of a widget, you allow users or theme authors to apply
styles to that specific widget in their gtkrc
file. `path_reversed_p` fills in the path in reverse order,
i.e. starting with `self`’s name instead of starting with the name
of `self`’s outermost ancestor.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::get_path` instead
## `path_length`
location to store length of the path,
 or `None`
## `path`
location to store allocated path string,
 or `None`
## `path_reversed`
location to store allocated reverse
 path string, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_compute_expand -->
Mark `self` as needing to recompute its expand flags. Call
this function when setting legacy expand child properties
on the child of a container.

See `WidgetExt::compute_expand`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_draw -->
Equivalent to calling `WidgetExt::queue_draw_area` for the
entire area of a widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_draw_area -->
Convenience function that calls `WidgetExt::queue_draw_region` on
the region created from the given coordinates.

The region here is specified in widget coordinates.
Widget coordinates are a bit odd; for historical reasons, they are
defined as `self`->window coordinates for widgets that return `true` for
`WidgetExt::get_has_window`, and are relative to `self`->allocation.x,
`self`->allocation.y otherwise.

`width` or `height` may be 0, in this case this function does
nothing. Negative values for `width` and `height` are not allowed.
## `x`
x coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw
## `y`
y coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw
## `width`
width of region to draw
## `height`
height of region to draw
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_draw_region -->
Invalidates the area of `self` defined by `region` by calling
`gdk::Window::invalidate_region` on the widget’s window and all its
child windows. Once the main loop becomes idle (after the current
batch of events has been processed, roughly), the window will
receive expose events for the union of all regions that have been
invalidated.

Normally you would only use this function in widget
implementations. You might also use it to schedule a redraw of a
`DrawingArea` or some portion thereof.
## `region`
region to draw
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_resize -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
Flags a widget to have its size renegotiated; should
be called when a widget for some reason has a new size request.
For example, when you change the text in a `Label`, `Label`
queues a resize to ensure there’s enough space for the new text.

Note that you cannot call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` on a widget
from inside its implementation of the `WidgetClass`::size_allocate
virtual method. Calls to `WidgetExt::queue_resize` from inside
`WidgetClass`::size_allocate will be silently ignored.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_resize_no_redraw -->
This function works like `WidgetExt::queue_resize`,
except that the widget is not invalidated.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn realize -->
Creates the GDK (windowing system) resources associated with a
widget. For example, `self`->window will be created when a widget
is realized. Normally realization happens implicitly; if you show
a widget and all its parent containers, then the widget will be
realized and mapped automatically.

Realizing a widget requires all
the widget’s parent widgets to be realized; calling
`WidgetExt::realize` realizes the widget’s parents in addition to
`self` itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel window
when you realize it, bad things will happen.

This function is primarily used in widget implementations, and
isn’t very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you might
need it, a better approach is to connect to a signal that will be
called after the widget is realized automatically, such as
`Widget::draw`. Or simply g_signal_connect () to the
`Widget::realize` signal.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn region_intersect -->
Computes the intersection of a `self`’s area and `region`, returning
the intersection. The result may be empty, use `cairo_region_is_empty` to
check.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Use `WidgetExt::get_allocation` and
 `cairo_region_intersect_rectangle` to get the same behavior.
## `region`
a `cairo::Region`, in the same coordinate system as
 `self`->allocation. That is, relative to `self`->window
 for widgets which return `false` from `WidgetExt::get_has_window`;
 relative to the parent window of `self`->window otherwise.

# Returns

A newly allocated region holding the intersection of `self`
 and `region`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn register_window -->
Registers a `gdk::Window` with the widget and sets it up so that
the widget receives events for it. Call `WidgetExt::unregister_window`
when destroying the window.

Before 3.8 you needed to call `gdk::Window::set_user_data` directly to set
this up. This is now deprecated and you should use `WidgetExt::register_window`
instead. Old code will keep working as is, although some new features like
transparency might not work perfectly.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `window`
a `gdk::Window`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_accelerator -->
Removes an accelerator from `self`, previously installed with
`WidgetExt::add_accelerator`.
## `accel_group`
accel group for this widget
## `accel_key`
GDK keyval of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier key combination of the accelerator

# Returns

whether an accelerator was installed and could be removed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_mnemonic_label -->
Removes a widget from the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). The widget
must have previously been added to the list with
`WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
## `label`
a `Widget` that was previously set as a mnemnic label for
 `self` with `WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_tick_callback -->
Removes a tick callback previously registered with
`WidgetExt::add_tick_callback`.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `id`
an id returned by `WidgetExt::add_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn render_icon -->
A convenience function that uses the theme settings for `self`
to look up `stock_id` and render it to a pixbuf. `stock_id` should
be a stock icon ID such as `GTK_STOCK_OPEN` or `GTK_STOCK_OK`. `size`
should be a size such as `IconSize::Menu`. `detail` should be a
string that identifies the widget or code doing the rendering, so
that theme engines can special-case rendering for that widget or
code.

The pixels in the returned `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` are shared with the rest of
the application and should not be modified. The pixbuf should be
freed after use with `gobject::Object::unref`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::render_icon_pixbuf` instead.
## `stock_id`
a stock ID
## `size`
a stock size. A size of (`IconSize`)-1 means
 render at the size of the source and don’t scale (if there are
 multiple source sizes, GTK+ picks one of the available sizes).
## `detail`
render detail to pass to theme engine

# Returns

a new pixbuf, or `None` if the
 stock ID wasn’t known
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn render_icon_pixbuf -->
A convenience function that uses the theme engine and style
settings for `self` to look up `stock_id` and render it to
a pixbuf. `stock_id` should be a stock icon ID such as
`GTK_STOCK_OPEN` or `GTK_STOCK_OK`. `size` should be a size
such as `IconSize::Menu`.

The pixels in the returned `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` are shared with the rest of
the application and should not be modified. The pixbuf should be freed
after use with `gobject::Object::unref`.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `IconTheme::load_icon` instead.
## `stock_id`
a stock ID
## `size`
a stock size. A size of (`IconSize`)-1 means
 render at the size of the source and don’t scale (if there are
 multiple source sizes, GTK+ picks one of the available sizes).

# Returns

a new pixbuf, or `None` if the
 stock ID wasn’t known
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn reparent -->
Moves a widget from one `Container` to another, handling reference
count issues to avoid destroying the widget.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Use `ContainerExt::remove` and `ContainerExt::add`.
## `new_parent`
a `Container` to move the widget into
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn reset_rc_styles -->
Reset the styles of `self` and all descendents, so when
they are looked up again, they get the correct values
for the currently loaded RC file settings.

This function is not useful for applications.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead, and `WidgetExt::reset_style`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn reset_style -->
Updates the style context of `self` and all descendents
by updating its widget path. ``GtkContainers`` may want
to use this on a child when reordering it in a way that a different
style might apply to it. See also `ContainerExt::get_path_for_child`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn send_expose -->
Very rarely-used function. This function is used to emit
an expose event on a widget. This function is not normally used
directly. The only time it is used is when propagating an expose
event to a windowless child widget (`WidgetExt::get_has_window` is `false`),
and that is normally done using `ContainerExt::propagate_draw`.

If you want to force an area of a window to be redrawn,
use `gdk::Window::invalidate_rect` or `gdk::Window::invalidate_region`.
To cause the redraw to be done immediately, follow that call
with a call to `gdk::Window::process_updates`.
## `event`
a expose ``GdkEvent``

# Returns

return from the event signal emission (`true` if
 the event was handled)
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn send_focus_change -->
Sends the focus change `event` to `self`

This function is not meant to be used by applications. The only time it
should be used is when it is necessary for a `Widget` to assign focus
to a widget that is semantically owned by the first widget even though
it’s not a direct child - for instance, a search entry in a floating
window similar to the quick search in `TreeView`.

An example of its usage is:


```C
  GdkEvent *fevent = gdk_event_new (GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE);

  fevent->focus_change.type = GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE;
  fevent->focus_change.in = TRUE;
  fevent->focus_change.window = gtk_widget_get_window (widget);
  if (fevent->focus_change.window != NULL)
    g_object_ref (fevent->focus_change.window);

  gtk_widget_send_focus_change (widget, fevent);

  gdk_event_free (event);
```
## `event`
a ``GdkEvent`` of type GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE

# Returns

the return value from the event signal emission: `true`
 if the event was handled, and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_accel_path -->
Given an accelerator group, `accel_group`, and an accelerator path,
`accel_path`, sets up an accelerator in `accel_group` so whenever the
key binding that is defined for `accel_path` is pressed, `self`
will be activated. This removes any accelerators (for any
accelerator group) installed by previous calls to
`WidgetExt::set_accel_path`. Associating accelerators with
paths allows them to be modified by the user and the modifications
to be saved for future use. (See `AccelMap::save`.)

This function is a low level function that would most likely
be used by a menu creation system like `UIManager`. If you
use `UIManager`, setting up accelerator paths will be done
automatically.

Even when you you aren’t using `UIManager`, if you only want to
set up accelerators on menu items `MenuItemExt::set_accel_path`
provides a somewhat more convenient interface.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore, if you
pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it first with
`g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
path used to look up the accelerator
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_allocation -->
Sets the widget’s allocation. This should not be used
directly, but from within a widget’s size_allocate method.

The allocation set should be the “adjusted” or actual
allocation. If you’re implementing a `Container`, you want to use
`WidgetExt::size_allocate` instead of `WidgetExt::set_allocation`.
The `WidgetClass`::adjust_size_allocation virtual method adjusts the
allocation inside `WidgetExt::size_allocate` to create an adjusted
allocation.
## `allocation`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy from
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_app_paintable -->
Sets whether the application intends to draw on the widget in
an `Widget::draw` handler.

This is a hint to the widget and does not affect the behavior of
the GTK+ core; many widgets ignore this flag entirely. For widgets
that do pay attention to the flag, such as `EventBox` and `Window`,
the effect is to suppress default themed drawing of the widget's
background. (Children of the widget will still be drawn.) The application
is then entirely responsible for drawing the widget background.

Note that the background is still drawn when the widget is mapped.
## `app_paintable`
`true` if the application will paint on the widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_default -->
Specifies whether `self` can be a default widget. See
`WidgetExt::grab_default` for details about the meaning of
“default”.
## `can_default`
whether or not `self` can be a default widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_focus -->
Specifies whether `self` can own the input focus. See
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` for actually setting the input focus on a
widget.
## `can_focus`
whether or not `self` can own the input focus.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_child_visible -->
Sets whether `self` should be mapped along with its when its parent
is mapped and `self` has been shown with `WidgetExt::show`.

The child visibility can be set for widget before it is added to
a container with `WidgetExt::set_parent`, to avoid mapping
children unnecessary before immediately unmapping them. However
it will be reset to its default state of `true` when the widget
is removed from a container.

Note that changing the child visibility of a widget does not
queue a resize on the widget. Most of the time, the size of
a widget is computed from all visible children, whether or
not they are mapped. If this is not the case, the container
can queue a resize itself.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.
## `is_visible`
if `true`, `self` should be mapped along with its parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_clip -->
Sets the widget’s clip. This must not be used directly,
but from within a widget’s size_allocate method.
It must be called after `WidgetExt::set_allocation` (or after chaning up
to the parent class), because that function resets the clip.

The clip set should be the area that `self` draws on. If `self` is a
`Container`, the area must contain all children's clips.

If this function is not called by `self` during a ::size-allocate handler,
the clip will be set to `self`'s allocation.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `clip`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy from
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_composite_name -->
Sets a widgets composite name. The widget must be
a composite child of its parent; see `Widget::push_composite_child`.

# Deprecated since 3.10

Use `WidgetClass::set_template`, or don’t use this API at all.
## `name`
the name to set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_device_enabled -->
Enables or disables a `gdk::Device` to interact with `self`
and all its children.

It does so by descending through the `gdk::Window` hierarchy
and enabling the same mask that is has for core events
(i.e. the one that `gdk::Window::get_events` returns).
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`
## `enabled`
whether to enable the device
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_device_events -->
Sets the device event mask (see `gdk::EventMask`) for a widget. The event
mask determines which events a widget will receive from `device`. Keep
in mind that different widgets have different default event masks, and by
changing the event mask you may disrupt a widget’s functionality,
so be careful. This function must be called while a widget is
unrealized. Consider `WidgetExt::add_device_events` for widgets that are
already realized, or if you want to preserve the existing event
mask. This function can’t be used with windowless widgets (which return
`false` from `WidgetExt::get_has_window`);
to get events on those widgets, place them inside a `EventBox`
and receive events on the event box.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`
## `events`
event mask
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_direction -->
Sets the reading direction on a particular widget. This direction
controls the primary direction for widgets containing text,
and also the direction in which the children of a container are
packed. The ability to set the direction is present in order
so that correct localization into languages with right-to-left
reading directions can be done. Generally, applications will
let the default reading direction present, except for containers
where the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitly
visual rather than logical (such as buttons for text justification).

If the direction is set to `TextDirection::None`, then the value
set by `Widget::set_default_direction` will be used.
## `dir`
the new direction
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_double_buffered -->
Widgets are double buffered by default; you can use this function
to turn off the buffering. “Double buffered” simply means that
`gdk::Window::begin_paint_region` and `gdk::Window::end_paint` are called
automatically around expose events sent to the
widget. `gdk::Window::begin_paint_region` diverts all drawing to a widget's
window to an offscreen buffer, and `gdk::Window::end_paint` draws the
buffer to the screen. The result is that users see the window
update in one smooth step, and don’t see individual graphics
primitives being rendered.

In very simple terms, double buffered widgets don’t flicker,
so you would only use this function to turn off double buffering
if you had special needs and really knew what you were doing.

Note: if you turn off double-buffering, you have to handle
expose events, since even the clearing to the background color or
pixmap will not happen automatically (as it is done in
`gdk::Window::begin_paint_region`).

Since 3.10 this function only works for widgets with native
windows.

# Deprecated since 3.14

This does not work under non-X11 backends,
and it should not be used in newly written code.
## `double_buffered`
`true` to double-buffer a widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_events -->
Sets the event mask (see `gdk::EventMask`) for a widget. The event
mask determines which events a widget will receive. Keep in mind
that different widgets have different default event masks, and by
changing the event mask you may disrupt a widget’s functionality,
so be careful. This function must be called while a widget is
unrealized. Consider `WidgetExt::add_events` for widgets that are
already realized, or if you want to preserve the existing event
mask. This function can’t be used with widgets that have no window.
(See `WidgetExt::get_has_window`). To get events on those widgets,
place them inside a `EventBox` and receive events on the event
box.
## `events`
event mask
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_halign -->
Sets the horizontal alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:halign` property.
## `align`
the horizontal alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_has_tooltip -->
Sets the has-tooltip property on `self` to `has_tooltip`. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.
## `has_tooltip`
whether or not `self` has a tooltip.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_has_window -->
Specifies whether `self` has a `gdk::Window` of its own. Note that
all realized widgets have a non-`None` “window” pointer
(`WidgetExt::get_window` never returns a `None` window when a widget
is realized), but for many of them it’s actually the `gdk::Window` of
one of its parent widgets. Widgets that do not create a `window` for
themselves in `Widget::realize` must announce this by
calling this function with `has_window` = `false`.

This function should only be called by widget implementations,
and they should call it in their `init` function.
## `has_window`
whether or not `self` has a window.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Call this function to set the expand flag if you would like your
widget to become larger horizontally when the window has extra
room.

By default, widgets automatically expand if any of their children
want to expand. (To see if a widget will automatically expand given
its current children and state, call `WidgetExt::compute_expand`. A
container can decide how the expandability of children affects the
expansion of the container by overriding the compute_expand virtual
method on `Widget`.).

Setting hexpand explicitly with this function will override the
automatic expand behavior.

This function forces the widget to expand or not to expand,
regardless of children. The override occurs because
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` sets the hexpand-set property (see
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set`) which causes the widget’s hexpand
value to be used, rather than looking at children and widget state.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand_set -->
Sets whether the hexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_hexpand`) will
be used.

The hexpand-set property will be set automatically when you call
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` to set hexpand, so the most likely
reason to use this function would be to unset an explicit expand
flag.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.
## `set`
value for hexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_mapped -->
Marks the widget as being realized.

This function should only ever be called in a derived widget's
“map” or “unmap” implementation.
## `mapped`
`true` to mark the widget as mapped
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_bottom -->
Sets the bottom margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.
## `margin`
the bottom margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_end -->
Sets the end margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-end` property.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `margin`
the end margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_left -->
Sets the left margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-left` property.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Use `WidgetExt::set_margin_start` instead.
## `margin`
the left margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_right -->
Sets the right margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-right` property.

# Deprecated since 3.12

Use `WidgetExt::set_margin_end` instead.
## `margin`
the right margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_start -->
Sets the start margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-start` property.

Feature: `v3_12`

## `margin`
the start margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_top -->
Sets the top margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-top` property.
## `margin`
the top margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_name -->
Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from a
CSS file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular name
in the CSS file. See the documentation for the CSS syntax (on the
same page as the docs for `StyleContext`).

Note that the CSS syntax has certain special characters to delimit
and represent elements in a selector (period, #, >, *...), so using
these will make your widget impossible to match by name. Any combination
of alphanumeric symbols, dashes and underscores will suffice.
## `name`
name for the widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_no_show_all -->
Sets the `Widget:no-show-all` property, which determines whether
calls to `WidgetExt::show_all` will affect this widget.

This is mostly for use in constructing widget hierarchies with externally
controlled visibility, see `UIManager`.
## `no_show_all`
the new value for the “no-show-all” property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_opacity -->
Request the `self` to be rendered partially transparent,
with opacity 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque. (Opacity values
are clamped to the [0,1] range.).
This works on both toplevel widget, and child widgets, although there
are some limitations:

For toplevel widgets this depends on the capabilities of the windowing
system. On X11 this has any effect only on X screens with a compositing manager
running. See `WidgetExt::is_composited`. On Windows it should work
always, although setting a window’s opacity after the window has been
shown causes it to flicker once on Windows.

For child widgets it doesn’t work if any affected widget has a native window, or
disables double buffering.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `opacity`
desired opacity, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_parent -->
This function is useful only when implementing subclasses of
`Container`.
Sets the container as the parent of `self`, and takes care of
some details such as updating the state and style of the child
to reflect its new location. The opposite function is
`WidgetExt::unparent`.
## `parent`
parent container
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_parent_window -->
Sets a non default parent window for `self`.

For `Window` classes, setting a `parent_window` effects whether
the window is a toplevel window or can be embedded into other
widgets.

For `Window` classes, this needs to be called before the
window is realized.
## `parent_window`
the new parent window.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_realized -->
Marks the widget as being realized. This function must only be
called after all ``GdkWindows`` for the `self` have been created
and registered.

This function should only ever be called in a derived widget's
“realize” or “unrealize” implementation.
## `realized`
`true` to mark the widget as realized
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_receives_default -->
Specifies whether `self` will be treated as the default widget
within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if another widget
is the default.

See `WidgetExt::grab_default` for details about the meaning of
“default”.
## `receives_default`
whether or not `self` can be a default widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_redraw_on_allocate -->
Sets whether the entire widget is queued for drawing when its size
allocation changes. By default, this setting is `true` and
the entire widget is redrawn on every size change. If your widget
leaves the upper left unchanged when made bigger, turning this
setting off will improve performance.

Note that for widgets where `WidgetExt::get_has_window` is `false`
setting this flag to `false` turns off all allocation on resizing:
the widget will not even redraw if its position changes; this is to
allow containers that don’t draw anything to avoid excess
invalidations. If you set this flag on a widget with no window that
does draw on `self`->window, you are
responsible for invalidating both the old and new allocation of the
widget when the widget is moved and responsible for invalidating
regions newly when the widget increases size.
## `redraw_on_allocate`
if `true`, the entire widget will be redrawn
 when it is allocated to a new size. Otherwise, only the
 new portion of the widget will be redrawn.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_sensitive -->
Sets the sensitivity of a widget. A widget is sensitive if the user
can interact with it. Insensitive widgets are “grayed out” and the
user can’t interact with them. Insensitive widgets are known as
“inactive”, “disabled”, or “ghosted” in some other toolkits.
## `sensitive`
`true` to make the widget sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_size_request -->
Sets the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget’s size
request will be at least `width` by `height`. You can use this
function to force a widget to be larger than it normally would be.

In most cases, `Window::set_default_size` is a better choice for
toplevel windows than this function; setting the default size will
still allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size request
will force them to leave the window at least as large as the size
request. When dealing with window sizes,
`Window::set_geometry_hints` can be a useful function as well.

Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes,
translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action
can all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it's
basically impossible to hardcode a size that will always be
correct.

The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget can
accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.
However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than
its requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more
space than it requested.

If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), then
the “natural” size request of the widget will be used instead.

The size request set here does not include any margin from the
`Widget` properties margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, and
margin-bottom, but it does include pretty much all other padding
or border properties set by any subclass of `Widget`.
## `width`
width `self` should request, or -1 to unset
## `height`
height `self` should request, or -1 to unset
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_state -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Sets the state
of a widget (insensitive, prelighted, etc.) Usually you should set
the state using wrapper functions such as `WidgetExt::set_sensitive`.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::set_state_flags` instead.
## `state`
new state for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns on flag
values in the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).

This function accepts the values `StateFlags::DirLtr` and
`StateFlags::DirRtl` but ignores them. If you want to set the widget's
direction, use `WidgetExt::set_direction`.

It is worth mentioning that any other state than `StateFlags::Insensitive`,
will be propagated down to all non-internal children if `self` is a
`Container`, while `StateFlags::Insensitive` itself will be propagated
down to all `Container` children by different means than turning on the
state flag down the hierarchy, both `WidgetExt::get_state_flags` and
`WidgetExt::is_sensitive` will make use of these.
## `flags`
State flags to turn on
## `clear`
Whether to clear state before turning on `flags`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_style -->
Used to set the `Style` for a widget (`self`->style). Since
GTK 3, this function does nothing, the passed in style is ignored.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `StyleContext` instead
## `style`
a `Style`, or `None` to remove the effect
 of a previous call to `Widget::set_style` and go back to
 the default style
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_support_multidevice -->
Enables or disables multiple pointer awareness. If this setting is `true`,
`self` will start receiving multiple, per device enter/leave events. Note
that if custom ``GdkWindows`` are created in `Widget::realize`,
`gdk::Window::set_support_multidevice` will have to be called manually on them.
## `support_multidevice`
`true` to support input from multiple devices.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_markup -->
Sets `markup` as the contents of the tooltip, which is marked up with
 the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

This function will take care of setting `Widget:has-tooltip` to `true`
and of the default handler for the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-markup` property and
`Tooltip::set_markup`.
## `markup`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_text -->
Sets `text` as the contents of the tooltip. This function will take
care of setting `Widget:has-tooltip` to `true` and of the default
handler for the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-text` property and `Tooltip::set_text`.
## `text`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_window -->
Replaces the default, usually yellow, window used for displaying
tooltips with `custom_window`. GTK+ will take care of showing and
hiding `custom_window` at the right moment, to behave likewise as
the default tooltip window. If `custom_window` is `None`, the default
tooltip window will be used.

If the custom window should have the default theming it needs to
have the name “gtk-tooltip”, see `WidgetExt::set_name`.
## `custom_window`
a `Window`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_valign -->
Sets the vertical alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:valign` property.
## `align`
the vertical alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` for more detail.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand_set -->
Sets whether the vexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`) will
be used.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set` for more detail.
## `set`
value for vexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility state of `self`. Note that setting this to
`true` doesn’t mean the widget is actually viewable, see
`WidgetExt::get_visible`.

This function simply calls `WidgetExt::show` or `WidgetExt::hide`
but is nicer to use when the visibility of the widget depends on
some condition.
## `visible`
whether the widget should be shown or not
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_visual -->
Sets the visual that should be used for by widget and its children for
creating ``GdkWindows``. The visual must be on the same `gdk::Screen` as
returned by `WidgetExt::get_screen`, so handling the
`Widget::screen-changed` signal is necessary.

Setting a new `visual` will not cause `self` to recreate its windows,
so you should call this function before `self` is realized.
## `visual`
visual to be used or `None` to unset a previous one
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_window -->
Sets a widget’s window. This function should only be used in a
widget’s `Widget::realize` implementation. The `window` passed is
usually either new window created with `gdk::Window::new`, or the
window of its parent widget as returned by
`WidgetExt::get_parent_window`.

Widgets must indicate whether they will create their own `gdk::Window`
by calling `WidgetExt::set_has_window`. This is usually done in the
widget’s `init` function.

Note that this function does not add any reference to `window`.
## `window`
a `gdk::Window`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn shape_combine_region -->
Sets a shape for this widget’s GDK window. This allows for
transparent windows etc., see `gdk::Window::shape_combine_region`
for more information.
## `region`
shape to be added, or `None` to remove an existing shape
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn show -->
Flags a widget to be displayed. Any widget that isn’t shown will
not appear on the screen. If you want to show all the widgets in a
container, it’s easier to call `WidgetExt::show_all` on the
container, instead of individually showing the widgets.

Remember that you have to show the containers containing a widget,
in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear onscreen.

When a toplevel container is shown, it is immediately realized and
mapped; other shown widgets are realized and mapped when their
toplevel container is realized and mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn show_all -->
Recursively shows a widget, and any child widgets (if the widget is
a container).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn show_now -->
Shows a widget. If the widget is an unmapped toplevel widget
(i.e. a `Window` that has not yet been shown), enter the main
loop and wait for the window to actually be mapped. Be careful;
because the main loop is running, anything can happen during
this function.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn size_allocate -->
This function is only used by `Container` subclasses, to assign a size
and position to their child widgets.

In this function, the allocation may be adjusted. It will be forced
to a 1x1 minimum size, and the adjust_size_allocation virtual
method on the child will be used to adjust the allocation. Standard
adjustments include removing the widget’s margins, and applying the
widget’s `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties.

For baseline support in containers you need to use `WidgetExt::size_allocate_with_baseline`
instead.
## `allocation`
position and size to be allocated to `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn size_allocate_with_baseline -->
This function is only used by `Container` subclasses, to assign a size,
position and (optionally) baseline to their child widgets.

In this function, the allocation and baseline may be adjusted. It
will be forced to a 1x1 minimum size, and the
adjust_size_allocation virtual and adjust_baseline_allocation
methods on the child will be used to adjust the allocation and
baseline. Standard adjustments include removing the widget's
margins, and applying the widget’s `Widget:halign` and
`Widget:valign` properties.

If the child widget does not have a valign of `Align::Baseline` the
baseline argument is ignored and -1 is used instead.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `allocation`
position and size to be allocated to `self`
## `baseline`
The baseline of the child, or -1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn size_request -->
This function is typically used when implementing a `Container`
subclass. Obtains the preferred size of a widget. The container
uses this information to arrange its child widgets and decide what
size allocations to give them with `WidgetExt::size_allocate`.

You can also call this function from an application, with some
caveats. Most notably, getting a size request requires the widget
to be associated with a screen, because font information may be
needed. Multihead-aware applications should keep this in mind.

Also remember that the size request is not necessarily the size
a widget will actually be allocated.

# Deprecated since 3.0

Use `WidgetExt::get_preferred_size` instead.
## `requisition`
a `Requisition` to be filled in
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn style_attach -->
This function attaches the widget’s `Style` to the widget's
`gdk::Window`. It is a replacement for


```text
widget->style = gtk_style_attach (widget->style, widget->window);
```

and should only ever be called in a derived widget’s “realize”
implementation which does not chain up to its parent class'
“realize” implementation, because one of the parent classes
(finally `Widget`) would attach the style itself.

# Deprecated since 3.0

This step is unnecessary with `StyleContext`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn style_get -->
Gets the values of a multiple style properties of `self`.
## `first_property_name`
the name of the first property to get
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn style_get_property -->
Gets the value of a style property of `self`.
## `property_name`
the name of a style property
## `value`
location to return the property value
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn style_get_valist -->
Non-vararg variant of `WidgetExt::style_get`. Used primarily by language
bindings.
## `first_property_name`
the name of the first property to get
## `var_args`
a va_list of pairs of property names and
 locations to return the property values, starting with the location
 for `first_property_name`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn thaw_child_notify -->
Reverts the effect of a previous call to `WidgetExt::freeze_child_notify`.
This causes all queued `Widget::child-notify` signals on `self` to be
emitted.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn translate_coordinates -->
Translate coordinates relative to `self`’s allocation to coordinates
relative to `dest_widget`’s allocations. In order to perform this
operation, both widgets must be realized, and must share a common
toplevel.
## `dest_widget`
a `Widget`
## `src_x`
X position relative to `self`
## `src_y`
Y position relative to `self`
## `dest_x`
location to store X position relative to `dest_widget`
## `dest_y`
location to store Y position relative to `dest_widget`

# Returns

`false` if either widget was not realized, or there
 was no common ancestor. In this case, nothing is stored in
 *`dest_x` and *`dest_y`. Otherwise `true`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn trigger_tooltip_query -->
Triggers a tooltip query on the display where the toplevel of `self`
is located. See `Tooltip::trigger_tooltip_query` for more
information.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unmap -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be unmapped if it’s currently mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unparent -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
Should be called by implementations of the remove method
on `Container`, to dissociate a child from the container.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unrealize -->
This function is only useful in widget implementations.
Causes a widget to be unrealized (frees all GDK resources
associated with the widget, such as `self`->window).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unregister_window -->
Unregisters a `gdk::Window` from the widget that was previously set up with
`WidgetExt::register_window`. You need to call this when the window is
no longer used by the widget, such as when you destroy it.

Feature: `v3_8`

## `window`
a `gdk::Window`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unset_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns off flag
values for the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).
See `WidgetExt::set_state_flags`.
## `flags`
State flags to turn off
<!-- enum WidgetHelpType -->
Kinds of widget-specific help. Used by the ::show-help signal.
<!-- enum WidgetHelpType::variant Tooltip -->
Tooltip.
<!-- enum WidgetHelpType::variant WhatsThis -->
What’s this.
<!-- struct Window -->
A `Window` is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
(resize it, move it, close it,...).

# `Window` as `Buildable`

The `Window` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<accel-groups>` element, which supports any number of `<group>`
elements representing the `AccelGroup` objects you want to add to
your window (synonymous with `WindowExt::add_accel_group`.

It also supports the `<initial-focus>` element, whose name property names
the widget to receive the focus when the window is mapped.

An example of a UI definition fragment with accel groups:

```text
<object class="GtkWindow">
  <accel-groups>
    <group name="accelgroup1"/>
  </accel-groups>
  <initial-focus name="thunderclap"/>
</object>

...

<object class="GtkAccelGroup" id="accelgroup1"/>
```

The `Window` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
attribute of a `<child>` element.

# Implements

[`WindowExt`](trait.WindowExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait WindowExt -->
Trait containing all `Window` methods.

# Implementors

[`ApplicationWindow`](struct.ApplicationWindow.html), [`Dialog`](struct.Dialog.html), [`Window`](struct.Window.html)
<!-- impl Window::fn new -->
Creates a new `Window`, which is a toplevel window that can
contain other widgets. Nearly always, the type of the window should
be `WindowType::Toplevel`. If you’re implementing something like a
popup menu from scratch (which is a bad idea, just use `Menu`),
you might use `WindowType::Popup`. `WindowType::Popup` is not for
dialogs, though in some other toolkits dialogs are called “popups”.
In GTK+, `WindowType::Popup` means a pop-up menu or pop-up tooltip.
On X11, popup windows are not controlled by the
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch].

If you simply want an undecorated window (no window borders), use
`WindowExt::set_decorated`, don’t use `WindowType::Popup`.

All top-level windows created by `Window::new` are stored in
an internal top-level window list. This list can be obtained from
`Window::list_toplevels`. Due to Gtk+ keeping a reference to
the window internally, `Window::new` does not return a reference
to the caller.

To delete a `Window`, call `WidgetExt::destroy`.
## `type_`
type of window

# Returns

a new `Window`.
<!-- impl Window::fn get_default_icon_list -->
Gets the value set by `Window::set_default_icon_list`.
The list is a copy and should be freed with `glib::List::free`,
but the pixbufs in the list have not had their reference count
incremented.

# Returns

copy of default icon list
<!-- impl Window::fn get_default_icon_name -->
Returns the fallback icon name for windows that has been set
with `Window::set_default_icon_name`. The returned
string is owned by GTK+ and should not be modified. It
is only valid until the next call to
`Window::set_default_icon_name`.

# Returns

the fallback icon name for windows
<!-- impl Window::fn list_toplevels -->
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows. The widgets
in the list are not individually referenced. If you want
to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you must call
`g_list_foreach (result, (GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and
then unref all the widgets afterwards.

# Returns

list of toplevel widgets
<!-- impl Window::fn set_auto_startup_notification -->
By default, after showing the first `Window`, GTK+ calls
`gdk_notify_startup_complete`. Call this function to disable
the automatic startup notification. You might do this if your
first window is a splash screen, and you want to delay notification
until after your real main window has been shown, for example.

In that example, you would disable startup notification
temporarily, show your splash screen, then re-enable it so that
showing the main window would automatically result in notification.
## `setting`
`true` to automatically do startup notification
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon -->
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that haven't
had `WindowExt::set_icon` called on them from a pixbuf.
## `icon`
the icon
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon_from_file -->
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that haven't
had `WindowExt::set_icon_list` called on them from a file
on disk. Warns on failure if `err` is `None`.
## `filename`
location of icon file

# Returns

`true` if setting the icon succeeded.
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon_list -->
Sets an icon list to be used as fallback for windows that haven't
had `WindowExt::set_icon_list` called on them to set up a
window-specific icon list. This function allows you to set up the
icon for all windows in your app at once.

See `WindowExt::set_icon_list` for more details.
## `list`
a list of `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon_name -->
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that haven't
had `WindowExt::set_icon_list` called on them from a named
themed icon, see `WindowExt::set_icon_name`.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- impl Window::fn set_interactive_debugging -->
Opens or closes the [interactive debugger][interactive-debugging],
which offers access to the widget hierarchy of the application
and to useful debugging tools.

Feature: `v3_14`

## `enable`
`true` to enable interactive debugging
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn activate_default -->
Activates the default widget for the window, unless the current
focused widget has been configured to receive the default action
(see `WidgetExt::set_receives_default`), in which case the
focused widget is activated.

# Returns

`true` if a widget got activated.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn activate_focus -->
Activates the current focused widget within the window.

# Returns

`true` if a widget got activated.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn activate_key -->
Activates mnemonics and accelerators for this `Window`. This is normally
called by the default ::key_press_event handler for toplevel windows,
however in some cases it may be useful to call this directly when
overriding the standard key handling for a toplevel window.
## `event`
a `gdk::EventKey`

# Returns

`true` if a mnemonic or accelerator was found and activated.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn add_accel_group -->
Associate `accel_group` with `self`, such that calling
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` on `self` will activate accelerators
in `accel_group`.
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn add_mnemonic -->
Adds a mnemonic to this window.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `target`
the widget that gets activated by the mnemonic
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn begin_move_drag -->
Starts moving a window. This function is used if an application has
window movement grips. When GDK can support it, the window movement
will be done using the standard mechanism for the
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch] or windowing
system. Otherwise, GDK will try to emulate window movement,
potentially not all that well, depending on the windowing system.
## `button`
mouse button that initiated the drag
## `root_x`
X position where the user clicked to initiate the drag, in root window coordinates
## `root_y`
Y position where the user clicked to initiate the drag
## `timestamp`
timestamp from the click event that initiated the drag
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn begin_resize_drag -->
Starts resizing a window. This function is used if an application
has window resizing controls. When GDK can support it, the resize
will be done using the standard mechanism for the
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch] or windowing
system. Otherwise, GDK will try to emulate window resizing,
potentially not all that well, depending on the windowing system.
## `edge`
position of the resize control
## `button`
mouse button that initiated the drag
## `root_x`
X position where the user clicked to initiate the drag, in root window coordinates
## `root_y`
Y position where the user clicked to initiate the drag
## `timestamp`
timestamp from the click event that initiated the drag
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn close -->
Requests that the window is closed, similar to what happens
when a window manager close button is clicked.

This function can be used with close buttons in custom
titlebars.

Feature: `v3_10`

<!-- trait WindowExt::fn deiconify -->
Asks to deiconify (i.e. unminimize) the specified `self`. Note
that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely deiconified
afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch])) could iconify it
again before your code which assumes deiconification gets to run.

You can track iconification via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn fullscreen -->
Asks to place `self` in the fullscreen state. Note that you
shouldn’t assume the window is definitely full screen afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could unfullscreen it
again, and not all window managers honor requests to fullscreen
windows. But normally the window will end up fullscreen. Just
don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track the fullscreen state via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_accept_focus -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_accept_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if window should receive the input focus
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_application -->
Gets the `Application` associated with the window (if any).

# Returns

a `Application`, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_attached_to -->
Fetches the attach widget for this window. See
`WindowExt::set_attached_to`.

# Returns

the widget where the window is attached,
 or `None` if the window is not attached to any widget.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_decorated -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have decorations
such as a title bar via `WindowExt::set_decorated`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have decorations
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_default_size -->
Gets the default size of the window. A value of -1 for the width or
height indicates that a default size has not been explicitly set
for that dimension, so the “natural” size of the window will be
used.
## `width`
location to store the default width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the default height, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_default_widget -->
Returns the default widget for `self`. See `WindowExt::set_default`
for more details.

# Returns

the default widget, or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_deletable -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have a close button
via `WindowExt::set_deletable`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have a close button
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_destroy_with_parent -->
Returns whether the window will be destroyed with its transient parent. See
gtk_window_set_destroy_with_parent ().

# Returns

`true` if the window will be destroyed with its transient parent.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_focus -->
Retrieves the current focused widget within the window.
Note that this is the widget that would have the focus
if the toplevel window focused; if the toplevel window
is not focused then `gtk_widget_has_focus (widget)` will
not be `true` for the widget.

# Returns

the currently focused widget, or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_focus_on_map -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_focus_on_map`.

# Returns

`true` if window should receive the input focus when
mapped.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_focus_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:focus-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if “focus rectangles” are supposed to be visible
 in this window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_gravity -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_gravity`.

# Returns

window gravity
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_group -->
Returns the group for `self` or the default group, if
`self` is `None` or if `self` does not have an explicit
window group.

# Returns

the `WindowGroup` for a window or the default group
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_has_resize_grip -->
Determines whether the window may have a resize grip.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Resize grips have been removed.

# Returns

`true` if the window has a resize grip
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_hide_titlebar_when_maximized -->
Returns whether the window has requested to have its titlebar hidden
when maximized. See gtk_window_set_hide_titlebar_when_maximized ().

# Returns

`true` if the window has requested to have its titlebar
 hidden when maximized
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_icon -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_icon` (or if you've
called `WindowExt::set_icon_list`, gets the first icon in
the icon list).

# Returns

icon for window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_icon_list -->
Retrieves the list of icons set by `WindowExt::set_icon_list`.
The list is copied, but the reference count on each
member won’t be incremented.

# Returns

copy of window’s icon list
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_icon_name -->
Returns the name of the themed icon for the window,
see `WindowExt::set_icon_name`.

# Returns

the icon name or `None` if the window has
no themed icon
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_mnemonic_modifier -->
Returns the mnemonic modifier for this window. See
`WindowExt::set_mnemonic_modifier`.

# Returns

the modifier mask used to activate
 mnemonics on this window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_mnemonics_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if mnemonics are supposed to be visible
in this window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the window is modal. See `WindowExt::set_modal`.

# Returns

`true` if the window is set to be modal and
 establishes a grab when shown
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_opacity -->
Fetches the requested opacity for this window. See
`WindowExt::set_opacity`.

# Deprecated since 3.8

Use gtk_widget_get_opacity instead.

# Returns

the requested opacity for this window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_position -->
This function returns the position you need to pass to
`WindowExt::move` to keep `self` in its current position.
This means that the meaning of the returned value varies with
window gravity. See `WindowExt::move` for more details.

If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
`gdk::Gravity::NorthWest`. This means that `WindowExt::get_position`
gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
frame for the window. `WindowExt::move` sets the position of this
same top-left corner.

`WindowExt::get_position` is not 100% reliable because the X Window System
does not specify a way to obtain the geometry of the
decorations placed on a window by the window manager.
Thus GTK+ is using a “best guess” that works with most
window managers.

Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with
respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to
its current position as returned by `WindowExt::get_position` tends
to result in moving the window slightly. Window managers are
slowly getting better over time.

If a window has gravity `gdk::Gravity::Static` the window manager
frame is not relevant, and thus `WindowExt::get_position` will
always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.

If you are saving and restoring your application’s window
positions, you should know that it’s impossible for applications to
do this without getting it somewhat wrong because applications do
not have sufficient knowledge of window manager state. The Correct
Mechanism is to support the session management protocol (see the
“GnomeClient” object in the GNOME libraries for example) and allow
the window manager to save your window sizes and positions.
## `root_x`
return location for X coordinate of
 gravity-determined reference point, or `None`
## `root_y`
return location for Y coordinate of
 gravity-determined reference point, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_resizable -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_resizable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can resize the window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_resize_grip_area -->
If a window has a resize grip, this will retrieve the grip
position, width and height into the specified `gdk::Rectangle`.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Resize grips have been removed.
## `rect`
a pointer to a `gdk::Rectangle` which we should store
 the resize grip area

# Returns

`true` if the resize grip’s area was retrieved
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_role -->
Returns the role of the window. See `WindowExt::set_role` for
further explanation.

# Returns

the role of the window if set, or `None`. The
 returned is owned by the widget and must not be modified
 or freed.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_screen -->
Returns the `gdk::Screen` associated with `self`.

# Returns

a `gdk::Screen`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_size -->
Obtains the current size of `self`. If `self` is not onscreen,
it returns the size GTK+ will suggest to the
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]
for the initial window
size (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window
manager will actually select). The size obtained by
`WindowExt::get_size` is the last size received in a
`gdk::EventConfigure`, that is, GTK+ uses its locally-stored size,
rather than querying the X server for the size. As a result, if you
call `WindowExt::resize` then immediately call
`WindowExt::get_size`, the size won’t have taken effect yet. After
the window manager processes the resize request, GTK+ receives
notification that the size has changed via a configure event, and
the size of the window gets updated.

Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition,
because the size of the window may change between the time that you
get the size and the time that you perform some action assuming
that size is the current size. To avoid race conditions, connect to
“configure-event” on the window and adjust your size-dependent
state to match the size delivered in the `gdk::EventConfigure`.

Note 2: The returned size does not include the
size of the window manager decorations (aka the window frame or
border). Those are not drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no reliable
method of determining their size.

Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to position
the window onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferred
way is to simply set the window’s semantic type with
`WindowExt::set_type_hint`, which allows the window manager to
e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
dialogs with `WindowExt::set_transient_for` window managers
will often center the dialog over its parent window. It's
much preferred to let the window manager handle these
things rather than doing it yourself, because all apps will
behave consistently and according to user prefs if the window
manager handles it. Also, the window manager can take the size
of the window decorations/border into account, while your
application cannot.

In any case, if you insist on application-specified window
positioning, there’s still a better way than
doing it yourself - `WindowExt::set_position` will frequently
handle the details for you.
## `width`
return location for width, or `None`
## `height`
return location for height, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_skip_pager_hint -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_skip_pager_hint`.

# Returns

`true` if window shouldn’t be in pager
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_skip_taskbar_hint -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_skip_taskbar_hint`

# Returns

`true` if window shouldn’t be in taskbar
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_title -->
Retrieves the title of the window. See `WindowExt::set_title`.

# Returns

the title of the window, or `None` if none has
 been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
 and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_titlebar -->
Returns the custom titlebar that has been set with
`WindowExt::set_titlebar`.

Feature: `v3_16`


# Returns

the custom titlebar, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_transient_for -->
Fetches the transient parent for this window. See
`WindowExt::set_transient_for`.

# Returns

the transient parent for this window, or `None`
 if no transient parent has been set.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_type_hint -->
Gets the type hint for this window. See `WindowExt::set_type_hint`.

# Returns

the type hint for `self`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_urgency_hint -->
Gets the value set by `WindowExt::set_urgency_hint`

# Returns

`true` if window is urgent
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn get_window_type -->
Gets the type of the window. See `WindowType`.

# Returns

the type of the window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn has_group -->
Returns whether `self` has an explicit window group.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has an explicit window group.

Since 2.22
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn has_toplevel_focus -->
Returns whether the input focus is within this `Window`.
For real toplevel windows, this is identical to `WindowExt::is_active`,
but for embedded windows, like `Plug`, the results will differ.

# Returns

`true` if the input focus is within this `Window`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn iconify -->
Asks to iconify (i.e. minimize) the specified `self`. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely iconified afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could deiconify it
again, or there may not be a window manager in which case
iconification isn’t possible, etc. But normally the window will end
up iconified. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be iconified before it ever appears
onscreen.

You can track iconification via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn is_active -->
Returns whether the window is part of the current active toplevel.
(That is, the toplevel window receiving keystrokes.)
The return value is `true` if the window is active toplevel
itself, but also if it is, say, a `Plug` embedded in the active toplevel.
You might use this function if you wanted to draw a widget
differently in an active window from a widget in an inactive window.
See `WindowExt::has_toplevel_focus`

# Returns

`true` if the window part of the current active window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn is_maximized -->
Retrieves the current maximized state of `self`.

Note that since maximization is ultimately handled by the window
manager and happens asynchronously to an application request, you
shouldn’t assume the return value of this function changing
immediately (or at all), as an effect of calling
`WindowExt::maximize` or `WindowExt::unmaximize`.

Feature: `v3_12`


# Returns

whether the window has a maximized state.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn maximize -->
Asks to maximize `self`, so that it becomes full-screen. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely maximized afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could unmaximize it
again, and not all window managers support maximization. But
normally the window will end up maximized. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be maximized when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track maximization via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`, or by listening to notifications on the
`Window:is-maximized` property.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn mnemonic_activate -->
Activates the targets associated with the mnemonic.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `modifier`
the modifiers

# Returns

`true` if the activation is done.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn move -->
Asks the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch] to move
`self` to the given position. Window managers are free to ignore
this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window
positions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) and
honor requests after the window has already been shown.

Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined
reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things:
first, the location of the reference point in root window
coordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned at
the reference point.

By default the gravity is `gdk::Gravity::NorthWest`, so the reference
point is simply the `x`, `y` supplied to `WindowExt::move`. The
top-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame or
border) will be placed at `x`, `y`. Therefore, to position a window
at the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity
(which is `gdk::Gravity::NorthWest`) and move the window to 0,0.

To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you
would set `gdk::Gravity::SouthEast`, which means that the reference
point is at `x` + the window width and `y` + the window height, and
the bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at that
reference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corner
you would first set gravity to south east, then write:
`gtk_window_move (window, gdk_screen_width () - window_width,
gdk_screen_height () - window_height)` (note that this
example does not take multi-head scenarios into account).

The [Extended Window Manager Hints Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec)
has a nice table of gravities in the “implementation notes” section.

The `WindowExt::get_position` documentation may also be relevant.
## `x`
X coordinate to move window to
## `y`
Y coordinate to move window to
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn parse_geometry -->
Parses a standard X Window System geometry string - see the
manual page for X (type “man X”) for details on this.
`WindowExt::parse_geometry` does work on all GTK+ ports
including Win32 but is primarily intended for an X environment.

If either a size or a position can be extracted from the
geometry string, `WindowExt::parse_geometry` returns `true`
and calls `WindowExt::set_default_size` and/or `WindowExt::move`
to resize/move the window.

If `WindowExt::parse_geometry` returns `true`, it will also
set the `gdk::WindowHints::UserPos` and/or `gdk::WindowHints::UserSize` hints
indicating to the window manager that the size/position of
the window was user-specified. This causes most window
managers to honor the geometry.

Note that for `WindowExt::parse_geometry` to work as expected, it has
to be called when the window has its “final” size, i.e. after calling
`WidgetExt::show_all` on the contents and `WindowExt::set_geometry_hints`
on the window.

```C
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

static void
fill_with_content (GtkWidget *vbox)
{
  // fill with content...
}

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  GtkWidget *window, *vbox;
  GdkGeometry size_hints = {
    100, 50, 0, 0, 100, 50, 10,
    10, 0.0, 0.0, GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST
  };

  gtk_init (&argc, &argv);

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  vbox = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 0);

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), vbox);
  fill_with_content (vbox);
  gtk_widget_show_all (vbox);

  gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (window),
                      window,
                    &size_hints,
                    GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |
                    GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE |
                    GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC);

  if (argc > 1)
    {
      gboolean res;
      res = gtk_window_parse_geometry (GTK_WINDOW (window),
                                       argv[1]);
      if (! res)
        fprintf (stderr,
                 "Failed to parse “%s”\n",
                 argv[1]);
    }

  gtk_widget_show_all (window);
  gtk_main ();

  return 0;
}
```
## `geometry`
geometry string

# Returns

`true` if string was parsed successfully
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn present -->
Presents a window to the user. This may mean raising the window
in the stacking order, deiconifying it, moving it to the current
desktop, and/or giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependent
on the user’s platform, window manager, and preferences.

If `self` is hidden, this function calls `WidgetExt::show`
as well.

This function should be used when the user tries to open a window
that’s already open. Say for example the preferences dialog is
currently open, and the user chooses Preferences from the menu
a second time; use `WindowExt::present` to move the already-open dialog
where the user can see it.

If you are calling this function in response to a user interaction,
it is preferable to use `WindowExt::present_with_time`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn present_with_time -->
Presents a window to the user in response to a user interaction.
If you need to present a window without a timestamp, use
`WindowExt::present`. See `WindowExt::present` for details.
## `timestamp`
the timestamp of the user interaction (typically a
 button or key press event) which triggered this call
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn propagate_key_event -->
Propagate a key press or release event to the focus widget and
up the focus container chain until a widget handles `event`.
This is normally called by the default ::key_press_event and
::key_release_event handlers for toplevel windows,
however in some cases it may be useful to call this directly when
overriding the standard key handling for a toplevel window.
## `event`
a `gdk::EventKey`

# Returns

`true` if a widget in the focus chain handled the event.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn remove_accel_group -->
Reverses the effects of `WindowExt::add_accel_group`.
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn remove_mnemonic -->
Removes a mnemonic from this window.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `target`
the widget that gets activated by the mnemonic
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn reshow_with_initial_size -->
Hides `self`, then reshows it, resetting the
default size and position of the window. Used
by GUI builders only.

# Deprecated since 3.10

GUI builders can call `WidgetExt::hide`,
 `WidgetExt::unrealize` and then `WidgetExt::show` on `self`
 themselves, if they still need this functionality.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn resize -->
Resizes the window as if the user had done so, obeying geometry
constraints. The default geometry constraint is that windows may
not be smaller than their size request; to override this
constraint, call `WidgetExt::set_size_request` to set the window's
request to a smaller value.

If `WindowExt::resize` is called before showing a window for the
first time, it overrides any default size set with
`WindowExt::set_default_size`.

Windows may not be resized smaller than 1 by 1 pixels.
## `width`
width in pixels to resize the window to
## `height`
height in pixels to resize the window to
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn resize_grip_is_visible -->
Determines whether a resize grip is visible for the specified window.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Resize grips have been removed.

# Returns

`true` if a resize grip exists and is visible
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn resize_to_geometry -->
Like `WindowExt::resize`, but `width` and `height` are interpreted
in terms of the base size and increment set with
gtk_window_set_geometry_hints.
## `width`
width in resize increments to resize the window to
## `height`
height in resize increments to resize the window to
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_accept_focus -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive
the input focus. This function sets this hint.
## `setting`
`true` to let this window receive input focus
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_application -->
Sets or unsets the `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as the window
is open.
## `application`
a `Application`, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_attached_to -->
Marks `self` as attached to `attach_widget`. This creates a logical binding
between the window and the widget it belongs to, which is used by GTK+ to
propagate information such as styling or accessibility to `self` as if it
was a children of `attach_widget`.

Examples of places where specifying this relation is useful are for instance
a `Menu` created by a `ComboBox`, a completion popup window
created by `Entry` or a typeahead search entry created by `TreeView`.

Note that this function should not be confused with
`WindowExt::set_transient_for`, which specifies a window manager relation
between two toplevels instead.

Passing `None` for `attach_widget` detaches the window.
## `attach_widget`
a `Widget`, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_decorated -->
By default, windows are decorated with a title bar, resize
controls, etc. Some [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
allow GTK+ to disable these decorations, creating a
borderless window. If you set the decorated property to `false`
using this function, GTK+ will do its best to convince the window
manager not to decorate the window. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_default -->
The default widget is the widget that’s activated when the user
presses Enter in a dialog (for example). This function sets or
unsets the default widget for a `Window`. When setting (rather
than unsetting) the default widget it’s generally easier to call
`WidgetExt::grab_default` on the widget. Before making a widget
the default widget, you must call `WidgetExt::set_can_default` on
the widget you’d like to make the default.
## `default_widget`
widget to be the default, or `None`
 to unset the default widget for the toplevel
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_default_geometry -->
Like `WindowExt::set_default_size`, but `width` and `height` are interpreted
in terms of the base size and increment set with
gtk_window_set_geometry_hints.
## `width`
width in resize increments, or -1 to unset the default width
## `height`
height in resize increments, or -1 to unset the default height
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_default_size -->
Sets the default size of a window. If the window’s “natural” size
(its size request) is larger than the default, the default will be
ignored. More generally, if the default size does not obey the
geometry hints for the window (`WindowExt::set_geometry_hints` can
be used to set these explicitly), the default size will be clamped
to the nearest permitted size.

Unlike `WidgetExt::set_size_request`, which sets a size request for
a widget and thus would keep users from shrinking the window, this
function only sets the initial size, just as if the user had
resized the window themselves. Users can still shrink the window
again as they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to
use the “natural” default size (the size request of the window).

For more control over a window’s initial size and how resizing works,
investigate `WindowExt::set_geometry_hints`.

For some uses, `WindowExt::resize` is a more appropriate function.
`WindowExt::resize` changes the current size of the window, rather
than the size to be used on initial display. `WindowExt::resize` always
affects the window itself, not the geometry widget.

The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size
it had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.

Windows can’t actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
passing 0 for `width` and `height` is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.
## `width`
width in pixels, or -1 to unset the default width
## `height`
height in pixels, or -1 to unset the default height
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_deletable -->
By default, windows have a close button in the window frame. Some
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] allow GTK+ to
disable this button. If you set the deletable property to `false`
using this function, GTK+ will do its best to convince the window
manager not to show a close button. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window as deletable
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_destroy_with_parent -->
If `setting` is `true`, then destroying the transient parent of `self`
will also destroy `self` itself. This is useful for dialogs that
shouldn’t persist beyond the lifetime of the main window they're
associated with, for example.
## `setting`
whether to destroy `self` with its transient parent
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_focus -->
If `focus` is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets
it as the focus widget for the window. If `focus` is `None`, unsets
the focus widget for this window. To set the focus to a particular
widget in the toplevel, it is usually more convenient to use
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` instead of this function.
## `focus`
widget to be the new focus widget, or `None` to unset
 any focus widget for the toplevel window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_focus_on_map -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive
the input focus when the window is mapped. This function sets this
hint.
## `setting`
`true` to let this window receive input focus on map
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_focus_visible -->
Sets the `Window:focus-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_geometry_hints -->
This function sets up hints about how a window can be resized by
the user. You can set a minimum and maximum size; allowed resize
increments (e.g. for xterm, you can only resize by the size of a
character); aspect ratios; and more. See the `gdk::Geometry` struct.
## `geometry_widget`
widget the geometry hints will be applied to or `None`
## `geometry`
struct containing geometry information or `None`
## `geom_mask`
mask indicating which struct fields should be paid attention to
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_gravity -->
Window gravity defines the meaning of coordinates passed to
`WindowExt::move`. See `WindowExt::move` and `gdk::Gravity` for
more details.

The default window gravity is `gdk::Gravity::NorthWest` which will
typically “do what you mean.”
## `gravity`
window gravity
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_has_resize_grip -->
Sets whether `self` has a corner resize grip.

Note that the resize grip is only shown if the window
is actually resizable and not maximized. Use
`WindowExt::resize_grip_is_visible` to find out if the
resize grip is currently shown.

# Deprecated since 3.14

Resize grips have been removed.
## `value`
`true` to allow a resize grip
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_has_user_ref_count -->
Tells GTK+ whether to drop its extra reference to the window
when `WidgetExt::destroy` is called.

This function is only exported for the benefit of language
bindings which may need to keep the window alive until their
wrapper object is garbage collected. There is no justification
for ever calling this function in an application.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_hide_titlebar_when_maximized -->
If `setting` is `true`, then `self` will request that it’s titlebar
should be hidden when maximized.
This is useful for windows that don’t convey any information other
than the application name in the titlebar, to put the available
screen space to better use. If the underlying window system does not
support the request, the setting will not have any effect.

Note that custom titlebars set with `WindowExt::set_titlebar` are
not affected by this. The application is in full control of their
content and visibility anyway.
## `setting`
whether to hide the titlebar when `self` is maximized
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_icon -->
Sets up the icon representing a `Window`. This icon is used when
the window is minimized (also known as iconified). Some window
managers or desktop environments may also place it in the window
frame, or display it in other contexts.

The icon should be provided in whatever size it was naturally
drawn; that is, don’t scale the image before passing it to
GTK+. Scaling is postponed until the last minute, when the desired
final size is known, to allow best quality.

If you have your icon hand-drawn in multiple sizes, use
`WindowExt::set_icon_list`. Then the best size will be used.

This function is equivalent to calling `WindowExt::set_icon_list`
with a 1-element list.

See also `Window::set_default_icon_list` to set the icon
for all windows in your application in one go.
## `icon`
icon image, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_icon_from_file -->
Sets the icon for `self`.
Warns on failure if `err` is `None`.

This function is equivalent to calling `WindowExt::set_icon`
with a pixbuf created by loading the image from `filename`.
## `filename`
location of icon file

# Returns

`true` if setting the icon succeeded.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_icon_list -->
Sets up the icon representing a `Window`. The icon is used when
the window is minimized (also known as iconified). Some window
managers or desktop environments may also place it in the window
frame, or display it in other contexts.

`WindowExt::set_icon_list` allows you to pass in the same icon in
several hand-drawn sizes. The list should contain the natural sizes
your icon is available in; that is, don’t scale the image before
passing it to GTK+. Scaling is postponed until the last minute,
when the desired final size is known, to allow best quality.

By passing several sizes, you may improve the final image quality
of the icon, by reducing or eliminating automatic image scaling.

Recommended sizes to provide: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 at minimum, and
larger images (64x64, 128x128) if you have them.

See also `Window::set_default_icon_list` to set the icon
for all windows in your application in one go.

Note that transient windows (those who have been set transient for another
window using `WindowExt::set_transient_for`) will inherit their
icon from their transient parent. So there’s no need to explicitly
set the icon on transient windows.
## `list`
list of `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_icon_name -->
Sets the icon for the window from a named themed icon. See
the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.

Note that this has nothing to do with the WM_ICON_NAME
property which is mentioned in the ICCCM.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_keep_above -->
Asks to keep `self` above, so that it stays on top. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely above afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could not keep it above,
and not all window managers support keeping windows above. But
normally the window will end kept above. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be kept above when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track the above state via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.

Note that, according to the
[Extended Window Manager Hints Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec),
the above state is mainly meant for user preferences and should not
be used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their
dialogs.
## `setting`
whether to keep `self` above other windows
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_keep_below -->
Asks to keep `self` below, so that it stays in bottom. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely below afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could not keep it below,
and not all window managers support putting windows below. But
normally the window will be kept below. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be kept below when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track the below state via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.

Note that, according to the
[Extended Window Manager Hints Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec),
the above state is mainly meant for user preferences and should not
be used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their
dialogs.
## `setting`
whether to keep `self` below other windows
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_mnemonic_modifier -->
Sets the mnemonic modifier for this window.
## `modifier`
the modifier mask used to activate
 mnemonics on this window.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_mnemonics_visible -->
Sets the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets a window modal or non-modal. Modal windows prevent interaction
with other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogs
on top of main application windows, use
`WindowExt::set_transient_for` to make the dialog transient for the
parent; most [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
will then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
## `modal`
whether the window is modal
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_opacity -->
Request the windowing system to make `self` partially transparent,
with opacity 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque. (Values
of the opacity parameter are clamped to the [0,1] range.) On X11
this has any effect only on X screens with a compositing manager
running. See `WidgetExt::is_composited`. On Windows it should work
always.

Note that setting a window’s opacity after the window has been
shown causes it to flicker once on Windows.

# Deprecated since 3.8

Use gtk_widget_set_opacity instead.
## `opacity`
desired opacity, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_position -->
Sets a position constraint for this window. If the old or new
constraint is `WindowPosition::CenterAlways`, this will also cause
the window to be repositioned to satisfy the new constraint.
## `position`
a position constraint.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_resizable -->
Sets whether the user can resize a window. Windows are user resizable
by default.
## `resizable`
`true` if the user can resize this window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_role -->
This function is only useful on X11, not with other GTK+ targets.

In combination with the window title, the window role allows a
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch] to identify "the
same" window when an application is restarted. So for example you
might set the “toolbox” role on your app’s toolbox window, so that
when the user restarts their session, the window manager can put
the toolbox back in the same place.

If a window already has a unique title, you don’t need to set the
role, since the WM can use the title to identify the window when
restoring the session.
## `role`
unique identifier for the window to be used when restoring a session
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_screen -->
Sets the `gdk::Screen` where the `self` is displayed; if
the window is already mapped, it will be unmapped, and
then remapped on the new screen.
## `screen`
a `gdk::Screen`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_skip_pager_hint -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to display
the window in the pager. This function sets this hint.
(A "pager" is any desktop navigation tool such as a workspace
switcher that displays a thumbnail representation of the windows
on the screen.)
## `setting`
`true` to keep this window from appearing in the pager
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_skip_taskbar_hint -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to display
the window in the task bar. This function sets this hint.
## `setting`
`true` to keep this window from appearing in the task bar
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_startup_id -->
Startup notification identifiers are used by desktop environment to
track application startup, to provide user feedback and other
features. This function changes the corresponding property on the
underlying `gdk::Window`. Normally, startup identifier is managed
automatically and you should only use this function in special cases
like transferring focus from other processes. You should use this
function before calling `WindowExt::present` or any equivalent
function generating a window map event.

This function is only useful on X11, not with other GTK+ targets.
## `startup_id`
a string with startup-notification identifier
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `Window`. The title of a window will be
displayed in its title bar; on the X Window System, the title bar
is rendered by the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch],
so exactly how the title appears to users may vary
according to a user’s exact configuration. The title should help a
user distinguish this window from other windows they may have
open. A good title might include the application name and current
document filename, for example.
## `title`
title of the window
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_titlebar -->
Sets a custom titlebar for `self`.

If you set a custom titlebar, GTK+ will do its best to convince
the window manager not to put its own titlebar on the window.
Depending on the system, this function may not work for a window
that is already visible, so you set the titlebar before calling
`WidgetExt::show`.

Feature: `v3_10`

## `titlebar`
the widget to use as titlebar
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_transient_for -->
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` and other convenience
functions in GTK+ will sometimes call
`WindowExt::set_transient_for` on your behalf.

Passing `None` for `parent` unsets the current transient window.

On Windows, this function puts the child window on top of the parent,
much as the window manager would have done on X.
## `parent`
parent window, or `None`
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_type_hint -->
By setting the type hint for the window, you allow the window
manager to decorate and handle the window in a way which is
suitable to the function of the window in your application.

This function should be called before the window becomes visible.

`Dialog::new_with_buttons` and other convenience functions in GTK+
will sometimes call `WindowExt::set_type_hint` on your behalf.
## `hint`
the window type
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_urgency_hint -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment to draw
the users attention to the window. This function sets this hint.
## `setting`
`true` to mark this window as urgent
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn set_wmclass -->
Don’t use this function. It sets the X Window System “class” and
“name” hints for a window. According to the ICCCM, you should
always set these to the same value for all windows in an
application, and GTK+ sets them to that value by default, so calling
this function is sort of pointless. However, you may want to call
`WindowExt::set_role` on each window in your application, for the
benefit of the session manager. Setting the role allows the window
manager to restore window positions when loading a saved session.
## `wmclass_name`
window name hint
## `wmclass_class`
window class hint
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn stick -->
Asks to stick `self`, which means that it will appear on all user
desktops. Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely
stuck afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch] could unstick it
again, and some window managers do not support sticking
windows. But normally the window will end up stuck. Just don't
write code that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window.

You can track stickiness via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn unfullscreen -->
Asks to toggle off the fullscreen state for `self`. Note that you
shouldn’t assume the window is definitely not full screen
afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could fullscreen it
again, and not all window managers honor requests to unfullscreen
windows. But normally the window will end up restored to its normal
state. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track the fullscreen state via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn unmaximize -->
Asks to unmaximize `self`. Note that you shouldn’t assume the
window is definitely unmaximized afterward, because other entities
(e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch])
could maximize it again, and not all window
managers honor requests to unmaximize. But normally the window will
end up unmaximized. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track maximization via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- trait WindowExt::fn unstick -->
Asks to unstick `self`, which means that it will appear on only
one of the user’s desktops. Note that you shouldn’t assume the
window is definitely unstuck afterward, because other entities
(e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could
stick it again. But normally the window will
end up stuck. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track stickiness via the “window-state-event” signal
on `Widget`.
<!-- struct WindowGroup -->
A `WindowGroup` restricts the effect of grabs to windows
in the same group, thereby making window groups almost behave
like separate applications.

A window can be a member in at most one window group at a time.
Windows that have not been explicitly assigned to a group are
implicitly treated like windows of the default window group.

`WindowGroup` objects are referenced by each window in the group,
so once you have added all windows to a `WindowGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the window group with `gobject::Object::unref`. If the
windows in the window group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the window group and drop their references on the window
group; when all window have been removed, the window group will be
freed.

# Implements

[`ObjectExt`](trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn new -->
Creates a new `WindowGroup` object. Grabs added with
`WidgetExt::grab_add` only affect windows within the same `WindowGroup`.

# Returns

a new `WindowGroup`.
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn add_window -->
Adds a window to a `WindowGroup`.
## `window`
the `Window` to add
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn get_current_device_grab -->
Returns the current grab widget for `device`, or `None` if none.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`

# Returns

The grab widget, or `None`
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn get_current_grab -->
Gets the current grab widget of the given group,
see `WidgetExt::grab_add`.

# Returns

the current grab widget of the group
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn list_windows -->
Returns a list of the ``GtkWindows`` that belong to `self`.

# Returns

A
 newly-allocated list of windows inside the group.
<!-- impl WindowGroup::fn remove_window -->
Removes a window from a `WindowGroup`.
## `window`
the `Window` to remove
<!-- enum WindowPosition -->
Window placement can be influenced using this enumeration. Note that
using `WindowPosition::CenterAlways` is almost always a bad idea.
It won’t necessarily work well with all window managers or on all windowing systems.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant None -->
No influence is made on placement.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant Center -->
Windows should be placed in the center of the screen.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant Mouse -->
Windows should be placed at the current mouse position.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant CenterAlways -->
Keep window centered as it changes size, etc.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant CenterOnParent -->
Center the window on its transient
 parent (see `WindowExt::set_transient_for`).
<!-- enum WindowType -->
A `Window` can be one of these types. Most things you’d consider a
“window” should have type `WindowType::Toplevel`; windows with this type
are managed by the window manager and have a frame by default (call
`WindowExt::set_decorated` to toggle the frame). Windows with type
`WindowType::Popup` are ignored by the window manager; window manager
keybindings won’t work on them, the window manager won’t decorate the
window with a frame, many GTK+ features that rely on the window
manager will not work (e.g. resize grips and
maximization/minimization). `WindowType::Popup` is used to implement
widgets such as `Menu` or tooltips that you normally don’t think of
as windows per se. Nearly all windows should be `WindowType::Toplevel`.
In particular, do not use `WindowType::Popup` just to turn off
the window borders; use `WindowExt::set_decorated` for that.
<!-- enum WindowType::variant Toplevel -->
A regular window, such as a dialog.
<!-- enum WindowType::variant Popup -->
A special window such as a tooltip.
<!-- enum WrapMode -->
Describes a type of line wrapping.
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant None -->
do not wrap lines; just make the text area wider
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant Char -->
wrap text, breaking lines anywhere the cursor can
 appear (between characters, usually - if you want to be technical,
 between graphemes, see `pango_get_log_attrs`)
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant Word -->
wrap text, breaking lines in between words
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant WordChar -->
wrap text, breaking lines in between words, or if
 that is not enough, also between graphemes
