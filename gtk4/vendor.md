<!-- struct AboutDialog -->
The `AboutDialog` offers a simple way to display information about
a program like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is
also possible to give credits to the authors, documenters, translators
and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically
opened when the user selects the `About` option from the `Help` menu.
All parts of the dialog are optional.

About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. `AboutDialog`
displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls `gtk_show_uri_on_window`
when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
`AboutDialog::activate-link` signal.

To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
"Edgar Allan Poe <edgar\@poe.com>". To specify a website with a title,
use a string like "GTK+ team http://www.gtk.org".

To make constructing a `AboutDialog` as convenient as possible, you can
use the function `gtk_show_about_dialog` which constructs and shows a dialog
and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.

Note that GTK+ sets a default title of `_("About %s")` on the dialog
window (where \%s is replaced by the name of the application, but in
order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
set the title property explicitly when constructing a `AboutDialog`,
as shown in the following example:

```C
GdkTexture *example_logo = gdk_texture_new_from_file ("./logo.png", NULL);
gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                       "program-name", "ExampleCode",
                       "logo", example_logo,
                       "title", _("About ExampleCode"),
                       NULL);
```

It is also possible to show a `AboutDialog` like any other `Dialog`,
e.g. using `Dialog::run`. In this case, you might need to know that
the “Close” button returns the `ResponseType::Cancel` response id.

## `system_information`
system information or `None`
<!-- trait AboutDialogExt::fn set_translator_credits -->
Sets the translator credits string which is displayed in
the translators tab of the secondary credits dialog.

The intended use for this string is to display the translator
of the language which is currently used in the user interface.
Using `gettext`, a simple way to achieve that is to mark the
string for translation:

```C
GtkWidget *about = gtk_about_dialog_new ();
 gtk_about_dialog_set_translator_credits (GTK_ABOUT_DIALOG (about),
                                          _("translator-credits"));
```
It is a good idea to use the customary msgid “translator-credits” for this
purpose, since translators will already know the purpose of that msgid, and
since `AboutDialog` will detect if “translator-credits” is untranslated
and hide the tab.
## `translator_credits`
the translator credits

<!-- struct AccelGroup -->
A `AccelGroup` represents a group of keyboard accelerators,
typically attached to a toplevel `Window` (with
`GtkWindowExt::add_accel_group`).

Note that “accelerators” are different from
“mnemonics”. Accelerators are shortcuts for
activating a menu item; they appear alongside the menu item they’re a
shortcut for. For example “Ctrl+Q” might appear alongside the “Quit”
menu item. Mnemonics are shortcuts for GUI elements such as text
entries or buttons; they appear as underlined characters. See
`Label::new_with_mnemonic`. Menu items can have both accelerators
and mnemonics, of course.

# Implements

[`AccelGroup`](struct.AccelGroup.html)
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn new -->
Creates a new `AccelGroup`.

# Returns

a new `AccelGroup` object
<!-- impl AccelGroup::fn from_accel_closure -->
Finds the `AccelGroup` to which `closure` is connected;
see `AccelGroupExt::connect`.
## `closure`
a `gobject::Closure`

# Returns

the `AccelGroup` to which `closure`
 is connected, or `None`
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn activate -->
Finds the first accelerator in `self` that matches
`accel_key` and `accel_mods`, and activates it.
## `accel_quark`
the quark for the accelerator name
## `acceleratable`
the `gobject::Object`, usually a `Window`, on which
 to activate the accelerator
## `accel_key`
accelerator keyval from a key event
## `accel_mods`
keyboard state mask from a key event

# Returns

`true` if an accelerator was activated and handled
 this keypress
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn connect -->
Installs an accelerator in this group. When `self` is being
activated in response to a call to `gtk_accel_groups_activate`,
`closure` will be invoked if the `accel_key` and `accel_mods` from
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` match those of this connection.

The signature used for the `closure` is that of ``GtkAccelGroupActivate``.

Note that, due to implementation details, a single closure can
only be connected to one accelerator group.
## `accel_key`
key value of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier combination of the accelerator
## `accel_flags`
a flag mask to configure this accelerator
## `closure`
closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn connect_by_path -->
Installs an accelerator in this group, using an accelerator path
to look up the appropriate key and modifiers (see
`AccelMap::add_entry`). When `self` is being activated
in response to a call to `gtk_accel_groups_activate`, `closure` will
be invoked if the `accel_key` and `accel_mods` from
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` match the key and modifiers for the path.

The signature used for the `closure` is that of ``GtkAccelGroupActivate``.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore,
if you pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it
first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
path used for determining key and modifiers
## `closure`
closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn disconnect -->
Removes an accelerator previously installed through
`AccelGroupExt::connect`.

<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn disconnect_key -->
Removes an accelerator previously installed through
`AccelGroupExt::connect`.
## `accel_key`

modifier combination of the accelerator

# Returns

`true` if there was an accelerator which could be
 removed, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn find -->
Finds the first entry in an accelerator group for which
`find_func` returns `true` and returns its `AccelKey`.
## `find_func`
a function to filter the entries
 of `self` with
## `data`
data to pass to `find_func`

# Returns

the key of the first entry passing
 `find_func`. The key is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn get_is_locked -->
Locks are added and removed using `AccelGroupExt::lock` and
`AccelGroupExt::unlock`.

# Returns

`true` if there are 1 or more locks on the `self`,
 `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn get_modifier_mask -->
Gets a `gdk::ModifierType` representing the mask for this
`self`. For example, `gdk::ModifierType::ControlMask`, `gdk::ModifierType::ShiftMask`, etc.

# Returns

the modifier mask for this accel group.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn lock -->
Locks the given accelerator group.

Locking an acelerator group prevents the accelerators contained
within it to be changed during runtime. Refer to
`AccelMap::change_entry` about runtime accelerator changes.

If called more than once, `self` remains locked until
`AccelGroupExt::unlock` has been called an equivalent number
of times.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn query -->
Queries an accelerator group for all entries matching `accel_key`
and `accel_mods`.
## `accel_key`
key value of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier combination of the accelerator
## `n_entries`
location to return the number
 of entries found, or `None`

# Returns

an array of
 `n_entries` `AccelGroupEntry` elements, or `None`. The array
 is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn unlock -->
Undoes the last call to `AccelGroupExt::lock` on this `self`.
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn connect_accel_activate -->
The accel-activate signal is an implementation detail of
`AccelGroup` and not meant to be used by applications.
## `acceleratable`
the object on which the accelerator was activated
## `keyval`
the accelerator keyval
## `modifier`
the modifier combination of the accelerator

# Returns

`true` if the accelerator was activated
<!-- trait AccelGroupExt::fn connect_accel_changed -->
The accel-changed signal is emitted when an entry
is added to or removed from the accel group.

Widgets like `AccelLabel` which display an associated
accelerator should connect to this signal, and rebuild
their visual representation if the `accel_closure` is theirs.
## `keyval`
the accelerator keyval
## `modifier`
the modifier combination of the accelerator
## `accel_closure`
the `gobject::Closure` of the accelerator
<!-- struct AccelKey -->
<!-- struct AccelLabel -->
The `AccelLabel` is a widget that shows an accelerator next to a description
of said accelerator, e.g. “Save Document Ctrl+S”.
It is commonly used in menus to show the keyboard short-cuts for commands.

The accelerator key to display is typically not set explicitly (although it
can be, with `AccelLabelExt::set_accel`). Instead, the `AccelLabel` displays
the accelerators which have been added to a particular widget. This widget is
set by calling `AccelLabelExt::set_accel_widget`.

For example, a `MenuItem` widget may have an accelerator added to emit
the “activate” signal when the “Ctrl+S” key combination is pressed.
A `AccelLabel` is created and added to the `MenuItem`, and
`AccelLabelExt::set_accel_widget` is called with the `MenuItem` as the
second argument. The `AccelLabel` will now display “Ctrl+S” after its label.

Note that creating a `MenuItem` with `MenuItem::new_with_label` (or
one of the similar functions for `CheckMenuItem` and `RadioMenuItem`)
automatically adds a `AccelLabel` to the `MenuItem` and calls
`AccelLabelExt::set_accel_widget` to set it up for you.

A `AccelLabel` will only display accelerators which have `AccelFlags::Visible`
set (see `AccelFlags`).
A `AccelLabel` can display multiple accelerators and even signal names,
though it is almost always used to display just one accelerator key.

## Creating a simple menu item with an accelerator key.


```C
  GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  GtkWidget *menu = gtk_menu_new ();
  GtkWidget *save_item;
  GtkAccelGroup *accel_group;

  // Create a GtkAccelGroup and add it to the window.
  accel_group = gtk_accel_group_new ();
  gtk_window_add_accel_group (GTK_WINDOW (window), accel_group);

  // Create the menu item using the convenience function.
  save_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Save");
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (menu), save_item);

  // Now add the accelerator to the GtkMenuItem. Note that since we
  // called gtk_menu_item_new_with_label() to create the GtkMenuItem
  // the GtkAccelLabel is automatically set up to display the
  // GtkMenuItem accelerators. We just need to make sure we use
  // GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE here.
  gtk_widget_add_accelerator (save_item, "activate", accel_group,
                              GDK_KEY_s, GDK_CONTROL_MASK, GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE);
```

# CSS nodes


```plain
accellabel
╰── box
    ├── label
    ╰── accelerator
```

`AccelLabel` has a main CSS node with the name accellabel.
It adds a subnode with name box, containing two child nodes with
name label and accelerator.

# Returns

whether the accel label uses mnemonic underlines
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn refetch -->
Recreates the string representing the accelerator keys.
This should not be needed since the string is automatically updated whenever
accelerators are added or removed from the associated widget.

# Returns

always returns `false`.
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn set_accel -->
Manually sets a keyval and modifier mask as the accelerator rendered
by `self`.

If a keyval and modifier are explicitly set then these values are
used regardless of any associated accel closure or widget.

Providing an `accelerator_key` of 0 removes the manual setting.
## `accelerator_key`
a keyval, or 0
## `accelerator_mods`
the modifier mask for the accel
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn set_accel_closure -->
Sets the closure to be monitored by this accelerator label. The closure
must be connected to an accelerator group; see `AccelGroupExt::connect`.
Passing `None` for `accel_closure` will dissociate `self` from its
current closure, if any.
## `accel_closure`
the closure to monitor for accelerator changes,
or `None`
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn set_accel_widget -->
Sets the widget to be monitored by this accelerator label. Passing `None` for
`accel_widget` will dissociate `self` from its current widget, if any.
## `accel_widget`
the widget to be monitored, or `None`
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn set_label -->
Sets the label part of the accel label.
## `text`
The new label text
<!-- trait AccelLabelExt::fn set_use_underline -->
Controls whether to interpret underscores in the text label of `self`
as mnemonic indicators. See also `LabelExt::set_use_underline`
## `setting`
Whether to use underlines in the label or not
<!-- struct AccelMap -->
Accelerator maps are used to define runtime configurable accelerators.
Functions for manipulating them are are usually used by higher level
convenience mechanisms and are thus considered
“low-level”. You’ll want to use them if you’re manually creating menus that
should have user-configurable accelerators.

An accelerator is uniquely defined by:
- accelerator path
- accelerator key
- accelerator modifiers

The accelerator path must consist of
“`<WINDOWTYPE>`/Category1/Category2/.../Action”, where WINDOWTYPE
should be a unique application-specific identifier that corresponds
to the kind of window the accelerator is being used in, e.g.
“Gimp-Image”, “Abiword-Document” or “Gnumeric-Settings”.
The “Category1/.../Action” portion is most appropriately chosen by
the action the accelerator triggers, i.e. for accelerators on menu
items, choose the item’s menu path, e.g. “File/Save As”,
“Image/View/Zoom” or “Edit/Select All”. So a full valid accelerator
path may look like: “`<Gimp-Toolbox>`/File/Dialogs/Tool Options...”.

All accelerators are stored inside one global `AccelMap` that can
be obtained using `AccelMap::get`. See
[Monitoring changes][monitoring-changes] for additional
details.

# Manipulating accelerators

New accelerators can be added using `AccelMap::add_entry`.
To search for specific accelerator, use `AccelMap::lookup_entry`.
Modifications of existing accelerators should be done using
`AccelMap::change_entry`.

In order to avoid having some accelerators changed, they can be
locked using `AccelMap::lock_path`. Unlocking is done using
`AccelMap::unlock_path`.

# Saving and loading accelerator maps

Accelerator maps can be saved to and loaded from some external
resource. For simple saving and loading from file,
`AccelMap::save` and `AccelMap::load` are provided.
Saving and loading can also be done by providing file descriptor
to `AccelMap::save_fd` and `AccelMap::load_fd`.

# Monitoring changes

`AccelMap` object is only useful for monitoring changes of
accelerators. By connecting to `AccelMap::changed` signal, one
can monitor changes of all accelerators. It is also possible to
monitor only single accelerator path by using it as a detail of
the `AccelMap::changed` signal.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn add_entry -->
Registers a new accelerator with the global accelerator map.
This function should only be called once per `accel_path`
with the canonical `accel_key` and `accel_mods` for this path.
To change the accelerator during runtime programatically, use
`AccelMap::change_entry`.

Set `accel_key` and `accel_mods` to 0 to request a removal of
the accelerator.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore, if you
pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it first with
`g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
valid accelerator path
## `accel_key`
the accelerator key
## `accel_mods`
the accelerator modifiers
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn add_filter -->
Adds a filter to the global list of accel path filters.

Accel map entries whose accel path matches one of the filters
are skipped by `AccelMap::foreach`.

This function is intended for GTK+ modules that create their own
menus, but don’t want them to be saved into the applications accelerator
map dump.
## `filter_pattern`
a pattern (see `glib::PatternSpec`)
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn change_entry -->
Changes the `accel_key` and `accel_mods` currently associated with `accel_path`.
Due to conflicts with other accelerators, a change may not always be possible,
`replace` indicates whether other accelerators may be deleted to resolve such
conflicts. A change will only occur if all conflicts could be resolved (which
might not be the case if conflicting accelerators are locked). Successful
changes are indicated by a `true` return value.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore, if you
pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it first with
`g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path
## `accel_key`
the new accelerator key
## `accel_mods`
the new accelerator modifiers
## `replace`
`true` if other accelerators may be deleted upon conflicts

# Returns

`true` if the accelerator could be changed, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn foreach -->
Loops over the entries in the accelerator map whose accel path
doesn’t match any of the filters added with `AccelMap::add_filter`,
and execute `foreach_func` on each. The signature of `foreach_func` is
that of ``GtkAccelMapForeach``, the `changed` parameter indicates whether
this accelerator was changed during runtime (thus, would need
saving during an accelerator map dump).
## `data`
data to be passed into `foreach_func`
## `foreach_func`
function to be executed for each accel
 map entry which is not filtered out
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn foreach_unfiltered -->
Loops over all entries in the accelerator map, and execute
`foreach_func` on each. The signature of `foreach_func` is that of
``GtkAccelMapForeach``, the `changed` parameter indicates whether
this accelerator was changed during runtime (thus, would need
saving during an accelerator map dump).
## `data`
data to be passed into `foreach_func`
## `foreach_func`
function to be executed for each accel
 map entry
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn get -->
Gets the singleton global `AccelMap` object. This object
is useful only for notification of changes to the accelerator
map via the ::changed signal; it isn’t a parameter to the
other accelerator map functions.

# Returns

the global `AccelMap` object
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn load -->
Parses a file previously saved with `AccelMap::save` for
accelerator specifications, and propagates them accordingly.
## `file_name`
a file containing accelerator specifications,
 in the GLib file name encoding
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn load_fd -->
Filedescriptor variant of `AccelMap::load`.

Note that the file descriptor will not be closed by this function.
## `fd`
a valid readable file descriptor
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn load_scanner -->
`glib::Scanner` variant of `AccelMap::load`.
## `scanner`
a `glib::Scanner` which has already been provided with an input file
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn lock_path -->
Locks the given accelerator path. If the accelerator map doesn’t yet contain
an entry for `accel_path`, a new one is created.

Locking an accelerator path prevents its accelerator from being changed
during runtime. A locked accelerator path can be unlocked by
`AccelMap::unlock_path`. Refer to `AccelMap::change_entry`
for information about runtime accelerator changes.

If called more than once, `accel_path` remains locked until
`AccelMap::unlock_path` has been called an equivalent number
of times.

Note that locking of individual accelerator paths is independent from
locking the `AccelGroup` containing them. For runtime accelerator
changes to be possible, both the accelerator path and its `AccelGroup`
have to be unlocked.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn lookup_entry -->
Looks up the accelerator entry for `accel_path` and fills in `key`.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path
## `key`
the accelerator key to be filled in (optional)

# Returns

`true` if `accel_path` is known, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn save -->
Saves current accelerator specifications (accelerator path, key
and modifiers) to `file_name`.
The file is written in a format suitable to be read back in by
`AccelMap::load`.
## `file_name`
the name of the file to contain
 accelerator specifications, in the GLib file name encoding
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn save_fd -->
Filedescriptor variant of `AccelMap::save`.

Note that the file descriptor will not be closed by this function.
## `fd`
a valid writable file descriptor
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn unlock_path -->
Undoes the last call to `AccelMap::lock_path` on this `accel_path`.
Refer to `AccelMap::lock_path` for information about accelerator path locking.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path
<!-- impl AccelMap::fn connect_changed -->
Notifies of a change in the global accelerator map.
The path is also used as the detail for the signal,
so it is possible to connect to
changed::`accel_path`.
## `accel_path`
the path of the accelerator that changed
## `accel_key`
the key value for the new accelerator
## `accel_mods`
the modifier mask for the new accelerator
<!-- struct Accessible -->
The `Accessible` class is the base class for accessible
implementations for `Widget` subclasses. It is a thin
wrapper around `atk::Object`, which adds facilities for associating
a widget with its accessible object.

An accessible implementation for a third-party widget should
derive from `Accessible` and implement the suitable interfaces
from ATK, such as `atk::Text` or `atk::Selection`. To establish
the connection between the widget class and its corresponding
acccessible implementation, override the get_accessible vfunc
in `WidgetClass`.

# Implements

[`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`atk::ObjectExt`](../atk/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait AccessibleExt -->
Trait containing all `Accessible` methods.

# Implementors

[`Accessible`](struct.Accessible.html)
<!-- trait AccessibleExt::fn get_widget -->
Gets the `Widget` corresponding to the `Accessible`.
The returned widget does not have a reference added, so
you do not need to unref it.

# Returns

pointer to the `Widget`
 corresponding to the `Accessible`, or `None`.
<!-- trait AccessibleExt::fn set_widget -->
Sets the `Widget` corresponding to the `Accessible`.

`self` will not hold a reference to `widget`.
It is the caller’s responsibility to ensure that when `widget`
is destroyed, the widget is unset by calling this function
again with `widget` set to `None`.
## `widget`
a `Widget` or `None` to unset
<!-- struct ActionBar -->
`ActionBar` is designed to present contextual actions. It is
expected to be displayed below the content and expand horizontally
to fill the area.

It allows placing children at the start or the end. In addition, it
contains an internal centered box which is centered with respect to
the full width of the box, even if the children at either side take
up different amounts of space.

# CSS nodes

`ActionBar` has a single CSS node with name actionbar.

<!-- impl ActionBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `ActionBar` widget.

# Returns

<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn get_center_widget -->
Retrieves the center bar widget of the bar.

# Returns

the center `Widget` or `None`.
<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn get_revealed -->
Gets the value of the `ActionBar:revealed` property.

# Returns

the current value of the `ActionBar:revealed` property.
<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
end of the `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn pack_start -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
start of the `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn set_center_widget -->
Sets the center widget for the `ActionBar`.
## `center_widget`
a widget to use for the center
<!-- trait ActionBarExt::fn set_revealed -->
Sets the `ActionBar:revealed` property to `revealed`. Changing this will
make `self` reveal (`true`) or conceal (`false`) itself via a sliding
transition.

Note: this does not show or hide `self` in the `Widget:visible` sense,
so revealing has no effect if `Widget:visible` is `false`.
## `revealed`
The new value of the property
<!-- struct Actionable -->
This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with
actions on a `ApplicationWindow` or `Application`.

It primarily consists of two properties: `Actionable:action-name`
and `Actionable:action-target`. There are also some convenience APIs
for setting these properties.

The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the `ApplicationWindow`
or `Application`, but other action groups that are added with
`WidgetExt::insert_action_group` will be consulted as well.

<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_name -->
Gets the action name for `self`.

See `Actionable::set_action_name` for more information.

# Returns

the action name, or `None` if none is set
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_target_value -->
Gets the current target value of `self`.

See `Actionable::set_action_target_value` for more information.

# Returns

the current target value
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_name -->
Specifies the name of the action with which this widget should be
associated. If `action_name` is `None` then the widget will be
unassociated from any previous action.

Usually this function is used when the widget is located (or will be
located) within the hierarchy of a `ApplicationWindow`.

Names are of the form “win.save” or “app.quit” for actions on the
containing `ApplicationWindow` or its associated `Application`,
respectively. This is the same form used for actions in the `gio::Menu`
associated with the window.
## `action_name`
an action name, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target -->
Sets the target of an actionable widget.

This is a convenience function that calls `glib::Variant::new` for
`format_string` and uses the result to call
`Actionable::set_action_target_value`.

If you are setting a string-valued target and want to set the action
name at the same time, you can use
gtk_actionable_set_detailed_action_name ().
## `format_string`
a GVariant format string
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target_value -->
Sets the target value of an actionable widget.

If `target_value` is `None` then the target value is unset.

The target value has two purposes. First, it is used as the
parameter to activation of the action associated with the
`Actionable` widget. Second, it is used to determine if the widget
should be rendered as “active” — the widget is active if the state
is equal to the given target.

Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a `gio::Action`
with string state in a typical “radio button” situation. Each button
will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
value for that action. Clicking on a particular button will activate
the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
the action’s state to change to that value. Since the action’s state
is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
rendered inactive).
## `target_value`
a `glib::Variant` to set as the target value, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_detailed_action_name -->
Sets the action-name and associated string target value of an
actionable widget.

`detailed_action_name` is a string in the format accepted by
`gio::Action::parse_detailed_name`.

(Note that prior to version 3.22.25,
this function is only usable for actions with a simple "s" target, and
`detailed_action_name` must be of the form `"action::target"` where
`action` is the action name and `target` is the string to use
as the target.)
## `detailed_action_name`
the detailed action name
<!-- struct Adjustment -->
The `Adjustment` object represents a value which has an associated lower
and upper bound, together with step and page increments, and a page size.
It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including `SpinButton`, `Viewport`,
and `Range` (which is a base class for `Scrollbar` and `Scale`).

The `Adjustment` object does not update the value itself. Instead
it is left up to the owner of the `Adjustment` to control the value.

# Implements

[`AdjustmentExt`](trait.AdjustmentExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt -->
Trait containing all `Adjustment` methods.

# Implementors

[`Adjustment`](struct.Adjustment.html)
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn new -->
Creates a new `Adjustment`.
## `value`
the initial value
## `lower`
the minimum value
## `upper`
the maximum value
## `step_increment`
the step increment
## `page_increment`
the page increment
## `page_size`
the page size

# Returns

a new `Adjustment`
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn clamp_page -->
Updates the `Adjustment:value` property to ensure that the range
between `lower` and `upper` is in the current page (i.e. between
`Adjustment:value` and `Adjustment:value` + `Adjustment:page-size`).
If the range is larger than the page size, then only the start of it will
be in the current page.

A `Adjustment::value-changed` signal will be emitted if the value is changed.
## `lower`
the lower value
## `upper`
the upper value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn configure -->
Sets all properties of the adjustment at once.

Use this function to avoid multiple emissions of the
`Adjustment::changed` signal. See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower`
for an alternative way of compressing multiple emissions of
`Adjustment::changed` into one.
## `value`
the new value
## `lower`
the new minimum value
## `upper`
the new maximum value
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
## `page_size`
the new page size
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_lower -->
Retrieves the minimum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current minimum value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_minimum_increment -->
Gets the smaller of step increment and page increment.

# Returns

the minimum increment of `self`
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_page_increment -->
Retrieves the page increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page increment of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_page_size -->
Retrieves the page size of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page size of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_step_increment -->
Retrieves the step increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current step increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_upper -->
Retrieves the maximum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current maximum value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the adjustment.
See `AdjustmentExt::set_value`.

# Returns

The current value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_lower -->
Sets the minimum value of the adjustment.

When setting multiple adjustment properties via their individual
setters, multiple `Adjustment::changed` signals will be emitted.
However, since the emission of the `Adjustment::changed` signal
is tied to the emission of the `gobject::Object::notify` signals of the changed
properties, it’s possible to compress the `Adjustment::changed`
signals into one by calling `gobject::ObjectExt::freeze_notify` and
`gobject::ObjectExt::thaw_notify` around the calls to the individual setters.

Alternatively, using a single `gobject::ObjectExt::set` for all the properties
to change, or using `AdjustmentExt::configure` has the same effect
of compressing `Adjustment::changed` emissions.
## `lower`
the new minimum value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_page_increment -->
Sets the page increment of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_page_size -->
Sets the page size of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment`::changed signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `page_size`

<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_step_increment -->
Sets the step increment of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_upper -->
Sets the maximum value of the adjustment.

Note that values will be restricted by `upper - page-size`
if the page-size property is nonzero.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `upper`
the new maximum value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the `Adjustment` value. The value is clamped to lie between
`Adjustment:lower` and `Adjustment:upper`.

Note that for adjustments which are used in a `Scrollbar`, the
effective range of allowed values goes from `Adjustment:lower` to
`Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page-size`.
## `value`
the new value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted when one or more of the `Adjustment` properties have been
changed, other than the `Adjustment:value` property.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
Emitted when the `Adjustment:value` property has been changed.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_lower -->
The minimum value of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_lower -->
The minimum value of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_page_increment -->
The page increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_page_increment -->
The page increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_page_size -->
The page size of the adjustment.
Note that the page-size is irrelevant and should be set to zero
if the adjustment is used for a simple scalar value, e.g. in a
`SpinButton`.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_page_size -->
The page size of the adjustment.
Note that the page-size is irrelevant and should be set to zero
if the adjustment is used for a simple scalar value, e.g. in a
`SpinButton`.

The step increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_step_increment -->
The step increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_upper -->

Note that values will be restricted by
`upper - page-size` if the page-size
property is nonzero.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_upper -->
The maximum value of the adjustment.
Note that values will be restricted by
`upper - page-size` if the page-size
property is nonzero.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_value -->
The value of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_value -->
The value of the adjustment.
<!-- enum Align -->
Controls how a widget deals with extra space in a single (x or y)
dimension.

Alignment only matters if the widget receives a “too large” allocation,
for example if you packed the widget with the `Widget:expand`
flag inside a `Box`, then the widget might get extra space. If
you have for example a 16x16 icon inside a 32x32 space, the icon
could be scaled and stretched, it could be centered, or it could be
positioned to one side of the space.

Note that in horizontal context `Align::Start` and `Align::End`
are interpreted relative to text direction.

GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE support for it is optional for containers and widgets, and
it is only supported for vertical alignment. When its not supported by
a child or a container it is treated as `Align::Fill`.
<!-- enum Align::variant Fill -->
stretch to fill all space if possible, center if
 no meaningful way to stretch
<!-- enum Align::variant Start -->
snap to left or top side, leaving space on right
 or bottom
<!-- enum Align::variant End -->
snap to right or bottom side, leaving space on left
 or top
<!-- enum Align::variant Center -->
center natural width of widget inside the
 allocation
<!-- enum Align::variant Baseline -->
align the widget according to the baseline
<!-- struct AppChooser -->
`AppChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by widgets which
allow the user to choose an application (typically for the purpose of
opening a file). The main objects that implement this interface are
`AppChooserWidget`, `AppChooserDialog` and `AppChooserButton`.

Applications are represented by GIO `gio::AppInfo` objects here.
GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
knows the default and last-used application for a given content
type. The `AppChooserWidget` provides detailed control over
whether the shown list of applications should include default,
recommended or fallback applications.

To obtain the application that has been selected in a `AppChooser`,
use `AppChooser::get_app_info`.

for more information about content types.
<!-- trait AppChooserExt::fn set_property_content_type -->
The content type of the `AppChooser` object.

See [GContentType][gio-GContentType]
for more information about content types.
<!-- struct AppChooserButton -->
The `AppChooserButton` is a widget that lets the user select
an application. It implements the `AppChooser` interface.

Initially, a `AppChooserButton` selects the first application
in its list, which will either be the most-recently used application
or, if `AppChooserButton:show-default-item` is `true`, the
default application.

The list of applications shown in a `AppChooserButton` includes
the recommended applications for the given content type. When
`AppChooserButton:show-default-item` is set, the default application
is also included. To let the user chooser other applications,
you can set the `AppChooserButton:show-dialog-item` property,
which allows to open a full `AppChooserDialog`.

It is possible to add custom items to the list, using
`AppChooserButtonExt::append_custom_item`. These items cause
the `AppChooserButton::custom-item-activated` signal to be
emitted when they are selected.

To track changes in the selected application, use the
``GtkAppChooserbutton`::changed` signal.

`AppChooserWidget` is a widget for selecting applications.
It is the main building block for `AppChooserDialog`. Most
applications only need to use the latter; but you can use
this widget as part of a larger widget if you have special needs.

`AppChooserWidget` offers detailed control over what applications
are shown, using the
`AppChooserWidget:show-default`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-recommended`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-fallback`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-other` and
`AppChooserWidget:show-all`
properties. See the `AppChooser` documentation for more information
about these groups of applications.

To keep track of the selected application, use the
`AppChooserWidget::application-selected` and `AppChooserWidget::application-activated` signals.

<!-- struct Application -->
`Application` is a class that handles many important aspects
of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
a one-size-fits-all application model.

Currently, `Application` handles GTK+ initialization, application
uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
life-cycle of your application.

While `Application` works fine with plain ``GtkWindows``, it is recommended
to use it together with `ApplicationWindow`.

When GDK threads are enabled, `Application` will acquire the GDK
lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes. The GDK
lock is not touched for local action invocations. In order to have
actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
`gio::ActionGroup::activate_action`. The same applies to actions
associated with `ApplicationWindow` and to the “activate” and
“open” `gio::Application` methods.

## Automatic resources ## {`automatic`-resources}

`Application` will automatically load menus from the `Builder`
resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
resource base path (see `gio::ApplicationExt::set_resource_base_path`). The
menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
and accessed via `GtkApplicationExt::get_menu_by_id` which allows for
dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.

If the resources "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the value
of `GtkApplicationExt::prefers_app_menu`. If the resource "gtk/menus-common.ui"
is present it will be loaded as well. This is useful for storing items that
are referenced from both "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" and
"gtk/menus-traditional.ui".

It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
`GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` and `GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

`Application` will also automatically setup an icon search path for
the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
resources. See `IconThemeExt::add_resource_path` for more
information.

If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
defines a `ShortcutsWindow` with ID "help_overlay" then `Application`
associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
`ApplicationWindow` and sets up keyboard accelerators (Control-F1
and Control-?) to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.

## A simple application ## {`gtkapplication`}

[A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)

`Application` optionally registers with a session manager
of the users session (if you set the `Application:register-session`
property) and offers various functionality related to the session
life-cycle.

An application can block various ways to end the session with
the `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit` function. Typical use cases for
this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
session while inhibitors are present.

<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt -->
Trait containing all `Application` methods.

# Implementors

[`Application`](struct.Application.html)
<!-- impl Application::fn new -->
Creates a new `Application` instance.

When using `Application`, it is not necessary to call `gtk_init`
manually. It is called as soon as the application gets registered as
the primary instance.

Concretely, `gtk_init` is called in the default handler for the
`gio::Application::startup` signal. Therefore, `Application` subclasses should
chain up in their `gio::Application::startup` handler before using any GTK+ API.

Note that commandline arguments are not passed to `gtk_init`.
All GTK+ functionality that is available via commandline arguments
can also be achieved by setting suitable environment variables
such as `G_DEBUG`, so this should not be a big
problem. If you absolutely must support GTK+ commandline arguments,
you can explicitly call `gtk_init` before creating the application
instance.

If non-`None`, the application ID must be valid. See
`gio::Application::id_is_valid`.

If no application ID is given then some features (most notably application
uniqueness) will be disabled. A null application ID is only allowed with
GTK+ 3.6 or later.
## `application_id`
The application ID.
## `flags`
the application flags

# Returns

a new `Application` instance
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn add_window -->
Adds a window to `self`.

This call can only happen after the `self` has started;
typically, you should add new application windows in response
to the emission of the `gio::Application::activate` signal.

This call is equivalent to setting the `Window:application`
property of `window` to `self`.

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it with `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window`.

GTK+ will keep the `self` running as long as it has
any windows.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_accels_for_action -->
Gets the accelerators that are currently associated with
the given action.
## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to obtain accelerators for

# Returns

accelerators for `detailed_action_name`, as
 a `None`-terminated array. Free with `g_strfreev` when no longer needed
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_actions_for_accel -->
Returns the list of actions (possibly empty) that `accel` maps to.
Each item in the list is a detailed action name in the usual form.

This might be useful to discover if an accel already exists in
order to prevent installation of a conflicting accelerator (from
an accelerator editor or a plugin system, for example). Note that
having more than one action per accelerator may not be a bad thing
and might make sense in cases where the actions never appear in the
same context.

In case there are no actions for a given accelerator, an empty array
is returned. `None` is never returned.

It is a programmer error to pass an invalid accelerator string.
If you are unsure, check it with `gtk_accelerator_parse` first.
## `accel`
an accelerator that can be parsed by `gtk_accelerator_parse`

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of actions for `accel`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_active_window -->
Gets the “active” window for the application.

The active window is the one that was most recently focused (within
the application). This window may not have the focus at the moment
if another application has it — this is just the most
recently-focused window within this application.

# Returns

the active window, or `None` if
 there isn't one.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_app_menu -->
Returns the menu model that has been set with
`GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu`.

# Returns

the application menu of `self`
 or `None` if no application menu has been set.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_menu_by_id -->
Gets a menu from automatically loaded resources.
See [Automatic resources][automatic-resources]
for more information.
## `id`
the id of the menu to look up

# Returns

Gets the menu with the
 given id from the automatically loaded resources
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_menubar -->
Returns the menu model that has been set with
`GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

# Returns

the menubar for windows of `self`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_window_by_id -->
Returns the `ApplicationWindow` with the given ID.

The ID of a `ApplicationWindow` can be retrieved with
`ApplicationWindowExt::get_id`.
## `id`
an identifier number

# Returns

the window with ID `id`, or
 `None` if there is no window with this ID
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_windows -->
Gets a list of the ``GtkWindows`` associated with `self`.

The list is sorted by most recently focused window, such that the first
element is the currently focused window. (Useful for choosing a parent
for a transient window.)

The list that is returned should not be modified in any way. It will
only remain valid until the next focus change or window creation or
deletion.

# Returns

a `glib::List` of `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn inhibit -->
Inform the session manager that certain types of actions should be
inhibited. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and for
all types of actions.

Applications should invoke this method when they begin an operation
that should not be interrupted, such as creating a CD or DVD. The
types of actions that may be blocked are specified by the `flags`
parameter. When the application completes the operation it should
call `GtkApplicationExt::uninhibit` to remove the inhibitor. Note that
an application can have multiple inhibitors, and all of them must
be individually removed. Inhibitors are also cleared when the
application exits.

Applications should not expect that they will always be able to block
the action. In most cases, users will be given the option to force
the action to take place.

Reasons should be short and to the point.

If `window` is given, the session manager may point the user to
this window to find out more about why the action is inhibited.
## `window`
a `Window`, or `None`
## `flags`
what types of actions should be inhibited
## `reason`
a short, human-readable string that explains
 why these operations are inhibited

# Returns

A non-zero cookie that is used to uniquely identify this
 request. It should be used as an argument to `GtkApplicationExt::uninhibit`
 in order to remove the request. If the platform does not support
 inhibiting or the request failed for some reason, 0 is returned.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn list_action_descriptions -->
Lists the detailed action names which have associated accelerators.
See `GtkApplicationExt::set_accels_for_action`.

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of strings,
 free with `g_strfreev` when done
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn prefers_app_menu -->
Determines if the desktop environment in which the application is
running would prefer an application menu be shown.

If this function returns `true` then the application should call
`GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` with the contents of an application
menu, which will be shown by the desktop environment. If it returns
`false` then you should consider using an alternate approach, such as
a menubar.

The value returned by this function is purely advisory and you are
free to ignore it. If you call `GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` even
if the desktop environment doesn't support app menus, then a fallback
will be provided.

Applications are similarly free not to set an app menu even if the
desktop environment wants to show one. In that case, a fallback will
also be created by the desktop environment (GNOME, for example, uses
a menu with only a "Quit" item in it).

The value returned by this function never changes. Once it returns a
particular value, it is guaranteed to always return the same value.

You may only call this function after the application has been
registered and after the base startup handler has run. You're most
likely to want to use this from your own startup handler. It may
also make sense to consult this function while constructing UI (in
activate, open or an action activation handler) in order to determine
if you should show a gear menu or not.

This function will return `false` on Mac OS and a default app menu
will be created automatically with the "usual" contents of that menu
typical to most Mac OS applications. If you call
`GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` anyway, then this menu will be
replaced with your own.

# Returns

`true` if you should set an app menu
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn remove_window -->
Remove a window from `self`.

If `window` belongs to `self` then this call is equivalent to
setting the `Window:application` property of `window` to
`None`.

The application may stop running as a result of a call to this
function.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_accels_for_action -->
Sets zero or more keyboard accelerators that will trigger the
given action. The first item in `accels` will be the primary
accelerator, which may be displayed in the UI.

To remove all accelerators for an action, use an empty, zero-terminated
array for `accels`.

For the `detailed_action_name`, see `gio::Action::parse_detailed_name` and
`gio::Action::print_detailed_name`.
## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to associate accelerators with
## `accels`
a list of accelerators in the format
 understood by `gtk_accelerator_parse`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_app_menu -->
Sets or unsets the application menu for `self`.

This can only be done in the primary instance of the application,
after it has been registered. `gio::Application::startup` is a good place
to call this.

The application menu is a single menu containing items that typically
impact the application as a whole, rather than acting on a specific
window or document. For example, you would expect to see
“Preferences” or “Quit” in an application menu, but not “Save” or
“Print”.

If supported, the application menu will be rendered by the desktop
environment.

Use the base `gio::ActionMap` interface to add actions, to respond to the user
selecting these menu items.
## `app_menu`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_menubar -->
Sets or unsets the menubar for windows of `self`.

This is a menubar in the traditional sense.

This can only be done in the primary instance of the application,
after it has been registered. `gio::Application::startup` is a good place
to call this.

Depending on the desktop environment, this may appear at the top of
each window, or at the top of the screen. In some environments, if
both the application menu and the menubar are set, the application
menu will be presented as if it were the first item of the menubar.
Other environments treat the two as completely separate — for example,
the application menu may be rendered by the desktop shell while the
menubar (if set) remains in each individual window.

Use the base `gio::ActionMap` interface to add actions, to respond to the
user selecting these menu items.
## `menubar`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn uninhibit -->
Removes an inhibitor that has been established with `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit`.
Inhibitors are also cleared when the application exits.
## `cookie`
a cookie that was returned by `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_query_end -->
Emitted when the session manager is about to end the session, only
if `Application::register-session` is `true`. Applications can
connect to this signal and call `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit` with
`ApplicationInhibitFlags::Logout` to delay the end of the session
until state has been saved.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_window_added -->
Emitted when a `Window` is added to `application` through
`GtkApplicationExt::add_window`.
## `window`
the newly-added `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_window_removed -->
Emitted when a `Window` is removed from `application`,
either as a side-effect of being destroyed or explicitly
through `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window`.
## `window`
the `Window` that is being removed
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_property_register_session -->
Set this property to `true` to register with the session manager.
This will make GTK+ track the session state (such as the
`Application::screensaver-active` property).
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_property_register_session -->
Set this property to `true` to register with the session manager.
This will make GTK+ track the session state (such as the
`Application::screensaver-active` property).
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_property_screensaver_active -->
This property is `true` if GTK+ believes that the screensaver is
currently active. GTK+ only tracks session state (including this)
when `Application::register-session` is set to `true`.

Tracking the screensaver state is supported on Linux.
<!-- struct ApplicationWindow -->
`ApplicationWindow` is a `Window` subclass that offers some
extra functionality for better integration with `Application`
features. Notably, it can handle both the application menu as well
as the menubar. See `GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` and
`GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

This class implements the `gio::ActionGroup` and `gio::ActionMap` interfaces,
to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
associated `Application`, together with its application-wide
actions. Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
referring to them from a `gio::MenuModel`.

Note that widgets that are placed inside a `ApplicationWindow`
can also activate these actions, if they implement the
`Actionable` interface.

As with `Application`, the GDK lock will be acquired when
processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore
be held when activating actions locally (if GDK threads are enabled).

The settings `Settings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu` and
`Settings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar` tell GTK+ whether the
desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
on Windows neither will be. gnome-shell (starting with version 3.4)
will display the application menu, but not the menubar.

If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
`ApplicationWindow` will automatically show a `MenuBar` for it.
This behaviour can be overridden with the `ApplicationWindow:show-menubar`
property. If the desktop environment does not display the application
menu, then it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the
windows client-side decorations.

## A `ApplicationWindow` with a menubar


```C
GtkApplication *app = gtk_application_new ("org.gtk.test", 0);

GtkBuilder *builder = gtk_builder_new_from_string (
    "<interface>"
    "  <menu id='menubar'>"
    "    <submenu label='_Edit'>"
    "      <item label='_Copy' action='win.copy'/>"
    "      <item label='_Paste' action='win.paste'/>"
    "    </submenu>"
    "  </menu>"
    "</interface>",
    -1);

GMenuModel *menubar = G_MENU_MODEL (gtk_builder_get_object (builder,
                                                           "menubar"));
gtk_application_set_menubar (GTK_APPLICATION (app), menubar);
g_object_unref (builder);

// ...

GtkWidget *window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
```

## Handling fallback yourself

[A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/examples/sunny.c)

The XML format understood by `Builder` for `gio::MenuModel` consists
of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
same content model as `<menu>`. Instead of `<link name="submenu>` or
`<link name="section">`, you can use `<submenu>` or `<section>`
elements.

Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other `Builder`
content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
`translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
To make use of this, the `Builder` must have been given the gettext
domain to use.

The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:
- "label": a user-visible string to display
- "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
- "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
- "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
- "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to determine
 if a submenu can be opened
- "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
 Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".

The following attributes are used when constructing sections:
- "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
- "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
 Possible values include "horizontal-buttons".
- "text-direction": a string used to determine the `TextDirection` to use
 when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
 include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".

The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:
- "label": a user-visible string to display
- "icon": icon name to display

<!-- struct AspectFrame -->
The `AspectFrame` is useful when you want
pack a widget so that it can resize but always retains
the same aspect ratio. For instance, one might be
drawing a small preview of a larger image. `AspectFrame`
derives from `Frame`, so it can draw a label and
a frame around the child. The frame will be
“shrink-wrapped” to the size of the child.

# CSS nodes

`AspectFrame` uses a CSS node with name frame.

 ratio is taken from the requistion of the child.
<!-- struct Assistant -->
A `Assistant` is a widget used to represent a generally complex
operation splitted in several steps, guiding the user through its
pages and controlling the page flow to collect the necessary data.

The design of `Assistant` is that it controls what buttons to show
and to make sensitive, based on what it knows about the page sequence
and the [type][`AssistantPageType`] of each page,
in addition to state information like the page
[completion][gtk-assistant-set-page-complete]
and [committed][gtk-assistant-commit] status.

If you have a case that doesn’t quite fit in ``GtkAssistants`` way of
handling buttons, you can use the `AssistantPageType::Custom` page
type and handle buttons yourself.

`Assistant` maintains a `AssistantPage` object for each added
child, which holds additional per-child properties. You
obtain the `AssistantPage` for a child with `AssistantExt::get_page`.

# `Assistant` as `Buildable`

The `Assistant` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
exposes the `action_area` as internal children with the name
“action_area”.

To add pages to an assistant in `Builder`, simply add it as a
child to the `Assistant` object. If you need to set per-object
properties, create a `AssistantPage` object explicitly, and
set the child widget as a property on it.

# CSS nodes

`Assistant` has a single CSS node with the name assistant.

Erases the visited page history so the back button is not
shown on the current page, and removes the cancel button
from subsequent pages.

Use this when the information provided up to the current
page is hereafter deemed permanent and cannot be modified
or undone. For example, showing a progress page to track
a long-running, unreversible operation after the user has
clicked apply on a confirmation page.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn get_current_page -->
Returns the page number of the current page.

 or -1 to append the page to the `self`

# Returns

the index (starting from 0) of the inserted page
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn next_page -->
Navigate to the next page.

It is a programming error to call this function when
there is no next page.

This function is for use when creating pages of the
`AssistantPageType::Custom` type.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn prepend_page -->
Prepends a page to the `self`.
## `page`
a `Widget`

# Returns

the index (starting at 0) of the inserted page
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn previous_page -->

## `page_num`
the index of a page in the `self`,
 or -1 to remove the last page
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn set_current_page -->
Switches the page to `page_num`.

Note that this will only be necessary in custom buttons,
as the `self` flow can be set with
`AssistantExt::set_forward_page_func`.
## `page_num`
index of the page to switch to, starting from 0.
 If negative, the last page will be used. If greater
 than the number of pages in the `self`, nothing
 will be done.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn set_forward_page_func -->
Sets the page forwarding function to be `page_func`.

This function will be used to determine what will be
the next page when the user presses the forward button.
Setting `page_func` to `None` will make the assistant to
use the default forward function, which just goes to the
next visible page.
## `page_func`
the ``GtkAssistantPageFunc``, or `None`
 to use the default one
## `data`
user data for `page_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn set_page_complete -->

<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn update_buttons_state -->
Forces `self` to recompute the buttons state.

GTK+ automatically takes care of this in most situations,
e.g. when the user goes to a different page, or when the
visibility or completeness of a page changes.

One situation where it can be necessary to call this
function is when changing a value on the current page
affects the future page flow of the assistant.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn connect_apply -->
The ::apply signal is emitted when the apply button is clicked.

The default behavior of the `Assistant` is to switch to the page
after the current page, unless the current page is the last one.

A handler for the ::apply signal should carry out the actions for
which the wizard has collected data. If the action takes a long time
to complete, you might consider putting a page of type
`AssistantPageType::Progress` after the confirmation page and handle
this operation within the `Assistant::prepare` signal of the progress
page.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn connect_cancel -->
The ::cancel signal is emitted when then the cancel button is clicked.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is emitted either when the close button of
a summary page is clicked, or when the apply button in the last
page in the flow (of type `AssistantPageType::Confirm`) is clicked.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn connect_prepare -->
The ::prepare signal is emitted when a new page is set as the
assistant's current page, before making the new page visible.

A handler for this signal can do any preparations which are
necessary before showing `page`.
## `page`
the current page
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn get_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the assistant uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- trait AssistantExt::fn set_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the assistant uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- struct AssistantPage -->

<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn get_property_complete -->
Setting the "complete" property to `true` marks a page as
complete (i.e.: all the required fields are filled out). GTK+ uses
this information to control the sensitivity of the navigation buttons.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn set_property_complete -->
Setting the "complete" property to `true` marks a page as
complete (i.e.: all the required fields are filled out). GTK+ uses
this information to control the sensitivity of the navigation buttons.

The type of the assistant page.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn get_property_title -->
The title of the page.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn set_property_title -->
The title of the page.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType -->
An enum for determining the page role inside the `Assistant`. It's
used to handle buttons sensitivity and visibility.

Note that an assistant needs to end its page flow with a page of type
`AssistantPageType::Confirm`, `AssistantPageType::Summary` or
`AssistantPageType::Progress` to be correct.

The Cancel button will only be shown if the page isn’t “committed”.
See `AssistantExt::commit` for details.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Content -->
The page has regular contents. Both the
 Back and forward buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Intro -->
The page contains an introduction to the
 assistant task. Only the Forward button will be shown if there is a
 next page.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Confirm -->
The page lets the user confirm or deny the
 changes. The Back and Apply buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Summary -->
The page informs the user of the changes
 done. Only the Close button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Progress -->
Used for tasks that take a long time to
 complete, blocks the assistant until the page is marked as complete.
 Only the back button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Custom -->
Used for when other page types are not
 appropriate. No buttons will be shown, and the application must
 add its own buttons through `AssistantExt::add_action_widget`.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition -->
Whenever a container has some form of natural row it may align
children in that row along a common typographical baseline. If
the amount of verical space in the row is taller than the total
requested height of the baseline-aligned children then it can use a
`BaselinePosition` to select where to put the baseline inside the
extra availible space.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Top -->
Align the baseline at the top
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Center -->
Center the baseline
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Bottom -->
Align the baseline at the bottom
<!-- struct Bin -->
The `Bin` widget is a container with just one child.
It is not very useful itself, but it is useful for deriving subclasses,
since it provides common code needed for handling a single child widget.

Many GTK+ widgets are subclasses of `Bin`, including `Window`,
`Button`, `Frame` or `ScrolledWindow`.

<!-- trait BinExt::fn get_child -->
Gets the child of the `Bin`, or `None` if the bin contains
no child widget. The returned widget does not have a reference
added, so you do not need to unref it.

# Returns

the child of `self`, or `None` if it does
not have a child.
<!-- struct BinLayout -->
`BinLayout` is a `LayoutManager` subclass useful for create "bins" of
widgets. `BinLayout` will stack each child of a widget on top of each
other, using the `Widget:hexpand`, `Widget:vexpand`, `Widget:halign`,
and `Widget:valign` properties of each child to determine where they
should be positioned.

<!-- struct Box -->
The `Box` widget arranges child widgets into a single row or column,
depending upon the value of its `Orientable:orientation` property. Within
the other dimension, all children are allocated the same size. Of course,
the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties can be used on
the children to influence their allocation.

Use repeated calls to `ContainerExt::add` to pack widgets into a
`Box` from start to end. Use `ContainerExt::remove` to remove widgets
from the `Box`. `BoxExt::insert_child_after` can be used to add a child
at a particular position.

Use `BoxExt::set_homogeneous` to specify whether or not all children
of the `Box` are forced to get the same amount of space.

Use `BoxExt::set_spacing` to determine how much space will be
minimally placed between all children in the `Box`. Note that
spacing is added between the children.

Use `BoxExt::reorder_child_after` to move a child to a different
place in the box.

# CSS nodes

`Box` uses a single CSS node with name box.

<!-- struct BoxLayout -->
A `BoxLayout` is a layout manager that arranges the children of any
widget using it into a single row or column, depending on the value
of its `Orientable:orientation` property. Within the other dimension
all children all allocated the same size. The `BoxLayout` will respect
the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties of each child
widget.

If you want all children to be assigned the same size, you can use
the `BoxLayout:homogeneous` property.

If you want to specify the amount of space placed between each child,
you can use the `BoxLayout:spacing` property.

<!-- struct Buildable -->
`Buildable` allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization
from [`Builder` UI descriptions][BUILDER-UI].
The interface includes methods for setting names and properties of objects,
parsing custom tags and constructing child objects.

The `Buildable` interface is implemented by all widgets and
many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK+. The
main user of this interface is `Builder`. There should be
very little need for applications to call any of these functions directly.

An object only needs to implement this interface if it needs to extend the
`Builder` format or run any extra routines at deserialization time.

<!-- struct Builder -->
A `Builder` is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
a `Builder` from a user interface description, call
`Builder::new_from_file`, `Builder::new_from_resource` or
`Builder::new_from_string`.

In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
descriptions from multiple sources to the same `Builder` you can
call `Builder::new` to get an empty builder and populate it by
(multiple) calls to `Builder::add_from_file`,
`BuilderExt::add_from_resource` or `BuilderExt::add_from_string`.

A `Builder` holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call `WidgetExt::destroy`
to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.

The functions `Builder::get_object` and `BuilderExt::get_objects`
can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
with `WidgetExt::destroy`. Other widgets will either be part of a
larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
Non-widget objects need to be reffed with `gobject::ObjectExt::ref` to keep them
beyond the lifespan of the builder.

The function `BuilderExt::connect_signals` and variants thereof can be
used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.

# `Builder` UI Definitions # {`BUILDER`-UI}

`Builder` parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “`Builder`
UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.

[RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)

The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
using `dgettext` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
calling `BuilderExt::set_translation_domain` on the builder.
Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
`<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A `<child>`
element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. The builder will error
out if the version requirements are not met.

Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type` function from the
class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type` function
explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, `Builder`
allows to use an object that has been constructed by a ``GtkUIManager`` in
another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the ``GtkUIManager``
in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
attribute.

Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
application to retrieve them from the builder with `Builder::get_object`.
An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
with ___ (3 underscores) for its own purposes.

Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
`<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
`gettext` (or `dgettext` if the builder has a translation domain set)
to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
may help the translators.

`Builder` can parse textual representations for the most common
property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
as `true`, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
as `false`), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
and colors (in a format understood by `gdk::RGBA::parse`).

GVariants can be specified in the format understood by `glib::Variant::parse`,
and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.

Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
`BuilderExt::expose_object`. In general, `Builder` allows forward
references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
be used as the value of a construct-only property.

It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
property value using the attributes
"bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
"bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
"bind-flags" to specify the binding flags
Internally builder implement this using GBinding objects.
For more information see `gobject::ObjectExt::bind_property`

Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
to find the handler using `gmodule::Module::symbol`, but this can be changed by
passing a custom ``GtkBuilderConnectFunc`` to
`Builder::connect_signals_full`. The remaining attributes, “after”,
“swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
parameters of the `g_signal_connect_object` or
`g_signal_connect_data` functions. A “last_modification_time”
attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
builder.

Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the `vbox` of
a `Dialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
propery of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that `Builder`
still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
has already been constructed.

A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
(e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

# A `Builder` UI Definition


```text
<interface>
  <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
    <child internal-child="vbox">
      <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1">
        <child internal-child="action_area">
          <object class="GtkBox" id="hbuttonbox1">
            <child>
              <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                <property name="label">gtk-ok</property>
                <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
```

Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their
own XML DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD
above. Note that a custom element in a `<child>` element gets parsed by
the custom tag handler of the parent object, while a custom element in
an `<object>` element gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.

These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the
respective objects.

Additionally, since 3.10 a special `<template>` tag has been added
to the format allowing one to define a widget class’s components.
See the [`Widget` documentation][composite-templates] for details.

# Implements

[`BuilderExt`](trait.BuilderExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuilderExtManual`](prelude/trait.BuilderExtManual.html)
<!-- trait BuilderExt -->
Trait containing all `Builder` methods.

# Implementors

[`Builder`](struct.Builder.html)
<!-- impl Builder::fn new -->
Creates a new empty builder object.

This function is only useful if you intend to make multiple calls
to `Builder::add_from_file`, `BuilderExt::add_from_resource`
or `BuilderExt::add_from_string` in order to merge multiple UI
descriptions into a single builder.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`,
`Builder::new_from_resource` or `Builder::new_from_string`.

# Returns

a new (empty) `Builder` object
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_file -->
Builds the [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
in the file `filename`.

If there is an error opening the file or parsing the description then
the program will be aborted. You should only ever attempt to parse
user interface descriptions that are shipped as part of your program.
## `filename`
filename of user interface description file

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_resource -->
Builds the [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
at `resource_path`.

If there is an error locating the resource or parsing the
description, then the program will be aborted.
## `resource_path`
a `gio::Resource` resource path

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_string -->
Builds the user interface described by `string` (in the
[`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI] format).

If `string` is `None`-terminated, then `length` should be -1.
If `length` is not -1, then it is the length of `string`.

If there is an error parsing `string` then the program will be
aborted. You should not attempt to parse user interface description
from untrusted sources.
## `string`
a user interface (XML) description
## `length`
the length of `string`, or -1

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the interface described by `string`
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn add_callback_symbol -->
Adds the `callback_symbol` to the scope of `self` under the given `callback_name`.

Using this function overrides the behavior of `BuilderExt::connect_signals`
for any callback symbols that are added. Using this method allows for better
encapsulation as it does not require that callback symbols be declared in
the global namespace.
## `callback_name`
The name of the callback, as expected in the XML
## `callback_symbol`
The callback pointer
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn add_callback_symbols -->
A convenience function to add many callbacks instead of calling
`BuilderExt::add_callback_symbol` for each symbol.
## `first_callback_name`
The name of the callback, as expected in the XML
## `first_callback_symbol`
The callback pointer
<!-- trait BuilderExtManual::fn add_from_file -->
Parses a file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. You should not use this function with untrusted files (ie:
files that are not part of your application). Broken `Builder`
files can easily crash your program, and it’s possible that memory
was leaked leading up to the reported failure. The only reasonable
thing to do when an error is detected is to call `g_error`.
## `filename`
the name of the file to parse

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn add_from_resource -->
Parses a resource file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_resource`.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_RESOURCE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error`.
## `resource_path`
the path of the resource file to parse

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn add_from_string -->
Parses a string containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_string`.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or
`G_VARIANT_PARSE_ERROR` domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error`.
## `buffer`
the string to parse
## `length`

<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn connect_signals -->
This method is a simpler variation of `Builder::connect_signals_full`.
It uses symbols explicitly added to `self` with prior calls to
`BuilderExt::add_callback_symbol`. In the case that symbols are not
explicitly added; it uses `gmodule::Module`’s introspective features (by opening the module `None`)
to look at the application’s symbol table. From here it tries to match
the signal handler names given in the interface description with
symbols in the application and connects the signals. Note that this
function can only be called once, subsequent calls will do nothing.

Note that unless `BuilderExt::add_callback_symbol` is called for
all signal callbacks which are referenced by the loaded XML, this
function will require that `gmodule::Module` be supported on the platform.

If you rely on `gmodule::Module` support to lookup callbacks in the symbol table,
the following details should be noted:

When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
with `G_MODULE_EXPORT`, or they will not be put in the symbol table.
On Linux and Unices, this is not necessary; applications should instead
be compiled with the -Wl,--export-dynamic CFLAGS, and linked against
gmodule-export-2.0.
## `user_data`
user data to pass back with all signals
<!-- trait BuilderExtManual::fn connect_signals_full -->
This function can be thought of the interpreted language binding
version of `BuilderExt::connect_signals`, except that it does not
require GModule to function correctly.
## `func`
the function used to connect the signals
## `user_data`
arbitrary data that will be passed to the connection function
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn expose_object -->
Add `object` to the `self` object pool so it can be referenced just like any
other object built by builder.
## `name`
the name of the object exposed to the builder
## `object`
the object to expose
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn extend_with_template -->
Main private entry point for building composite container
components from template XML.

This is exported purely to let gtk-builder-tool validate
templates, applications have no need to call this function.
## `widget`
the widget that is being extended
## `template_type`
the type that the template is for
## `buffer`
the string to parse
## `length`
the length of `buffer` (may be -1 if `buffer` is nul-terminated)

# Returns

A positive value on success, 0 if an error occurred
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn get_application -->
Gets the `Application` associated with the builder.

The `Application` is used for creating action proxies as requested
from XML that the builder is loading.

By default, the builder uses the default application: the one from
`gio::Application::get_default`. If you want to use another application
for constructing proxies, use `BuilderExt::set_application`.

# Returns

the application being used by the builder,
 or `None`
<!-- trait BuilderExtManual::fn get_object -->
Gets the object named `name`. Note that this function does not
increment the reference count of the returned object.
## `name`
name of object to get

# Returns

the object named `name` or `None` if
 it could not be found in the object tree.
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn get_objects -->
Gets all objects that have been constructed by `self`. Note that
this function does not increment the reference counts of the returned
objects.

# Returns

a newly-allocated `glib::SList` containing all the objects
 constructed by the `Builder` instance. It should be freed by
 `glib::SList::free`
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn get_translation_domain -->
Gets the translation domain of `self`.

# Returns

 in case it was never set or explicitly unset via `BuilderExt::set_translation_domain`.
 This string is owned by the builder object and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn get_type_from_name -->
Looks up a type by name, using the virtual function that
`Builder` has for that purpose. This is mainly used when
implementing the `Buildable` interface on a type.
## `type_name`
type name to lookup

# Returns

the `glib::Type` found for `type_name` or `G_TYPE_INVALID`
 if no type was found
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn lookup_callback_symbol -->
Fetches a symbol previously added to `self`
with `BuilderExt::add_callback_symbols`

This function is intended for possible use in language bindings
or for any case that one might be cusomizing signal connections
using `Builder::connect_signals_full`
## `callback_name`
The name of the callback

# Returns

The callback symbol in `self` for `callback_name`, or `None`

initialised beforehand.

This function can handle char, uchar, boolean, int, uint, long,
ulong, enum, flags, float, double, string, `gdk::RGBA` and
`Adjustment` type values. Support for `Widget` type values is
still to come.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.
## `pspec`
the `gobject::ParamSpec` for the property
## `string`
the string representation of the value
## `value`
the `gobject::Value` to store the result in

# Returns

`true` on success
<!-- trait BuilderExt::fn value_from_string_type -->
Like `BuilderExt::value_from_string`, this function demarshals
a value from a string, but takes a `glib::Type` instead of `gobject::ParamSpec`.
This function calls `gobject::Value::init` on the `value` argument, so it
need not be initialised beforehand.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.
## `type_`

<!-- struct Button -->
The `Button` widget is generally used to trigger a callback function that is
called when the button is pressed. The various signals and how to use them
are outlined below.

The `Button` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it can hold
almost any other standard `Widget`. The most commonly used child is the
`Label`.

# CSS nodes

`Button` has a single CSS node with name button. The node will get the
style classes .image-button or .text-button, if the content is just an
image or label, respectively. It may also receive the .flat style class.

Other style classes that are commonly used with `Button` include
.suggested-action and .destructive-action. In special cases, buttons
can be made round by adding the .circular style class.

Button-like widgets like `ToggleButton`, `MenuButton`, `VolumeButton`,
`LockButton`, `ColorButton`, `FontButton` or `FileChooserButton` use
style classes such as .toggle, .popup, .scale, .lock, .color, .file
to differentiate themselves from a plain `Button`.

<!-- struct Calendar -->
`Calendar` is a widget that displays a Gregorian calendar, one month
at a time. It can be created with `Calendar::new`.

The month and year currently displayed can be altered with
`CalendarExt::select_month`. The exact day can be selected from the
displayed month using `CalendarExt::select_day`.

To place a visual marker on a particular day, use `CalendarExt::mark_day`
and to remove the marker, `CalendarExt::unmark_day`. Alternative, all
marks can be cleared with `CalendarExt::clear_marks`.

The way in which the calendar itself is displayed can be altered using
`CalendarExt::set_display_options`.

The selected date can be retrieved from a `Calendar` using
`CalendarExt::get_date`.

Users should be aware that, although the Gregorian calendar is the
legal calendar in most countries, it was adopted progressively
between 1582 and 1929. Display before these dates is likely to be
historically incorrect.

<!-- struct CellArea -->
The `CellArea` is an abstract class for `CellLayout` widgets
(also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with an
arbitrary number of ``GtkCellRenderers`` and interact with the user
for a given `TreeModel` row.

The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
size requests and allocations for a given row of data.

Usually users dont have to interact with the `CellArea` directly
unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.

# Requesting area sizes

As outlined in
[`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management],
GTK+ uses a height-for-width
geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
interfaces. `CellArea` uses the same semantics to calculate the
size of an area for an arbitrary number of `TreeModel` rows.

When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
different layouting widgets. For instance a `TreeViewColumn`
always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a `IconView`
on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
areas when allocated less width.

It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
cells are different in each row). For this reason the `CellArea`
uses a `CellAreaContext` object to store the alignments
and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
with the said context).

The `CellAreaContext` is an opaque object specific to the
`CellArea` which created it (see `CellAreaExt::create_context`).
The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
However, it’s important that the same `CellAreaContext` which
was used to request the sizes for a given `TreeModel` row be
used when rendering or processing events for that row.

In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
gint        minimum_width;
gint        natural_width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
```

Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
in the accompanying `CellAreaContext` object and can be consulted
at any time.

This can be useful since `CellLayout` widgets usually have to
support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
exceedingly large amount of rows. The `CellLayout` widget in
that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
idle or timeout source (see `g_timeout_add`) and when the widget
is requested its actual width in `WidgetClass.get_preferred_width`()
it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
`CellAreaContext` object.

A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:


```C
static void
foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget       *widget,
                         gint            *minimum_size,
                         gint            *natural_size)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;

  foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (foo);

  gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
}
```

In the above example the Foo widget has to make sure that some
row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that Foo judged
was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
the `CellAreaContext`.

Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
a similar task except in this case the `CellAreaContext` does not
store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
width which was requested by the `CellArea`).

In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
root level of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
gint        minimum_height;
gint        natural_height;
gint        full_minimum_height = 0;
gint        full_natural_height = 0;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
                                                  width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);

    if (width_is_for_allocation)
       cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);

    full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
    full_natural_height += natural_height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
allocation.

In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
who need to request size for tens of thousands of rows. For this
case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
call to `WidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width`(). Returning
a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
values while more and more height is required for the row heights
that are calculated in the background.

# Rendering Areas

Once area sizes have been aquired at least for the rows in the
visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
`WidgetClass.draw`() time.

A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
runs as follows:


```C
GtkAllocation allocation;
GdkRectangle  cell_area = { 0, };
GtkTreeIter   iter;
gint          minimum_width;
gint          natural_width;

gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
cell_area.width = allocation.width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);

    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
                          &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);

    cell_area.y += cell_area.height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
`Widget::size-allocate` time using `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation`.

# Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus

Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
normal widget and then passing them to the `CellAreaExt::event`
API as they come in. Usually `CellArea` is only interested in
button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
trigger the `CellArea::focus-changed` signal to fire; as well as
`CellArea::add-editable` in the case that an editable cell was
clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
`CellAreaExt::stop_editing` at any time to cancel any cell editing
that is currently in progress.

The `CellArea` drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
similar to `Widget`. For layouting widgets that support giving
focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass `CellRendererState::Focused`
to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
area to paint the focus at render time.

Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
`WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method. The layouting widget is always
responsible for knowing where `TreeModel` rows are rendered inside
the widget, so at `WidgetClass.focus`() time the layouting widget
should use the `CellArea` methods to navigate focus inside the area
and then observe the `DirectionType` to pass the focus to adjacent
rows and areas.

A basic example of how the `WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method
should be implemented:


```C
static gboolean
foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
           GtkDirectionType direction)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
  gint        focus_row;
  gboolean    have_focus = FALSE;

  focus_row = priv->focus_row;

  if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
    gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);

  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
  while (valid)
    {
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);

      if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
        {
           priv->focus_row = focus_row;
           have_focus = TRUE;
           break;
        }
      else
        {
          if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
              direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
            break;
          else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
                   direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
           {
              if (focus_row == 0)
                break;
              else
               {
                  focus_row--;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
               }
            }
          else
            {
              if (focus_row == last_row)
                break;
              else
                {
                  focus_row++;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return have_focus;
}
```

Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
`DirectionType` values to the way it lays out its cells.

# Cell Properties

The `CellArea` introduces cell properties for ``GtkCellRenderers``
in very much the same way that `Container` introduces
[child properties][child-properties]
for ``GtkWidgets``. This provides some general interfaces for defining
the relationship cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a
`CellAreaBox` a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when
the area is allocated more than its full natural request, or a cell
might be configured to “align” with adjacent rows which were requested
and rendered with the same `CellAreaContext`.

Use `CellAreaClass::install_cell_property` to install cell
properties for a cell area class and `CellAreaClass::find_cell_property`
or `CellAreaClass::list_cell_properties` to get information about
existing cell properties.

To set the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_set_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_set` or `CellAreaExt::cell_set_valist`. To obtain
the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_get_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_get` or `CellAreaExt::cell_get_valist`.

Implementing `CellArea` classes should implement this
method to receive and navigate focus in its own way particular
to how it lays out cells.

on each cell area individually to get the height for width of each
fully requested row.

If at some point, the width of a single row changes, it should be
requested with `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` again and then

Indicates that focus changed on this `area`. This signal
is emitted either as a result of focus handling or event

<!-- struct CellAreaBox -->
The `CellAreaBox` renders cell renderers into a row or a column
depending on its `Orientation`.

`CellAreaBox` uses a notion of packing. Packing
refers to adding cell renderers with reference to a particular position
in a `CellAreaBox`. There are two reference positions: the
start and the end of the box.
When the `CellAreaBox` is oriented in the `Orientation::Vertical`
orientation, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
defined as the bottom. In the `Orientation::Horizontal` orientation
start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right
side.

Alignments of ``GtkCellRenderers`` rendered in adjacent rows can be
configured by configuring the `CellAreaBox` align child cell property
with `CellArea::cell_set_property` or by specifying the "align"
argument to `CellAreaBoxExt::pack_start` and `CellAreaBoxExt::pack_end`.

<!-- struct CellAreaContext -->
The `CellAreaContext` object is created by a given `CellArea`
implementation via its `CellAreaClass.create_context`() virtual
method and is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
`TreeModel` rows that are requested and rendered in the same context.

`CellLayout` widgets can create any number of contexts in which to
request and render groups of data rows. However, it’s important that the
same context which was used to request sizes for a given `TreeModel`
row also be used for the same row when calling other `CellArea` APIs
such as `gtk_cell_area_render` and `CellAreaExt::event`.

<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt -->

# Implementors

[`CellAreaContext`](struct.CellAreaContext.html)
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn allocate -->
Allocates a width and/or a height for all rows which are to be
rendered with `self`.

Usually allocation is performed only horizontally or sometimes
vertically since a group of rows are usually rendered side by
side vertically or horizontally and share either the same width
or the same height. Sometimes they are allocated in both horizontal
and vertical orientations producing a homogeneous effect of the
rows. This is generally the case for `TreeView` when
`TreeView:fixed-height-mode` is enabled.
## `width`
the allocated width for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
## `height`
the allocated height for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_allocation -->
Fetches the current allocation size for `self`.

If the context was not allocated in width or height, or if the
context was recently reset with `CellAreaContextExt::reset`,
the returned value will be -1.
## `width`
location to store the allocated width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the allocated height, or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_area -->
Fetches the `CellArea` this `self` was created by.

This is generally unneeded by layouting widgets; however,
it is important for the context implementation itself to
fetch information about the area it is being used for.

For instance at `CellAreaContextClass.allocate`() time
it’s important to know details about any cell spacing
that the `CellArea` is configured with in order to
compute a proper allocation.

# Returns

the `CellArea` this context was created by.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for all rows which have been
requested with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are 0.
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height,
 or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_height_for_width -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for `width` for all rows
which have been requested for the same said `width` with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `width`
a proposed width for allocation
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height,
 or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_width -->
Gets the accumulative preferred width for all rows which have been
requested with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are 0.
## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width,
 or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_width_for_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred width for `height` for all rows which
have been requested for the same said `height` with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `height`
a proposed height for allocation
## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width,
 or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn push_preferred_height -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural height to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural height.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested height over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height` requests.
## `minimum_height`
the proposed new minimum height for `self`
## `natural_height`
the proposed new natural height for `self`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn push_preferred_width -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural width to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural width.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested width over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` requests.
## `minimum_width`
the proposed new minimum width for `self`
## `natural_width`
the proposed new natural width for `self`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn reset -->
Resets any previously cached request and allocation
data.

When underlying `TreeModel` data changes its
important to reset the context if the content
size is allowed to shrink. If the content size
is only allowed to grow (this is usually an option
for views rendering large data stores as a measure
of optimization), then only the row that changed
or was inserted needs to be (re)requested with
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`.

When the new overall size of the context requires
that the allocated size changes (or whenever this
allocation changes at all), the variable row
sizes need to be re-requested for every row.

For instance, if the rows are displayed all with
the same width from top to bottom then a change
in the allocated width necessitates a recalculation
of all the displayed row heights using
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height_for_width`.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_area -->
The `CellArea` this context was created by
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn set_property_area -->
The `CellArea` this context was created by
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_minimum_height -->

<!-- struct CellEditable -->
The `CellEditable` interface must be implemented for widgets to be usable

Emits the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn remove_widget -->
Emits the `CellEditable::remove-widget` signal.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn start_editing -->
Begins editing on a `self`.

The `CellRenderer` for the cell creates and returns a `CellEditable` from
`CellRendererExt::start_editing`, configured for the `CellRenderer` type.

`CellEditable::start_editing` can then set up `self` suitably for
editing a cell, e.g. making the Esc key emit `CellEditable::editing-done`.

Note that the `self` is created on-demand for the current edit; its
lifetime is temporary and does not persist across other edits and/or cells.
## `event`
The `gdk::Event` that began the editing process, or
 `None` if editing was initiated programmatically
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn connect_editing_done -->
This signal is a sign for the cell renderer to update its
value from the `cell_editable`.

Implementations of `CellEditable` are responsible for
emitting this signal when they are done editing, e.g.
`Entry` emits this signal when the user presses Enter. Typical things to
do in a handler for ::editing-done are to capture the edited value,
disconnect the `cell_editable` from signals on the `CellRenderer`, etc.

`CellEditable::editing_done` is a convenience method
for emitting `CellEditable::editing-done`.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn connect_remove_widget -->
This signal is meant to indicate that the cell is finished
editing, and the `cell_editable` widget is being removed and may
subsequently be destroyed.

Implementations of `CellEditable` are responsible for
emitting this signal when they are done editing. It must
be emitted after the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal,
to give the cell renderer a chance to update the cell's value
before the widget is removed.

`CellEditable::remove_widget` is a convenience method
for emitting `CellEditable::remove-widget`.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn get_property_editing_canceled -->
Indicates whether editing on the cell has been canceled.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn set_property_editing_canceled -->
Indicates whether editing on the cell has been canceled.
<!-- struct CellLayout -->
`CellLayout` is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
want to provide a `TreeViewColumn` like API for packing cells,
setting attributes and data funcs.

One of the notable features provided by implementations of
`CellLayout` are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
tree model with `CellLayout::set_attributes`, which means that the value
of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
`CellLayout::set_cell_data_func` that is called to determine the
value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.

# `GtkCellLayouts` as `Buildable`

Implementations of `CellLayout` which also implement the `Buildable`
interface (`CellView`, `IconView`, `ComboBox`,
`EntryCompletion`, `TreeViewColumn`) accept `CellRenderer` objects
as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
attribute value.

This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:

```C
combo = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
```

to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
are only initialized after instance `init`
functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
the existence of the cell area in your subclass’ `init` function will
cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
you to the problem).


```C
static void
my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
{
  GtkCellRenderer *cell;

  cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();
  // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
  // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
  gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
  ...
}

GtkWidget *
my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
{
  // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
  return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
}
```

If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
problematic calls out of `init` and into a `constructor`
for your class.

<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`.

The `column` is the column of the model to get a value from, and the
`attribute` is the parameter on `cell` to be set from the value. So for
example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from column 2.

<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn get_cells -->
Returns the cell renderers which have been added to `self`.

# Returns


 a list of cell renderers. The list, but not the renderers has
 been newly allocated and should be freed with `glib::List::free`
 when no longer needed.
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to the end of `self`. If `expand` is `false`, then the
`cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is
divided evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of `self`. If `expand` is `false`,

is divided evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.
## `cell`

## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn reorder -->
Re-inserts `cell` at `position`.

Note that `cell` has already to be packed into `self`
for this to function properly.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` to reorder
## `position`
new position to insert `cell` at
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn set_attributes -->

removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn set_cell_data_func -->
Sets the ``GtkCellLayoutDataFunc`` to use for `self`.

This function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping
for setting the column value, and should set the value of `self`’s
cell renderer(s) as appropriate.

`func` may be `None` to remove a previously set function.
## `cell`

## `func`
the ``GtkCellLayoutDataFunc`` to use, or `None`
## `func_data`
user data for `func`
## `destroy`

<!-- struct CellRenderer -->
The `CellRenderer` is a base class of a set of objects used for
rendering a cell to a `cairo::Context`. These objects are used primarily by
the `TreeView` widget, though they aren’t tied to them in any
specific way. It is worth noting that `CellRenderer` is not a
`Widget` and cannot be treated as such.

The primary use of a `CellRenderer` is for drawing a certain graphical
elements on a `cairo::Context`. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
draw many cells on the screen. To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
CellRenderer keep any permanent state around. Instead, any state is set
just prior to use using `GObjects` property system. Then, the
cell is measured using `CellRendererExt::get_preferred_size`. Finally, the cell
is rendered in the correct location using `CellRendererExt::snapshot`.

There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
`CellRenderer`. First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
barring a ``GtkStyle`` change. The `CellRenderer` also has a number of
generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.

Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
“activatable” like `CellRendererToggle`,
which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
“editable” like `CellRendererText`, which
allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
`CellEditable` interface, e.g. `Entry`.
To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
implement the `CellRendererClass.activate` or
`CellRendererClass.start_editing` virtual functions, respectively.

Many properties of `CellRenderer` and its subclasses have a
corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_fixed_size -->
Sets the renderer size to be explicit, independent of the properties set.
## `width`
the width of the cell renderer, or -1
## `height`
the height of the cell renderer, or -1
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_padding -->
Sets the renderer’s padding.

<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_sensitive -->
Sets the cell renderer’s sensitivity.
## `sensitive`

<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the cell renderer’s visibility.
## `visible`
the visibility of the cell
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn snapshot -->
Invokes the virtual render function of the `CellRenderer`. The three
passed-in rectangles are areas in `cr`. Most renderers will draw within
`cell_area`; the xalign, yalign, xpad, and ypad fields of the `CellRenderer`
should be honored with respect to `cell_area`. `background_area` includes the
blank space around the cell, and also the area containing the tree expander;
so the `background_area` rectangles for all cells tile to cover the entire
`window`.
## `snapshot`
a `Snapshot` to draw to
## `widget`
the widget owning `window`
## `background_area`
entire cell area (including tree expanders and maybe
 padding on the sides)
## `cell_area`
area normally rendered by a cell renderer
## `flags`
flags that affect rendering
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn start_editing -->
Starts editing the contents of this `self`, through a new `CellEditable`
widget created by the `CellRendererClass.start_editing` virtual function.
## `event`
a `gdk::Event`
## `widget`
widget that received the event
## `path`
widget-dependent string representation of the event location;
 e.g. for `TreeView`, a string representation of `TreePath`
## `background_area`
background area as passed to `gtk_cell_renderer_render`
## `cell_area`
cell area as passed to `gtk_cell_renderer_render`
## `flags`
render flags

# Returns

A new `CellEditable` for editing this
 `self`, or `None` if editing is not possible
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn stop_editing -->
Informs the cell renderer that the editing is stopped.
If `canceled` is `true`, the cell renderer will emit the
`CellRenderer::editing-canceled` signal.

This function should be called by cell renderer implementations
in response to the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal of
`CellEditable`.
## `canceled`
`true` if the editing has been canceled
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn connect_editing_canceled -->
This signal gets emitted when the user cancels the process of editing a
cell. For example, an editable cell renderer could be written to cancel
editing when the user presses Escape.

See also: `CellRendererExt::stop_editing`.
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn connect_editing_started -->
This signal gets emitted when a cell starts to be edited.
The intended use of this signal is to do special setup
on `editable`, e.g. adding a `EntryCompletion` or setting
up additional columns in a `ComboBox`.

See `CellEditable::start_editing` for information on the lifecycle of
the `editable` and a way to do setup that doesn’t depend on the `renderer`.

Note that GTK+ doesn't guarantee that cell renderers will
continue to use the same kind of widget for editing in future
releases, therefore you should check the type of `editable`
before doing any specific setup, as in the following example:

```C
static void
text_editing_started (GtkCellRenderer *cell,
                      GtkCellEditable *editable,
                      const gchar     *path,
                      gpointer         data)
{
  if (GTK_IS_ENTRY (editable))
    {
      GtkEntry *entry = GTK_ENTRY (editable);
      
      // ... create a GtkEntryCompletion
      
      gtk_entry_set_completion (entry, completion);
    }
}
```
## `editable`
the `CellEditable`
## `path`
the path identifying the edited cell
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn get_property_cell_background_rgba -->
Cell background as a `gdk::RGBA`
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_property_cell_background_rgba -->
Cell background as a `gdk::RGBA`
<!-- struct CellRendererAccel -->
`CellRendererAccel` displays a keyboard accelerator (i.e. a key
combination like `Control + a`). If the cell renderer is editable,
the accelerator can be changed by simply typing the new combination.

The `CellRendererAccel` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- struct CellRendererCombo -->
`CellRendererCombo` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererCombo` offers a `ComboBox`
widget to edit the text. The values to display in the combo box are taken from
the tree model specified in the `CellRendererCombo:model` property.

The combo cell renderer takes care of adding a text cell renderer to the combo
box and sets it to display the column specified by its
`CellRendererCombo:text-column` property. Further properties of the combo box
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

The `CellRendererCombo` cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.6.

<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt -->
Trait containing all `CellRendererCombo` methods.

# Implementors

[`CellRendererCombo`](struct.CellRendererCombo.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererCombo`.
Adjust how text is drawn using object properties.
Object properties can be set globally (with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`).
Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you can bind a property to a value
in a `TreeModel`. For example, you can bind the “text” property
on the cell renderer to a string value in the model, thus rendering
a different string in each row of the `TreeView`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn connect_changed -->
This signal is emitted each time after the user selected an item in
the combo box, either by using the mouse or the arrow keys. Contrary
to `ComboBox`, `CellRendererCombo`::changed is not emitted for
changes made to a selected item in the entry. The argument `new_iter`
corresponds to the newly selected item in the combo box and it is relative
to the `TreeModel` set via the model property on `CellRendererCombo`.

Note that as soon as you change the model displayed in the tree view,
the tree view will immediately cease the editing operating. This
means that you most probably want to refrain from changing the model
until the combo cell renderer emits the edited or editing_canceled signal.
## `path_string`
a string of the path identifying the edited cell
 (relative to the tree view model)
## `new_iter`
the new iter selected in the combo box
 (relative to the combo box model)
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn get_property_has_entry -->

values other than the ones in the popup list.
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn set_property_has_entry -->
If `true`, the cell renderer will include an entry and allow to enter
values other than the ones in the popup list.
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn get_property_model -->
Holds a tree model containing the possible values for the combo box.
Use the text_column property to specify the column holding the values.
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn set_property_model -->
Holds a tree model containing the possible values for the combo box.
Use the text_column property to specify the column holding the values.
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn get_property_text_column -->
Specifies the model column which holds the possible values for the
combo box.

Note that this refers to the model specified in the model property,
not the model backing the tree view to which
this cell renderer is attached.

`CellRendererCombo` automatically adds a text cell renderer for
this column to its combo box.
<!-- trait CellRendererComboExt::fn set_property_text_column -->
Specifies the model column which holds the possible values for the
combo box.

Note that this refers to the model specified in the model property,

`CellRendererCombo` automatically adds a text cell renderer for
this column to its combo box.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode -->
Identifies how the user can interact with a particular cell.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Inert -->
The cell is just for display
 and cannot be interacted with. Note that this doesn’t mean that eg. the
 row being drawn can’t be selected -- just that a particular element of
 it cannot be individually modified.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Activatable -->
The cell can be clicked.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Editable -->
The cell can be edited or otherwise modified.
<!-- struct CellRendererPixbuf -->
A `CellRendererPixbuf` can be used to render an image in a cell. It allows
to render either a given `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf` property) or a named icon (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:icon-name` property).

To support the tree view, `CellRendererPixbuf` also supports rendering two
alternative pixbufs, when the `CellRenderer:is-expander` property is `true`.
If the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `true` and the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-open` property is set to a pixbuf, it
renders that pixbuf, if the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `false`
and the `CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-closed` property is set to a
pixbuf, it renders that one.

indicate that some progress is made, without specifying exactly how
much.

Each increment of the property causes the block to move by a little
bit.

To indicate that the activity has not started yet, set the property
to zero. To indicate completion, set the property to `G_MAXINT`.

<!-- struct CellRendererSpin -->
`CellRendererSpin` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererSpin` offers a `SpinButton` widget. Of course,
that means that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.

The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the
cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the
tree model, like all properties of cell renders. `CellRendererSpin`
also has properties for the `CellRendererSpin:climb-rate` and the number
of `CellRendererSpin:digits` to display. Other `SpinButton` properties
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

The `CellRendererSpin` cell renderer was added in GTK 2.10.

<!-- struct CellRendererSpinner -->
`CellRendererSpinner` renders a spinning animation in a cell, very
similar to `Spinner`. It can often be used as an alternative
to a `CellRendererProgress` for displaying indefinite activity,
instead of actual progress.

To start the animation in a cell, set the `CellRendererSpinner:active`
property to `true` and increment the `CellRendererSpinner:pulse` property
at regular intervals. The usual way to set the cell renderer properties
for each cell is to bind them to columns in your tree model using e.g.
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`.

<!-- struct CellRendererText -->
A `CellRendererText` renders a given text in its cell, using the font, color and
style information provided by its properties. The text will be ellipsized if it is
too long and the `CellRendererText:ellipsize` property allows it.

If the `CellRenderer:mode` is `CellRendererMode::Editable`,
the `CellRendererText` allows to edit its text using an entry.

<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_fixed_height_from_font -->
Sets the height of a renderer to explicitly be determined by the “font” and
“y_pad” property set on it. Further changes in these properties do not
affect the height, so they must be accompanied by a subsequent call to this
function. Using this function is unflexible, and should really only be used
if calculating the size of a cell is too slow (ie, a massive number of cells
displayed). If `number_of_rows` is -1, then the fixed height is unset, and
the height is determined by the properties again.
## `number_of_rows`
Number of rows of text each cell renderer is allocated, or -1

Returns whether the cell renderer is active. See
`CellRendererToggleExt::set_active`.

# Returns

`true` if the cell renderer is active.
<!-- trait CellRendererToggleExt::fn get_radio -->
Returns whether we’re rendering radio toggles rather than checkboxes.

# Returns

`true` if we’re rendering radio toggles rather than checkboxes
<!-- trait CellRendererToggleExt::fn set_activatable -->
Makes the cell renderer activatable.
## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- trait CellRendererToggleExt::fn set_active -->
Activates or deactivates a cell renderer.
## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- trait CellRendererToggleExt::fn set_radio -->
If `radio` is `true`, the cell renderer renders a radio toggle
(i.e. a toggle in a group of mutually-exclusive toggles).
If `false`, it renders a check toggle (a standalone boolean option).
This can be set globally for the cell renderer, or changed just
before rendering each cell in the model (for `TreeView`, you set
up a per-row setting using `TreeViewColumn` to associate model
columns with cell renderer properties).
## `radio`
`true` to make the toggle look like a radio button
<!-- trait CellRendererToggleExt::fn connect_toggled -->
The ::toggled signal is emitted when the cell is toggled.

It is the responsibility of the application to update the model
with the correct value to store at `path`. Often this is simply the
opposite of the value currently stored at `path`.
## `path`
string representation of `TreePath` describing the
 event location
<!-- struct CellView -->
A `CellView` displays a single row of a `TreeModel` using a `CellArea`
and `CellAreaContext`. A `CellAreaContext` can be provided to the
`CellView` at construction time in order to keep the cellview in context
of a group of cell views, this ensures that the renderers displayed will
be properly aligned with eachother (like the aligned cells in the menus
of `ComboBox`).

`CellView` is `Orientable` in order to decide in which orientation
the underlying `CellAreaContext` should be allocated. Taking the `ComboBox`
menu as an example, cellviews should be oriented horizontally if the menus are
listed top-to-bottom and thus all share the same width but may have separate
individual heights (left-to-right menus should be allocated vertically since
they all share the same height but may have variable widths).

# CSS nodes

`CellView` has a single CSS node with name cellview.

<!-- struct CenterBox -->
The `CenterBox` widget arranges three children in a horizontal
or vertical arrangement, keeping the middle child centered as well
as possible.

To add children to `CenterBox`, use `CenterBox::set_start_widget`,
`CenterBox::set_center_widget` and `CenterBox::set_end_widget`.

The sizing and positioning of children can be influenced with the
align and expand properties of the children.

# `CenterBox` as `Buildable`

The `CenterBox` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing children in the 3 positions by specifying “start”, “center” or
“end” as the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

# CSS nodes

`CenterBox` uses a single CSS node with the name “box”,

The first child of the `CenterBox` will be allocated depending on the
text direction, i.e. in left-to-right layouts it will be allocated on the
left and in right-to-left layouts on the right.

In vertical orientation, the nodes of the children are arranged from top to
bottom.

<!-- struct CheckButton -->
A `CheckButton` places a discrete `ToggleButton` next to a widget,
(usually a `Label`). See the section on `ToggleButton` widgets for
more information about toggle/check buttons.

The important signal ( `ToggleButton::toggled` ) is also inherited from
`ToggleButton`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
checkbutton
├── check
╰── <child>

A `CheckButton` with indicator (see `CheckButtonExt::set_draw_indicator`) has a
main CSS node with name checkbutton and a subnode with name check.


```plain
button.check

```

A `CheckButton` without indicator changes the name of its main node
to button and adds a .check style class to it. The subnode is invisible
in this case.

<!-- trait ColorChooserExtManual::fn add_palette -->
Adds a palette to the color chooser. If `orientation` is horizontal,
the colors are grouped in rows, with `colors_per_line` colors
in each row. If `horizontal` is `false`, the colors are grouped
in columns instead.

The default color palette of `ColorChooserWidget` has
27 colors, organized in columns of 3 colors. The default gray
palette has 9 grays in a single row.

The layout of the color chooser widget works best when the
palettes have 9-10 columns.

Calling this function for the first time has the
side effect of removing the default color and gray palettes
from the color chooser.

If `colors` is `None`, removes all previously added palettes.
## `orientation`
`Orientation::Horizontal` if the palette should
 be displayed in rows, `Orientation::Vertical` for columns
## `colors_per_line`

<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_rgba -->
Gets the currently-selected color.
## `color`
a `gdk::RGBA` to fill in with the current color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_use_alpha -->
Returns whether the color chooser shows the alpha channel.

# Returns

`true` if the color chooser uses the alpha channel,
 `false` if not
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_rgba -->
Sets the color.
## `color`
the new color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_use_alpha -->
Sets whether or not the color chooser should use the alpha channel.
## `use_alpha`
`true` if color chooser should use alpha channel, `false` if not
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn connect_color_activated -->
Emitted when a color is activated from the color chooser.
This usually happens when the user clicks a color swatch,
or a color is selected and the user presses one of the keys
Space, Shift+Space, Return or Enter.
## `color`
the color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_property_rgba -->
The ::rgba property contains the currently selected color,
as a `gdk::RGBA` struct. The property can be set to change
the current selection programmatically.

The ::rgba property contains the currently selected color,
as a `gdk::RGBA` struct. The property can be set to change
the current selection programmatically.
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_property_use_alpha -->
When ::use-alpha is `true`, colors may have alpha (translucency)
information. When it is `false`, the `gdk::RGBA` struct obtained
via the `ColorChooser:rgba` property will be forced to have
alpha == 1.

Implementations are expected to show alpha by rendering the color
over a non-uniform background (like a checkerboard pattern).
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_property_use_alpha -->
When ::use-alpha is `true`, colors may have alpha (translucency)

<!-- struct ColorChooserWidget -->
The `ColorChooserWidget` widget lets the user select a
color. By default, the chooser presents a predefined palette
of colors, plus a small number of settable custom colors.
It is also possible to select a different color with the
single-color editor. To enter the single-color editing mode,
use the context menu of any color of the palette, or use the
'+' button to add a new custom color.

The chooser automatically remembers the last selection, as well
as custom colors.

To change the initially selected color, use `ColorChooser::set_rgba`.
To get the selected color use `ColorChooser::get_rgba`.

The `ColorChooserWidget` is used in the `ColorChooserDialog`
to provide a dialog for selecting colors.

is showing the single-color editor. It can be set to switch
the color chooser into single-color editing mode.
<!-- struct ComboBox -->
A `ComboBox` is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
valid choices. The `ComboBox` displays the selected choice. When
activated, the `ComboBox` displays a popup which allows the user to
make a new choice. The style in which the selected value is displayed,
and the style of the popup is determined by the current theme. It may
be similar to a Windows-style combo box.

The `ComboBox` uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
would in a tree view. This is possible since `ComboBox` implements the
`CellLayout` interface. The tree model holding the valid choices is
not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the popup will
reflect the tree structure.

To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the “has-entry”
property allows the `ComboBox` to contain a `Entry`. This entry
can be accessed by calling `BinExt::get_child` on the combo box.

For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of `ComboBox`
can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, `ComboBoxText` offers a
simple alternative. Both `ComboBox` and `ComboBoxText` can contain
an entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
combobox
├── box.linked
│   ╰── button.combo
│       ╰── box
│           ├── cellview
│           ╰── arrow
╰── window.popup
```

A normal combobox contains a box with the .linked class, a button
with the .combo class and inside those buttons, there are a cellview and
an arrow.


```plain
combobox
├── box.linked
│   ├── entry.combo
│   ╰── button.combo
│       ╰── box
│           ╰── arrow
╰── window.popup
```

A `ComboBox` with an entry has a single CSS node with name combobox. It
contains a box with the .linked class. That box contains an entry and a
button, both with the .combo class added.
The button also contains another node with name arrow.

<!-- trait ComboBoxExtManual::fn get_active -->
Returns the index of the currently active item, or -1 if there’s no
active item. If the model is a non-flat treemodel, and the active item
is not an immediate child of the root of the tree, this function returns
`gtk_tree_path_get_indices (path)[0]`, where

Returns the ID of the active row of `self`. This value is taken
from the active row and the column specified by the `ComboBox:id-column`
property of `self` (see `ComboBoxExt::set_id_column`).

The returned value is an interned string which means that you can
compare the pointer by value to other interned strings and that you
must not free it.

If the `ComboBox:id-column` property of `self` is not set, or if
no row is active, or if the active row has a `None` ID value, then `None`
is returned.

# Returns

the ID of the active row, or `None`

This function is mostly intended for use by accessibility technologies;
applications should have little use for it.

Before calling this, `self` must be mapped, or nothing will happen.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn popup_for_device -->
Pops up the menu of `self`. Note that currently this does not do anything
with the device, as it was previously only used for list-mode ComboBoxes,
and those were removed in GTK+ 4. However, it is retained in case similar
functionality is added back later.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`
<!-- trait ComboBoxExtManual::fn set_active -->

`ComboBox:has-entry` as `true`.
## `text_column`
A column in `model` to get the strings from for
 the internal entry
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn set_id_column -->
Sets the model column which `self` should use to get string IDs

<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model used by `self` to be `model`. Will unset a previously set
model (if applicable). If model is `None`, then it will unset the model.

Note that this function does not clear the cell renderers, you have to
call `CellLayout::clear` yourself if you need to set up different
cell renderers for the new model.
## `model`

user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn connect_changed -->
The changed signal is emitted when the active
item is changed. The can be due to the user selecting
a different item from the list, or due to a
call to `ComboBoxExt::set_active_iter`.
It will also be emitted while typing into the entry of a combo box
with an entry.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn connect_format_entry_text -->
For combo boxes that are created with an entry (See `ComboBox`:has-entry).

A signal which allows you to change how the text displayed in a combo box's
entry is displayed.

Connect a signal handler which returns an allocated string representing
`path`. That string will then be used to set the text in the combo box's entry.
The default signal handler uses the text from the `ComboBox`::entry-text-column
model column.

Here's an example signal handler which fetches data from the model and
displays it in the entry.

```C
static gchar*
format_entry_text_callback (GtkComboBox *combo,
                            const gchar *path,
                            gpointer     user_data)
{
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  GtkTreeModel model;
  gdouble      value;

  model = gtk_combo_box_get_model (combo);

  gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model, &iter, path);
  gtk_tree_model_get (model, &iter,
                      THE_DOUBLE_VALUE_COLUMN, &value,
                      -1);

  return g_strdup_printf ("%g", value);
}
```

which gets emitted to popdown the combo box list.

The default bindings for this signal are Alt+Up and Escape.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn connect_popup -->
The ::popup signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to popup the combo box list.

The default binding for this signal is Alt+Down.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn get_property_active -->

and the active item is not an immediate child of the root of the tree,
this property has the value
`gtk_tree_path_get_indices (path)[0]`,
where `path` is the `TreePath` of the active item.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn set_property_active -->
The item which is currently active. If the model is a non-flat treemodel,

<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn get_property_popup_shown -->
Whether the combo boxes dropdown is popped up.
Note that this property is mainly useful, because
it allows you to connect to notify::popup-shown.
<!-- struct ComboBoxText -->
A `ComboBoxText` is a simple variant of `ComboBox` that hides
the model-view complexity for simple text-only use cases.

To create a `ComboBoxText`, use `ComboBoxText::new` or
`ComboBoxText::new_with_entry`.

You can add items to a `ComboBoxText` with
`ComboBoxTextExt::append_text`, `ComboBoxTextExt::insert_text`
or `ComboBoxTextExt::prepend_text` and remove options with
`ComboBoxTextExt::remove`.

If the `ComboBoxText` contains an entry (via the “has-entry” property),
its contents can be retrieved using `ComboBoxTextExt::get_active_text`.
The entry itself can be accessed by calling `BinExt::get_child` on the
combo box.

You should not call `ComboBoxExt::set_model` or attempt to pack more cells
into this combo box via its `CellLayout` interface.

# `ComboBoxText` as `Buildable`

The `ComboBoxText` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding items directly using the `<items>` element and specifying `<item>`
elements for each item. Each `<item>` element can specify the “id”
corresponding to the appended text and also supports the regular
translation attributes “translatable”, “context” and “comments”.

Here is a UI definition fragment specifying `ComboBoxText` items:

```plain
combobox
╰── box.linked
    ├── entry.combo
    ├── button.combo
    ╰── window.popup
```

`ComboBoxText` has a single CSS node with name combobox. It adds
the style class .combo to the main CSS nodes of its entry and button
children, and the .linked class to the node of its internal box.

<!-- struct Container -->
A GTK user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets.
Container widgets are the inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets:
they contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a `Window`
containing a `Frame` containing a `Label`. If you wanted an image instead
of a textual label inside the frame, you might replace the `Label` widget
with a `Image` widget.

There are two major kinds of container widgets in GTK. Both are subclasses
of the abstract `Container` base class.

The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives
from `Bin`. These containers are decorators, which
add some kind of functionality to the child. For example, a `Button` makes
its child into a clickable button; a `Frame` draws a frame around its child
and a `Window` places its child widget inside a top-level window.

The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is to
manage layout. This means that these containers assign
sizes and positions to their children. For example, a horizontal `Box` arranges its
children in a horizontal row, and a `Grid` arranges the widgets it contains
in a two-dimensional grid.

For implementations of `Container` the virtual method `ContainerClass.forall`()
is always required, since it's used for drawing and other internal operations
on the children.
If the `Container` implementation expect to have non internal children
it's needed to implement both `ContainerClass.add`() and `ContainerClass.remove`().
If the `Container` implementation has internal children, they should be added
with `WidgetExt::set_parent` on `init` and removed with `WidgetExt::unparent`
in the `WidgetClass.destroy`() implementation.

<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn add -->
Adds `widget` to `self`. Typically used for simple containers
such as `Window`, `Frame`, or `Button`; for more complicated
layout containers such `Grid`, this function will
pick default packing parameters that may not be correct. So
consider functions such as `GridExt::attach` as an alternative
to `ContainerExt::add` in those cases. A widget may be added to
only one container at a time; you can’t place the same widget
inside two different containers.

Note that some containers, such as `ScrolledWindow` or `ListBox`,
may add intermediate children between the added widget and the
container.
## `widget`
a widget to be placed inside `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn child_type -->
Returns the type of the children supported by the container.

Note that this may return `G_TYPE_NONE` to indicate that no more
children can be added, e.g. for a `Paned` which already has two
children.

# Returns

a `glib::Type`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn forall -->
Invokes `callback` on each direct child of `self`, including
children that are considered “internal” (implementation details
of the container). “Internal” children generally weren’t added
by the user of the container, but were added by the container
implementation itself.

Most applications should use `ContainerExt::foreach`, rather
than `ContainerExt::forall`.
## `callback`
a callback
## `callback_data`
callback user data
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn foreach -->
Invokes `callback` on each non-internal child of `self`.
See `ContainerExt::forall` for details on what constitutes
an “internal” child. For all practical purposes, this function
should iterate over precisely those child widgets that were
added to the container by the application with explicit `add`
calls.

It is permissible to remove the child from the `callback` handler.

Most applications should use `ContainerExt::foreach`,
rather than `ContainerExt::forall`.
## `callback`
a callback
## `callback_data`
callback user data
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_children -->
Returns the container’s non-internal children. See
`ContainerExt::forall` for details on what constitutes an "internal" child.

# Returns

a newly-allocated list of the container’s non-internal children.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_hadjustment -->
Retrieves the horizontal focus adjustment for the container. See
gtk_container_set_focus_hadjustment ().

# Returns

the horizontal focus adjustment, or `None` if
 none has been set.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_focus_vadjustment -->
Retrieves the vertical focus adjustment for the container. See
`ContainerExt::set_focus_vadjustment`.

# Returns

the vertical focus adjustment, or
 `None` if none has been set.
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn get_path_for_child -->
Returns a newly created widget path representing all the widget hierarchy
from the toplevel down to and including `child`.
## `child`
a child of `self`

# Returns

A newly created `WidgetPath`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn remove -->
Removes `widget` from `self`. `widget` must be inside `self`.
Note that `self` will own a reference to `widget`, and that this
may be the last reference held; so removing a widget from its
container can destroy that widget. If you want to use `widget`
again, you need to add a reference to it before removing it from
a container, using `gobject::ObjectExt::ref`. If you don’t want to use `widget`
again it’s usually more efficient to simply destroy it directly
using `WidgetExt::destroy` since this will remove it from the
container and help break any circular reference count cycles.
## `widget`
a current child of `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_hadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in a container, so when a child
of the container is focused, the adjustment is scrolled to show that
widget. This function sets the horizontal alignment.
See `ScrolledWindowExt::get_hadjustment` for a typical way of obtaining
the adjustment and `ContainerExt::set_focus_vadjustment` for setting
the vertical adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same coordinate
system as the allocation for immediate children of the container.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted when the focus is
 moved among the descendents of `self`
<!-- trait ContainerExt::fn set_focus_vadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in a container, so when a
child of the container is focused, the adjustment is scrolled to
show that widget. This function sets the vertical alignment. See
`ScrolledWindowExt::get_vadjustment` for a typical way of obtaining
the adjustment and `ContainerExt::set_focus_hadjustment` for setting
the horizontal adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same coordinate
system as the allocation for immediate children of the container.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted when the focus
 is moved among the descendents of `self`

 widget.
<!-- struct CssLocation -->
`CssLocation` is used to present a location in a file - or other
source of data parsed by the CSS engine.

The `bytes` and `line_bytes` offsets are meant to be used to
programmatically match data. The `lines` and `line_chars` offsets
can be used for printing the location in a file.

Note that the `lines` parameter starts from 0 and is increased
whenever a CSS line break is encountered. (CSS defines the C character
sequences "\r\n", "\r", "\n" and "\f" as newlines.)
If your document uses different rules for line breaking, you might want
run into problems here.
<!-- struct CssProvider -->
`CssProvider` is an object implementing the `StyleProvider` interface.
It is able to parse [CSS-like][css-overview] input in order to style widgets.

An application can make GTK+ parse a specific CSS style sheet by calling
`CssProviderExt::load_from_file` or `CssProviderExt::load_from_resource`
and adding the provider with `StyleContextExt::add_provider` or
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

In addition, certain files will be read when GTK+ is initialized. First, the
file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` is loaded if it exists. Then, GTK+
loads the first existing file among
`XDG_DATA_HOME/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`,
`$HOME/.themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`,
`$XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css` and
`DATADIR/share/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`, where `THEME` is the name of
the current theme (see the `Settings:gtk-theme-name` setting),
VARIANT is the variant to load (see the `Settings:gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` setting), `DATADIR`
is the prefix configured when GTK+ was compiled (unless overridden by the
`GTK_DATA_PREFIX` environment variable), and `VERSION` is the GTK+ version number.
If no file is found for the current version, GTK+ tries older versions all the
way back to 4.0.

# Implements

[`CssProviderExt`](trait.CssProviderExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`StyleProviderExt`](trait.StyleProviderExt.html)
<!-- trait CssProviderExt -->
Trait containing all `CssProvider` methods.

# Implementors

[`CssProvider`](struct.CssProvider.html)
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn new -->
Returns a newly created `CssProvider`.

# Returns

A new `CssProvider`
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn load_from_data -->
Loads `data` into `self`, and by doing so clears any previously loaded
information.
## `data`
CSS data loaded in memory
## `length`
the length of `data` in bytes, or -1 for NUL terminated strings. If
 `length` is not -1, the code will assume it is not NUL terminated and will
 potentially do a copy.
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn load_from_file -->
Loads the data contained in `file` into `self`, making it
clear any previously loaded information.
## `file`
`gio::File` pointing to a file to load
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn load_from_path -->
Loads the data contained in `path` into `self`, making it clear
any previously loaded information.
## `path`
the path of a filename to load, in the GLib filename encoding
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn load_from_resource -->
Loads the data contained in the resource at `resource_path` into
the `CssProvider`, clearing any previously loaded information.

To track errors while loading CSS, connect to the
`CssProvider::parsing-error` signal.
## `resource_path`
a `gio::Resource` resource path
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn load_named -->
Loads a theme from the usual theme paths. The actual process of
finding the theme might change between releases, but it is
guaranteed that this function uses the same mechanism to load the
theme that GTK uses for loading its own theme.
## `name`
A theme name
## `variant`
variant to load, for example, "dark", or
 `None` for the default
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn to_string -->
Converts the `self` into a string representation in CSS
format.

Using `CssProviderExt::load_from_data` with the return value
from this function on a new provider created with
`CssProvider::new` will basically create a duplicate of
this `self`.

# Returns

a new string representing the `self`.
<!-- trait CssProviderExt::fn connect_parsing_error -->
Signals that a parsing error occurred. the `path`, `line` and `position`
describe the actual location of the error as accurately as possible.

Parsing errors are never fatal, so the parsing will resume after
the error. Errors may however cause parts of the given
data or even all of it to not be parsed at all. So it is a useful idea
to check that the parsing succeeds by connecting to this signal.

Note that this signal may be emitted at any time as the css provider
may opt to defer parsing parts or all of the input to a later time
than when a loading function was called.
## `section`
section the error happened in
## `error`
The parsing error
<!-- struct CssSection -->
Defines a part of a CSS document. Because sections are nested into
one another, you can use `CssSection::get_parent` to get the
containing region.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn new -->
Creates a new `CssSection` referring to the section
in the given `file` from the `start` location to the
`end` location.
## `file`
The file this section refers to
## `start`
The start location
## `end`
The end location

# Returns

a new `CssSection`
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_end_location -->
Returns the location in the CSS document where this section ends.

# Returns

The end location of
 this section
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_file -->
Gets the file that `self` was parsed from. If no such file exists,
for example because the CSS was loaded via
`CssProviderExt::load_from_data`(), then `None` is returned.

# Returns

the `gio::File` that `self` was parsed from
 or `None` if `self` was parsed from other data
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_parent -->
Gets the parent section for the given `self`. The parent section is
the section that contains this `self`. A special case are sections of
type `GTK_CSS_SECTION_DOCUMENT`. Their parent will either be `None`
if they are the original CSS document that was loaded by
`CssProviderExt::load_from_file` or a section of type
`GTK_CSS_SECTION_IMPORT` if it was loaded with an import rule from
a different file.

# Returns

the parent section or `None` if none
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_start_location -->
Returns the location in the CSS document where this section starts.

# Returns

The start location of
 this section
<!-- impl CssSection::fn print -->
Prints the `self` into `string` in a human-readable form. This
is a form like `gtk.css:32:1-23` to denote line 32, characters
1 to 23 in the file gtk.css.
## `string`
a `glib::String` to print to
<!-- impl CssSection::fn ref -->
Increments the reference count on `self`.

# Returns

`self` itself.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn to_string -->
Prints the section into a human-readable text form using
`CssSection::print`.

# Returns

A new string.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn unref -->
Decrements the reference count on `self`, freeing the
structure if the reference count reaches 0.
<!-- struct CustomLayout -->

<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Chars -->
Delete characters.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant WordEnds -->
Delete only the portion of the word to the
 left/right of cursor if we’re in the middle of a word.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Words -->
Delete words.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant DisplayLines -->
Delete display-lines. Display-lines
 refers to the visible lines, with respect to to the current line
 breaks. As opposed to paragraphs, which are defined by line
 breaks in the input.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant DisplayLineEnds -->
Delete only the portion of the
 display-line to the left/right of cursor.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant ParagraphEnds -->
Delete to the end of the
 paragraph. Like C-k in Emacs (or its reverse).
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Paragraphs -->
Delete entire line. Like C-k in pico.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Whitespace -->
Delete only whitespace. Like M-\ in Emacs.
<!-- struct Dialog -->
Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
of input, e.g. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.

GTK+ treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a
`Box`, and is where widgets such as a `Label` or a `Entry` should
be packed. The bottom area is known as the
“action area”. This is generally used for
packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as
cancel, ok, or apply.

`Dialog` boxes are created with a call to `Dialog::new` or
`Dialog::new_with_buttons`. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` is
recommended; it allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient
flags, and add simple buttons.

A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
from user input), can be created by calling `GtkWindowExt::set_modal` on the
dialog. Use the GTK_WINDOW() macro to cast the widget returned from
`Dialog::new` into a `Window`. When using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`
you can also pass the `DialogFlags::Modal` flag to make a dialog modal.

If you add buttons to `Dialog` using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`,
`DialogExt::add_button`, `DialogExt::add_buttons`, or
`DialogExt::add_action_widget`, clicking the button will emit a signal
called `Dialog::response` with a response ID that you specified. GTK+
will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely
user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the
`ResponseType` enumeration (these all have values less than zero). If
a dialog receives a delete event, the `Dialog::response` signal will
be emitted with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.

If you want to block waiting for a dialog to return before returning
control flow to your code, you can call `Dialog::run`. This function
enters a recursive main loop and waits for the user to respond to the
dialog, returning the response ID corresponding to the button the user
clicked.

For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you’d probably
use `MessageDialog` to save yourself some effort. But you’d need to
create the dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message
in the dialog.

An example for simple `Dialog` usage:

```C
// Function to open a dialog box with a message
void
quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, gchar *message)
{
 GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
 GtkDialogFlags flags;

 // Create the widgets
 flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
                                       parent,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
                                       NULL);
 content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 label = gtk_label_new (message);

 // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds

 g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
                           "response",
                           G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy),
                           dialog);

 // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added

 gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (content_area), label);
 gtk_widget_show (dialog);
}
```

# `Dialog` as `Buildable`

The `Dialog` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes the
`content_area` and `action_area` as internal children with the names
“content_area” and “action_area”.

`Dialog` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`). To mark a response
as default, set the “default“ attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
to true.

`Dialog` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action“ as
the “type“ attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
on the “use-header-bar“ property. The response id has to be associated
with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.

An example of a `Dialog` UI definition fragment:

```text
<object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>
  </child>
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok">
    </object>
  </child>
  <action-widgets>
    <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>
    <action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget>
  </action-widgets>
</object>
```

<!-- impl Dialog::fn new -->
Creates a new dialog box.

Widgets should not be packed into this `Window`
directly, but into the `content_area` and `action_area`, as described above.

# Returns

the new dialog as a `Widget`
<!-- impl Dialog::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `Dialog` with title `title` (or `None` for the default
title; see `GtkWindowExt::set_title`) and transient parent `parent` (or
`None` for none; see `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`). The `flags`
argument can be used to make the dialog modal (`DialogFlags::Modal`)
and/or to have it destroyed along with its transient parent
(`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent`). After `flags`, button
text/response ID pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending
the list. Button text can be arbitrary text. A response ID can be
any positive number, or one of the values in the `ResponseType`
enumeration. If the user clicks one of these dialog buttons,
`Dialog` will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with the corresponding
response ID. If a `Dialog` receives a delete event,
it will emit ::response with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.
However, destroying a dialog does not emit the ::response signal;
so be careful relying on ::response when using the
`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent` flag. Buttons are from left to right,
so the first button in the list will be the leftmost button in the dialog.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 GtkWidget *main_app_window; // Window the dialog should show up on
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("My dialog",
                                       main_app_window,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                       _("_Cancel"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_REJECT,
                                       NULL);
```
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`
## `flags`
from `DialogFlags`
## `first_button_text`
text to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Dialog`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_action_widget -->
Adds an activatable widget to the action area of a `Dialog`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `Dialog::response`
signal on the dialog when the widget is activated. The widget is
appended to the end of the dialog’s action area. If you want to add a
non-activatable widget, simply pack it into the `action_area` field
of the `Dialog` struct.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with
the given `response_id`. The button is appended to the end of the
dialog’s action area. The button widget is returned, but usually
you don’t need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget that was added
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `DialogExt::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `Dialog::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_content_area -->
Returns the content area of `self`.

# Returns

the content area `Box`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_header_bar -->
Returns the header bar of `self`. Note that the
headerbar is only used by the dialog if the
`Dialog:use-header-bar` property is `true`.

# Returns

the header bar
<!-- trait DialogExtManual::fn get_response_for_widget -->
Gets the response id of a widget in the action area
of a dialog.
## `widget`
a widget in the action area of `self`

# Returns

the response id of `widget`, or `ResponseType::None`
 if `widget` doesn’t have a response id set.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_widget_for_response -->
Gets the widget button that uses the given response ID in the action area
of a dialog.
## `response_id`
the response ID used by the `self` widget

# Returns

the `widget` button that uses the given
 `response_id`, or `None`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn response -->
Emits the `Dialog::response` signal with the given response ID.
Used to indicate that the user has responded to the dialog in some way;
typically either you or `Dialog::run` will be monitoring the
::response signal and take appropriate action.
## `response_id`
response ID
<!-- trait DialogExtManual::fn run -->
Blocks in a recursive main loop until the `self` either emits the
`Dialog::response` signal, or is destroyed. If the dialog is
destroyed during the call to `Dialog::run`, `Dialog::run` returns
`ResponseType::None`. Otherwise, it returns the response ID from the
::response signal emission.

Before entering the recursive main loop, `Dialog::run` calls
`WidgetExt::show` on the dialog for you. Note that you still
need to show any children of the dialog yourself.

During `Dialog::run`, the default behavior of delete events
is disabled; if the dialog receives a delete event, it will not be
destroyed as windows usually are, and `Dialog::run` will return
`ResponseType::DeleteEvent`. Also, during `Dialog::run` the dialog
will be modal. You can force `Dialog::run` to return at any time by
calling `DialogExt::response` to emit the ::response signal. Destroying
the dialog during `Dialog::run` is a very bad idea, because your
post-run code won’t know whether the dialog was destroyed or not.

After `Dialog::run` returns, you are responsible for hiding or
destroying the dialog if you wish to do so.

Typical usage of this function might be:

```C
  GtkWidget *dialog = gtk_dialog_new ();
  // Set up dialog...

  int result = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
  switch (result)
    {
      case GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT:
         // do_application_specific_something ();
         break;
      default:
         // do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled ();
         break;
    }
  gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

Note that even though the recursive main loop gives the effect of a
modal dialog (it prevents the user from interacting with other
windows in the same window group while the dialog is run), callbacks
such as timeouts, IO channel watches, DND drops, etc, will
be triggered during a `Dialog::run` call.

# Returns

response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_default_response -->
Sets the last widget in the dialog’s action area with the given `response_id`
as the default widget for the dialog. Pressing “Enter” normally activates
the default widget.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_response_sensitive -->
Calls `gtk_widget_set_sensitive (widget, @setting)`
for each widget in the dialog’s action area with the given `response_id`.
A convenient way to sensitize/desensitize dialog buttons.
## `response_id`
a response ID
## `setting`
`true` for sensitive
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user uses a keybinding to close
the dialog.

The default binding for this signal is the Escape key.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when an action widget is clicked, the dialog receives a
delete event, or the application programmer calls `DialogExt::response`.
On a delete event, the response ID is `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.
Otherwise, it depends on which action widget was clicked.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the dialog uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the dialog uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- enum DirectionType -->
Focus movement types.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant TabForward -->
Move forward.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant TabBackward -->
Move backward.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Up -->
Move up.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Down -->
Move down.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Left -->
Move left.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Right -->
Move right.
<!-- enum DragResult -->
Gives an indication why a drag operation failed.
The value can by obtained by connecting to the
`Widget::drag-failed` signal.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant Success -->
The drag operation was successful.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant NoTarget -->
No suitable drag target.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant UserCancelled -->
The user cancelled the drag operation.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant TimeoutExpired -->
The drag operation timed out.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant GrabBroken -->
The pointer or keyboard grab used
 for the drag operation was broken.
<!-- enum DragResult::variant Error -->
The drag operation failed due to some
 unspecified error.
<!-- struct DrawingArea -->
The `DrawingArea` widget is used for creating custom user interface
elements. It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:

- The `Widget::realize` signal to take any necessary actions
 when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
 (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)

- The `Widget::size-allocate` signal to take any necessary
 actions when the widget changes size.

- Call `DrawingAreaExt::set_draw_func` to handle redrawing the
 contents of the widget.

The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
color.

## Simple `DrawingArea` usage


```C
void
draw_function (GtkDrawingArea *area, cairo_t *cr,
               int width, int height,
               gpointer data)
{
  GdkRGBA color;
  GtkStyleContext *context;

  context = gtk_widget_get_style_context (GTK_WIDGET (area));

  cairo_arc (cr,
             width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
             MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
             0, 2 * G_PI);

  gtk_style_context_get_color (context,
                               &color);
  gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);

  cairo_fill (cr);
}

void main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  gtk_init ();

  GtkWidget *area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
  gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
  gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
  gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area),
                                  draw_function,
                                  NULL, NULL);

}
```

The draw function is normally called when a drawing area first comes
onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
You can also force a redraw by adding to the “damage region” of the
drawing area’s window using `gtk_widget_queue_draw_region`,
`gtk_widget_queue_draw_area` or `WidgetExt::queue_draw`.
This will cause the drawing area to call the draw function again.

The available routines for drawing are documented on the
[GDK Drawing Primitives][gdk3-Cairo-Interaction] page
and the cairo documentation.

To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable
them with `gtk_widget_add_events`. To receive keyboard events, you
will need to set the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you
should probably draw some user-visible indication that the drawing
area is focused. Use `WidgetExt::has_focus` in your expose event
handler to decide whether to draw the focus indicator. See
`gtk_render_focus` for one way to draw focus.

If you need more complex control over your widget, you should consider
creating your own `Widget` subclass.

<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_content_height -->
Sets the desired height of the contents of the drawing area. Note that
because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested, it is
possible that the actual height passed to your draw function is larger
than the height set here. You can use `WidgetExt::set_valign` to avoid
that.

If the height is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear.
## `height`
the height of contents
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_content_width -->
Sets the desired width of the contents of the drawing area. Note that
because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested, it is
possible that the actual width passed to your draw function is larger
than the width set here. You can use `WidgetExt::set_halign` to avoid
that.

If the width is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear.
## `width`
the width of contents
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_draw_func -->
Setting a draw function is the main thing you want to do when using a drawing
area. It is called whenever GTK needs to draw the contents of the drawing area
to the screen.

The draw function will be called during the drawing stage of GTK. In the
drawing stage it is not allowed to change properties of any GTK widgets or call
any functions that would cause any properties to be changed.
You should restrict yourself exclusively to drawing your contents in the draw
function.

If what you are drawing does change, call `WidgetExt::queue_draw` on the
drawing area. This will cause a redraw and will call `draw_func` again.
## `draw_func`
callback that lets you draw
 the drawing area's contents
## `user_data`
user data passed to `draw_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_property_content_height -->

<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_property_content_height -->
The content height. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_height` for details.
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_property_content_width -->
The content width. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_width` for details.
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_property_content_width -->
The content width. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_width` for details.
<!-- struct Editable -->
The `Editable` interface is an interface which should be implemented by
text editing widgets, such as `Entry` and `SpinButton`. It contains functions
for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
connect to to modify the behavior of a widget.

As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
the following handler to `Editable::insert-text`, an application
can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.

## Forcing entry to uppercase.


```C
#include <ctype.h>;

void
insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                     const char  *text,
                     int          length,
                     int         *position,
                     gpointer     data)
{
  char *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);

  g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                               (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
  gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
  g_signal_handlers_unblock_by_func (editable,
                                     (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);

  g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (editable, "insert_text");

  g_free (result);
}
```

## Implementing `Editable`

The most likely scenario for implementing `Editable` on your own widget
is that you will embed a `Text` inside a complex widget, and want to
delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. `Editable`
provides some utility functions to make this easy.

In your class_init function, call `Editable::install_properties`,
passing the first available property ID:


```text
static void
my_class_init (MyClass *class)
{
   ...
   g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
   gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
   ...
}
```

In your interface_init function for the `Editable` interface, provide
an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:


```text
GtkEditable *
get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
{
  return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
}

static void
my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
{
  iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
}
```

You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
work by forwarding to the delegate that the `get_delegate` vfunc returns.

In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
`Editable::init_delegate`:


```text
static void
my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
{
  ...
  self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
  gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
  ...
}
```

In your dispose function, call `Editable::finish_delegate` before
destroying your text widget:


```text
static void
my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
{
  ...
  gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
  g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
  ...
}
```

Finally, use `Editable::delegate_set_property` in your set_property
function (and similar for get_property), to set the editable properties:


```text
  ...
  if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
    return;

  switch (prop_id)
  ...
```

after installing your own properties.

To handle the properties in your set_property and get_property
functions, you can either use `Editable::delegate_set_property`
and `Editable::delegate_get_property` (if you are using a delegate),
or remember the `first_prop` offset and add it to the values in the
`EditableProperties` enumeration to get the property IDs for these
properties.
## `object_class`
a `gobject::ObjectClass`
## `first_prop`
property ID to use for the first property

# Returns

`start_pos` will be filled with the start of the selection and
`end_pos` with end. If no text was selected both will be identical
and `false` will be returned.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
location to store the starting position, or `None`
## `end_pos`
location to store the end position, or `None`

# Returns

`true` if there is a non-empty selection, `false` otherwise

<!-- trait EditableExt::fn init_delegate -->
Sets up a delegate for `Editable`, assuming that the
get_delegate vfunc in the `Editable` interface has been
set up for the `self`'s type.

This is a helper function that should be called in instance init,
after creating the delegate object.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn insert_text -->
Inserts `length` bytes of `text` into the contents of the
widget, at position `position`.

Note that the position is in characters, not in bytes.
The function updates `position` to point after the newly inserted text.
## `text`
the text to append
## `length`
the length of the text in bytes, or -1
## `position`
location of the position text will be inserted at
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn select_region -->
Selects a region of text.

The characters that are selected are those characters at positions
from `start_pos` up to, but not including `end_pos`. If `end_pos` is

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
start of region
## `end_pos`
end of region
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_alignment -->

Sets the desired maximum width in characters of `self`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired maximum width, in characters
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_position -->
Sets the cursor position in the editable to the given value.

The cursor is displayed before the character with the given (base 0)
index in the contents of the editable. The value must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the editable. A value of -1
indicates that the position should be set after the last character
of the editable. Note that `position` is in characters, not in bytes.
## `position`
the position of the cursor
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_text -->
Sets the text in the editable to the given value,
replacing the current contents.
## `text`
the text to set
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_width_chars -->
Changes the size request of the editable to be about the
right size for `n_chars` characters.

Note that it changes the size request, the size can still
be affected by how you pack the widget into containers.
If `n_chars` is -1, the size reverts to the default size.
## `n_chars`
width in chars
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn connect_changed -->
The ::changed signal is emitted at the end of a single
user-visible operation on the contents of the `Editable`.

E.g., a paste operation that replaces the contents of the
selection will cause only one signal emission (even though it
is implemented by first deleting the selection, then inserting
the new content, and may cause multiple ::notify::text signals
to be emitted).
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn connect_delete_text -->
This signal is emitted when text is deleted from
the widget by the user. The default handler for
this signal will normally be responsible for deleting
the text, so by connecting to this signal and then
stopping the signal with `g_signal_stop_emission`, it
is possible to modify the range of deleted text, or
prevent it from being deleted entirely. The `start_pos`
and `end_pos` parameters are interpreted as for
`Editable::delete_text`.
## `start_pos`
the starting position
## `end_pos`
the end position
<!-- trait EditableExtManual::fn connect_insert_text -->
This signal is emitted when text is inserted into
the widget by the user. The default handler for
this signal will normally be responsible for inserting
the text, so by connecting to this signal and then
stopping the signal with `g_signal_stop_emission`, it
is possible to modify the inserted text, or prevent
it from being inserted entirely.
## `text`
the new text to insert
## `length`
the length of the new text, in bytes,
 or -1 if new_text is nul-terminated
## `position`
the position, in characters,
 at which to insert the new text. this is an in-out
 parameter. After the signal emission is finished, it
 should point after the newly inserted text.
<!-- enum EditableProperties -->
<!-- struct Entry -->
The `Entry` widget is a single line text entry
widget. A fairly large set of key bindings are supported
by default. If the entered text is longer than the allocation
of the widget, the widget will scroll so that the cursor
position is visible.

When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
it can be put into “password mode” using `EntryExt::set_visibility`.
In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character that is available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

`Entry` has the ability to display progress or activity
information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
use `EntryExt::set_progress_fraction` or `EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`.

Additionally, `Entry` can show icons at either side of the entry. These
icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source and
can have tooltips. To add an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_from_gicon` or
one of the various other functions that set an icon from an icon name or a
paintable. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon,
connect to the `Entry::icon-press` signal. To allow DND operations
from an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_drag_source`. To set a tooltip on
an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text` or the corresponding function
for markup.

Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
via the context menu of the entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
entry[.flat][.warning][.error]
├── text[.readonly]
├── image.left
├── image.right
├── [progress[.pulse]]
```

`Entry` has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties
of the entry, the style classes .read-only and .flat may appear. The style
classes .warning and .error may also be used with entries.

When the entry shows icons, it adds subnodes with the name image and the
style class .left or .right, depending on where the icon appears.

When the entry shows progress, it adds a subnode with the name progress.
The node has the style class .pulse when the shown progress is pulsing.

For all the subnodes added to the text node in various situations,
see `Text`.

such as search-as-you-type entries.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn progress_pulse -->
Indicates that some progress is made, but you don’t know how much.
Causes the entry’s progress indicator to enter “activity mode,”
where a block bounces back and forth. Each call to

the dialog box containing the entry will be closed, since the default
widget is usually one of the dialog buttons.
## `setting`
`true` to activate window’s default widget on Enter keypress
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_alignment -->
Sets the alignment for the contents of the entry. This controls
the horizontal positioning of the contents when the displayed

this widget.
## `buffer`
a `EntryBuffer`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_completion -->
Sets `completion` to be the auxiliary completion object to use with `self`.
All further configuration of the completion mechanism is done on
`completion` using the `EntryCompletion` API. Completion is disabled if
`completion` is set to `None`.
## `completion`
The `EntryCompletion` or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_has_frame -->
Sets whether the entry has a beveled frame around it.
## `setting`
new value
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_activatable -->
Sets whether the icon is activatable.
## `icon_pos`
Icon position
## `activatable`
`true` if the icon should be activatable
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_drag_source -->
Sets up the icon at the given position so that GTK+ will start a drag
operation when the user clicks and drags the icon.

To handle the drag operation, you need to connect to the usual
`Widget::drag-data-get` (or possibly `Widget::drag-data-delete`)
signal, and use `EntryExt::get_current_icon_drag_source` in
your signal handler to find out if the drag was started from
an icon.

By default, GTK+ uses the icon as the drag icon. You can use the
`Widget::drag-begin` signal to set a different icon. Note that you
have to use `g_signal_connect_after` to ensure that your signal handler
gets executed after the default handler.
## `icon_pos`
icon position
## `formats`
the targets (data formats) in which the data can be provided
## `actions`
a bitmask of the allowed drag actions
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_gicon -->
Sets the icon shown in the entry at the specified position
from the current icon theme.
If the icon isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be displayed
instead.

If `icon` is `None`, no icon will be shown in the specified position.
## `icon_pos`
The position at which to set the icon
## `icon`
The icon to set, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_icon_name -->
Sets the icon shown in the entry at the specified position
from the current icon theme.

If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be displayed
instead.

If `icon_name` is `None`, no icon will be shown in the specified position.
## `icon_pos`
The position at which to set the icon
## `icon_name`
An icon name, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_paintable -->
Sets the icon shown in the specified position using a `gdk::Paintable`

If `paintable` is `None`, no icon will be shown in the specified position.
## `icon_pos`
Icon position

A `gdk::Paintable`, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_sensitive -->
Sets the sensitivity for the specified icon.
## `icon_pos`
Icon position
## `sensitive`
Specifies whether the icon should appear
 sensitive or insensitive
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_tooltip_markup -->
Sets `tooltip` as the contents of the tooltip for the icon at
the specified position. `tooltip` is assumed to be marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text`.
## `icon_pos`
the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_tooltip_text -->
Sets `tooltip` as the contents of the tooltip for the icon
at the specified position.

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_markup`.

If you unset the widget tooltip via `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text` or
`WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup`, this sets `Widget`:has-tooltip to `false`,
which suppresses icon tooltips too. You can resolve this by then calling
`WidgetExt::set_has_tooltip` to set `Widget`:has-tooltip back to `true`, or
setting at least one non-empty tooltip on any icon achieves the same result.
## `icon_pos`
the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_input_hints -->
Sets the `Entry:input-hints` property, which
allows input methods to fine-tune their behaviour.

Sets the `Entry:input-purpose` property which
can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.
## `purpose`
the purpose
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_invisible_char -->
Sets the character to use in place of the actual text when
`EntryExt::set_visibility` has been called to set text visibility
to `false`. i.e. this is the character used in “password mode” to
show the user how many characters have been typed. By default, GTK+
picks the best invisible char available in the current font. If you
set the invisible char to 0, then the user will get no feedback
at all; there will be no text on the screen as they type.
## `ch`
a Unicode character
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the widget. If
the current contents are longer than the given length, then they
will be truncated to fit.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and
calling `EntryBuffer::set_max_length` on it.
]|
## `max`
the maximum length of the entry, or 0 for no maximum.
 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.

Sets whether the text is overwritten when typing in the `Entry`.
## `overwrite`
new value
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_placeholder_text -->

This can be used to give a visual hint of the expected contents of
the `Entry`.
## `text`
a string to be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_fraction -->
Causes the entry’s progress indicator to “fill in” the given
fraction of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_pulse_step -->
Sets the fraction of total entry width to move the progress
bouncing block for each call to `EntryExt::progress_pulse`.

text.
## `tabs`
a `pango::TabArray`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_visibility -->
Sets whether the contents of the entry are visible or not.
When visibility is set to `false`, characters are displayed
as the invisible char, and will also appear that way when
the text in the entry widget is copied elsewhere.

By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

Note that you probably want to set `Entry:input-purpose`
to `InputPurpose::Password` or `InputPurpose::Pin` to
inform input methods about the purpose of this entry,
in addition to setting visibility to `false`.
## `visible`
`true` if the contents of the entry are displayed
 as plaintext
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn unset_invisible_char -->
Unsets the invisible char previously set with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`. So that the
default invisible char is used again.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn connect_icon_press -->

mouse click over an activatable icon.
## `icon_pos`
The position of the clicked icon
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn get_property_attributes -->
A list of Pango attributes to apply to the text of the entry.

This is mainly useful to change the size or weight of the text.

The `pango::Attribute`'s `start_index` and `end_index` must refer to the
`EntryBuffer` text, i.e. without the preedit string.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_property_attributes -->

Setting this to a non-`None` value overrides the
system-wide IM module setting. See the `Settings`
`Settings:gtk-im-module` property.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_property_im_module -->
Which IM (input method) module should be used for this entry.

The `EntryBuffer` class contains the actual text displayed in a
`Entry` widget.

A single `EntryBuffer` object can be shared by multiple `Entry`
widgets which will then share the same text content, but not the cursor
position, visibility attributes, icon etc.

`EntryBuffer` may be derived from. Such a derived class might allow
text to be stored in an alternate location, such as non-pageable memory,
useful in the case of important passwords. Or a derived class could
integrate with an application’s concept of undo/redo.

# Implements

[`EntryBufferExt`](trait.EntryBufferExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt -->
Trait containing all `EntryBuffer` methods.

# Returns

A new `EntryBuffer` object.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn delete_text -->
Deletes a sequence of characters from the buffer. `n_chars` characters are
deleted starting at `position`. If `n_chars` is negative, then all characters
until the end of the text are deleted.

If `position` or `n_chars` are out of bounds, then they are coerced to sane
values.

Note that the positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `position`

 storage in the buffer and must not be freed, modified or
 stored.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn insert_text -->

buffer, at position `position`.

If `n_chars` is negative, then characters from chars will be inserted
until a null-terminator is found. If `position` or `n_chars` are out of
bounds, or the maximum buffer text length is exceeded, then they are
coerced to sane values.

Note that the position and length are in characters, not in bytes.
## `position`

<!-- struct EntryCompletion -->
`EntryCompletion` is an auxiliary object to be used in conjunction with
`Entry` to provide the completion functionality. It implements the
`CellLayout` interface, to allow the user to add extra cells to the
`TreeView` with completion matches.

“Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
in the entry, `EntryCompletion` checks which rows in the model match
the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
`EntryCompletionExt::set_text_column`), but this can be overridden
with a custom match function (see `EntryCompletionExt::set_match_func`).

When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
to the `EntryCompletion::match-selected` signal and updating the
entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return `true` from
the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.

To add completion functionality to an entry, use `EntryExt::set_completion`.

In addition to regular completion matches, which will be inserted into the
entry when they are selected, `EntryCompletion` also allows to display
“actions” in the popup window. Their appearance is similar to menuitems,
to differentiate them clearly from completion strings. When an action is
selected, the `EntryCompletion::action-activated` signal is emitted.

`EntryCompletion` uses a `TreeModelFilter` model to represent the
subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the
`EntryCompletion` signals `EntryCompletion::match-selected` and
`EntryCompletion::cursor-on-match` take the original model and an
iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and signals
(such as ``GtkCellLayoutDataFuncs`` or `CellArea::apply-attributes`)
will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
only calling `TreeModel::get`, this will make no difference to
you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
`TreeModelFilterExt::get_model`. Don’t forget to use
`TreeModelFilterExt::convert_iter_to_child_iter` to obtain a
matching iter.

user data for `func`
## `func_notify`
destroy notify for `func_data`.
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_minimum_key_length -->
Requires the length of the search key for `self` to be at least
`length`. This is useful for long lists, where completing using a small
key takes a lot of time and will come up with meaningless results anyway
(ie, a too large dataset).
## `length`
the minimum length of the key in order to start completing
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `EntryCompletion`. If `self` already has
a model set, it will remove it before setting the new model.
If model is `None`, then it will unset the model.

the `TreeModel`
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_popup_completion -->
Sets whether the completions should be presented in a popup window.
## `popup_completion`

width as the entry.
## `popup_set_width`
`true` to make the width of the popup the same as the entry
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_popup_single_match -->

`true` if the popup should appear even for a single
 match
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_text_column -->
Convenience function for setting up the most used case of this code: a
completion list with just strings. This function will set up `self`
to have a list displaying all (and just) strings in the completion list,
and to get those strings from `column` in the model of `self`.

This functions creates and adds a `CellRendererText` for the selected
column. If you need to set the text column, but don't want the cell
renderer, use `gobject::ObjectExt::set` to set the `EntryCompletion:text-column`
property directly.
## `column`
the column in the model of `self` to get strings from
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn connect_action_activated -->
Gets emitted when an action is activated.
## `index`

of the list. The default behaviour is to replace the contents
of the entry with the contents of the text column in the row
pointed to by `iter`.

Note that `model` is the model that was passed to
`EntryCompletionExt::set_model`.
## `model`
the `TreeModel` containing the matches
## `iter`
a `TreeIter` positioned at the selected match

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn connect_insert_prefix -->

The default behaviour is to make the entry display the
whole prefix and select the newly inserted part.

Applications may connect to this signal in order to insert only a
smaller part of the `prefix` into the entry - e.g. the entry used in
the `FileChooser` inserts only the part of the prefix up to the
next '/'.
## `prefix`
the common prefix of all possible completions

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn connect_match_selected -->
Gets emitted when a match from the list is selected.
The default behaviour is to replace the contents of the
entry with the contents of the text column in the row
pointed to by `iter`.

Note that `model` is the model that was passed to
`EntryCompletionExt::set_model`.
## `model`
the `TreeModel` containing the matches
## `iter`
a `TreeIter` positioned at the selected match

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn connect_no_matches -->
Gets emitted when the filter model has zero
number of rows in completion_complete method.
(In other words when `EntryCompletion` is out of
 suggestions)
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn get_property_cell_area -->

should be inserted automatically in the entry. Note that this
requires text-column to be set, even if you are using a custom
match function.
<!-- trait EntryCompletionExt::fn set_property_inline_completion -->
Determines whether the common prefix of the possible completions
should be inserted automatically in the entry. Note that this
requires text-column to be set, even if you are using a custom
match function.

Determines whether the completions popup window will shown
for a single possible completion. You probably want to set
this to `false` if you are using

<!-- struct EventControllerScroll -->
`EventControllerScroll` is an event controller meant to handle
scroll events from mice and touchpads. It is capable of handling
both discrete and continuous scroll events, abstracting them both
on the `EventControllerScroll::scroll` signal (deltas in the
discrete case are multiples of 1).

In the case of continuous scroll events, `EventControllerScroll`
encloses all `EventControllerScroll::scroll` events between two
`EventControllerScroll::scroll-begin` and `EventControllerScroll::scroll-end`
signals.

The behavior of the event controller can be modified by the
flags given at creation time, or modified at a later point through
`EventControllerScroll::set_flags` (e.g. because the scrolling
conditions of the widget changed).

The controller can be set up to emit motion for either/both vertical
and horizontal scroll events through `EventControllerScrollFlags::Vertical`,
`EventControllerScrollFlags::Horizontal` and `GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_BOTH`.
If any axis is disabled, the respective `EventControllerScroll::scroll`
delta will be 0. Vertical scroll events will be translated to horizontal
motion for the devices incapable of horizontal scrolling.

The event controller can also be forced to emit discrete events on all devices
through `EventControllerScrollFlags::Discrete`. This can be used to implement
discrete actions triggered through scroll events (e.g. switching across
combobox options).

The `EventControllerScrollFlags::Kinetic` flag toggles the emission of the
`EventControllerScroll::decelerate` signal, emitted at the end of scrolling
with two X/Y velocity arguments that are consistent with the motion that
was received.

# Implements

[`EventControllerExt`](trait.EventControllerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl EventControllerScroll::fn new -->
Creates a new event controller that will handle scroll events.

flag is set. `vel_x` and `vel_y` express the initial velocity that was
imprinted by the scroll events. `vel_x` and `vel_y` are expressed in
pixels/ms.
## `vel_x`
X velocity
## `vel_y`
Y velocity
<!-- impl EventControllerScroll::fn connect_scroll -->
Signals that the widget should scroll by the
amount specified by `dx` and `dy`.

The sequence is handled and grabbed.
<!-- enum EventSequenceState::variant Denied -->
The sequence is denied.
<!-- struct Expander -->
A `Expander` allows the user to hide or show its child by clicking
on an expander triangle similar to the triangles used in a `TreeView`.

Normally you use an expander as you would use a descendant
of `Bin`; you create the child widget and use `ContainerExt::add`
to add it to the expander. When the expander is toggled, it will take
care of showing and hiding the child automatically.

# Special Usage

There are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the
expanded widget yourself, such as when you want to actually create
the widget at expansion time. In this case, create a `Expander`
but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an
`Expander:expanded` property which can be used to monitor
its expansion state. You should watch this property with a signal
connection as follows:


```C
static void
expander_callback (GObject    *object,
                   GParamSpec *param_spec,
                   gpointer    user_data)
{
  GtkExpander *expander;

  expander = GTK_EXPANDER (object);

  if (gtk_expander_get_expanded (expander))
    {
      // Show or create widgets
    }
  else
    {
      // Hide or destroy widgets
    }
}

static void
create_expander (void)
{
  GtkWidget *expander = gtk_expander_new_with_mnemonic ("_More Options");
  g_signal_connect (expander, "notify::expanded",
                    G_CALLBACK (expander_callback), NULL);

  // ...
}
```

# `Expander` as `Buildable`

The `Expander` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can be
specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Expander`:

```plain
expander
╰── box
    ├── title
    │   ├── arrow
    │   ╰── <label widget>
    ╰── <child>
```

`Expander` has three CSS nodes, the main node with the name expander,
a subnode with name title and node below it with name arrow. The arrow of an
expander that is showing its child gets the :checked pseudoclass added to it.

<!-- trait ExpanderExt -->
Trait containing all `Expander` methods.

# Implementors

[`Expander`](struct.Expander.html)
<!-- impl Expander::fn new -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
## `label`
the text of the label

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- impl Expander::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
If characters in `label` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined.
If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use “__” (two
underscores). The first underlined character represents a keyboard
accelerator called a mnemonic.
Pressing Alt and that key activates the button.
## `label`
the text of the label with an underscore
 in front of the mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn get_expanded -->
Queries a `Expander` and returns its current state. Returns `true`
if the child widget is revealed.

See `ExpanderExt::set_expanded`.

# Returns

the current state of the expander
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup, as set by
`ExpanderExt::set_label`. If the label text has not been set the
return value will be `None`. This will be the case if you create an
empty button with `Button::new` to use as a container.

Note that this function behaved differently in versions prior to
2.14 and used to return the label text stripped of embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. This problem can
be avoided by fetching the label text directly from the label
widget.

# Returns

The text of the label widget. This string is owned
 by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn get_label_widget -->
Retrieves the label widget for the frame. See
`ExpanderExt::set_label_widget`.

# Returns

the label widget,

# Returns

`true` if the label’s text will be parsed for markup
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns whether an embedded underline in the expander label
indicates a mnemonic. See `ExpanderExt::set_use_underline`.

# Returns

`true` if an embedded underline in the expander
 label indicates the mnemonic accelerator keys
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn set_expanded -->
Sets the state of the expander. Set to `true`, if you want
the child widget to be revealed, and `false` if you want the
child widget to be hidden.
## `expanded`

containing the expander upon resizing and collpasing.
## `resize_toplevel`
whether to resize the toplevel
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn set_use_markup -->
Sets whether the text of the label contains markup in
[Pango’s text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `LabelExt::set_markup`.
## `use_markup`
`true` if the label’s text should be parsed for markup
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text of the expander label indicates
the next character should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `use_underline`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn get_property_resize_toplevel -->
When this property is `true`, the expander will resize the toplevel
widget containing the expander upon expanding and collapsing.
<!-- trait ExpanderExt::fn set_property_resize_toplevel -->
When this property is `true`, the expander will resize the toplevel
widget containing the expander upon expanding and collapsing.
<!-- struct FileChooser -->
`FileChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by file
selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
interface are `FileChooserWidget`, `FileChooserDialog`, and
`FileChooserButton`. You do not need to write an object that
implements the `FileChooser` interface unless you are trying to
adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
interface.

`FileChooser` allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

- Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
 right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
 can be renamed and deleted by the user.

- Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
 program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
 cannot be modified by the user.

- Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
 the “roots” of the filesystem.

# File Names and Encodings

When the user is finished selecting files in a
`FileChooser`, your program can get the selected names
either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal escaping
rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
However, filenames are always returned in
the character set specified by the
`G_FILENAME_ENCODING` environment variable.
Please see the GLib documentation for more details about this
variable.

This means that while you can pass the result of
`FileChooser::get_filename` to `open` or `fopen`,
you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a
`Label` widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8,
which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use `g_filename_to_utf8`
to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+
widgets.

# Adding a Preview Widget

You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then
get notification about when the preview needs to be updated.
To install a preview widget, use
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget`. Then, connect to the
`FileChooser::update-preview` signal to get notified when
you need to update the contents of the preview.

Your callback should use
`FileChooser::get_preview_filename` to see what needs
previewing. Once you have generated the preview for the
corresponding file, you must call
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active` with a boolean
flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully
generate a preview.

## Example: Using a Preview Widget ## {`gtkfilechooser`-preview}

```C
{
  GtkImage *preview;

  ...

  preview = gtk_image_new ();

  gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
  g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
            G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
}

static void

# Adding Extra Widgets

You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
that are not present in the default design. For example, you
can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a
file in read-only mode. You can use
`FileChooser::set_extra_widget` to insert additional
widgets in a file chooser.

An example for adding extra widgets:

```C

  GtkWidget *toggle;

  ...

  toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
  gtk_widget_show (toggle);
  gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
}
```

If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file
chooser, you can a container such as a `Box` or a `Grid`
and include your widgets in it. Then, set the container as
the whole extra widget.

# Implements

[`FileChooserExt`](trait.FileChooserExt.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt -->
Trait containing all `FileChooser` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserButton`](struct.FileChooserButton.html), [`FileChooserDialog`](struct.FileChooserDialog.html), [`FileChooserNative`](struct.FileChooserNative.html), [`FileChooserWidget`](struct.FileChooserWidget.html), [`FileChooser`](struct.FileChooser.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_choice -->
Adds a 'choice' to the file chooser. This is typically implemented
as a combobox or, for boolean choices, as a checkbutton. You can select
a value using `FileChooser::set_choice` before the dialog is shown,
and you can obtain the user-selected value in the ::response signal handler
using `FileChooser::get_choice`.

Compare `FileChooser::set_extra_widget`.
## `id`
id for the added choice
## `label`
user-visible label for the added choice
## `options`
ids for the options of the choice, or `None` for a boolean choice
## `option_labels`
user-visible labels for the options, must be the same length as `options`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_filter -->
Adds `filter` to the list of filters that the user can select between.
When a filter is selected, only files that are passed by that
filter are displayed.

Note that the `self` takes ownership of the filter, so you have to
ref and sink it if you want to keep a reference.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_shortcut_folder -->
Adds a folder to be displayed with the shortcut folders in a file chooser.
Note that shortcut folders do not get saved, as they are provided by the
application. For example, you can use this to add a
“/usr/share/mydrawprogram/Clipart” folder to the volume list.
## `folder`
filename of the folder to add

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be added successfully, `false`
otherwise. In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_shortcut_folder_uri -->
Adds a folder URI to be displayed with the shortcut folders in a file
chooser. Note that shortcut folders do not get saved, as they are provided
by the application. For example, you can use this to add a
“file:///usr/share/mydrawprogram/Clipart” folder to the volume list.
## `uri`
URI of the folder to add

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be added successfully, `false`
otherwise. In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_action -->
Gets the type of operation that the file chooser is performing; see
`FileChooser::set_action`.

# Returns

the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_choice -->
Gets the currently selected option in the 'choice' with the given ID.
## `id`
the ID of the choice to get

# Returns

the ID of the currenly selected option
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_create_folders -->
Gets whether file choser will offer to create new folders.
See `FileChooser::set_create_folders`.

# Returns

`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as a local filename.
See `FileChooser::set_current_folder`.

Note that this is the folder that the file chooser is currently displaying
(e.g. "/home/username/Documents"), which is not the same
as the currently-selected folder if the chooser is in
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder` mode
(e.g. "/home/username/Documents/selected-folder/". To get the
currently-selected folder in that mode, use `FileChooser::get_uri` as the
usual way to get the selection.

# Returns

the full path of the current
folder, or `None` if the current path cannot be represented as a local
filename. Free with `g_free`. This function will also return
`None` if the file chooser was unable to load the last folder that
was requested from it; for example, as would be for calling
`FileChooser::set_current_folder` on a nonexistent folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder_file -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as `gio::File`.
See `FileChooser::get_current_folder_uri`.

# Returns

the `gio::File` for the current folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder_uri -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as an URI.
See `FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri`.

Note that this is the folder that the file chooser is currently displaying
(e.g. "file:///home/username/Documents"), which is not the same
as the currently-selected folder if the chooser is in
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder` mode
(e.g. "file:///home/username/Documents/selected-folder/". To get the
currently-selected folder in that mode, use `FileChooser::get_uri` as the
usual way to get the selection.

# Returns

the URI for the current folder.
Free with `g_free`. This function will also return `None` if the file chooser
was unable to load the last folder that was requested from it; for example,
as would be for calling `FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri` on a
nonexistent folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_name -->
Gets the current name in the file selector, as entered by the user in the
text entry for “Name”.

This is meant to be used in save dialogs, to get the currently typed filename
when the file itself does not exist yet. For example, an application that
adds a custom extra widget to the file chooser for “file format” may want to
change the extension of the typed filename based on the chosen format, say,
from “.jpg” to “.png”.

# Returns

The raw text from the file chooser’s “Name” entry. Free this with
`g_free`. Note that this string is not a full pathname or URI; it is
whatever the contents of the entry are. Note also that this string is in
UTF-8 encoding, which is not necessarily the system’s encoding for filenames.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Queries whether a file chooser is set to confirm for overwriting when the user
types a file name that already exists.

# Returns

`true` if the file chooser will present a confirmation dialog;
`false` otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_extra_widget -->
Gets the current extra widget; see
`FileChooser::set_extra_widget`.

# Returns

the current extra widget, or `None`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_file -->
Gets the `gio::File` for the currently selected file in
the file selector. If multiple files are selected,
one of the files will be returned at random.

If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selected
folder.

# Returns

a selected `gio::File`. You own the returned file;
 use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release it.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filename -->
Gets the filename for the currently selected file in
the file selector. The filename is returned as an absolute path. If
multiple files are selected, one of the filenames will be returned at
random.

If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selected
folder.

# Returns

The currently selected filename,
 or `None` if no file is selected, or the selected file can't
 be represented with a local filename. Free with `g_free`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filenames -->
Lists all the selected files and subfolders in the current folder of
`self`. The returned names are full absolute paths. If files in the current
folder cannot be represented as local filenames they will be ignored. (See
`FileChooser::get_uris`)

# Returns

a `glib::SList`
 containing the filenames of all selected files and subfolders in
 the current folder. Free the returned list with `glib::SList::free`,
 and the filenames with `g_free`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_files -->
Lists all the selected files and subfolders in the current folder of `self`
as `gio::File`. An internal function, see `FileChooser::get_uris`.

# Returns

a `glib::SList`
 containing a `gio::File` for each selected file and subfolder in the
 current folder. Free the returned list with `glib::SList::free`, and
 the files with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filter -->
Gets the current filter; see `FileChooser::set_filter`.

# Returns

the current filter, or `None`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_local_only -->
Gets whether only local files can be selected in the
file selector. See `FileChooser::set_local_only`

# Returns

`true` if only local files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_preview_file -->
Gets the `gio::File` that should be previewed in a custom preview
Internal function, see `FileChooser::get_preview_uri`.

# Returns

the `gio::File` for the file to preview,
 or `None` if no file is selected. Free with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_preview_filename -->
Gets the filename that should be previewed in a custom preview
widget. See `FileChooser::set_preview_widget`.

# Returns

the filename to preview, or `None` if
 no file is selected, or if the selected file cannot be represented
 as a local filename. Free with `g_free`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_preview_uri -->
Gets the URI that should be previewed in a custom preview
widget. See `FileChooser::set_preview_widget`.

# Returns

the URI for the file to preview,
 or `None` if no file is selected. Free with `g_free`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_preview_widget -->
Gets the current preview widget; see
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget`.

# Returns

the current preview widget, or `None`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_preview_widget_active -->
Gets whether the preview widget set by `FileChooser::set_preview_widget`
should be shown for the current filename. See
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active`.

# Returns

`true` if the preview widget is active for the current filename.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_select_multiple -->
Gets whether multiple files can be selected in the file
selector. See `FileChooser::set_select_multiple`.

# Returns

`true` if multiple files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_show_hidden -->
Gets whether hidden files and folders are displayed in the file selector.
See `FileChooser::set_show_hidden`.

# Returns

`true` if hidden files and folders are displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_uri -->
Gets the URI for the currently selected file in
the file selector. If multiple files are selected,
one of the filenames will be returned at random.

If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selected
folder.

# Returns

The currently selected URI, or `None`
 if no file is selected. If `FileChooser::set_local_only` is set to
 `true` (the default) a local URI will be returned for any FUSE locations.
 Free with `g_free`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_uris -->
Lists all the selected files and subfolders in the current folder of
`self`. The returned names are full absolute URIs.

# Returns

a `glib::SList` containing the URIs of all selected
 files and subfolders in the current folder. Free the returned list
 with `glib::SList::free`, and the filenames with `g_free`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_use_preview_label -->
Gets whether a label should be drawn with the name of the previewed
file. See `FileChooser::set_use_preview_label`.

# Returns

`true` if the file chooser is set to display a label with the
name of the previewed file, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn list_filters -->
Lists the current set of user-selectable filters; see
`FileChooser::add_filter`, `FileChooser::remove_filter`.

# Returns

a
 `glib::SList` containing the current set of user selectable filters. The
 contents of the list are owned by GTK+, but you must free the list
 itself with `glib::SList::free` when you are done with it.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn list_shortcut_folder_uris -->
Queries the list of shortcut folders in the file chooser, as set by
`FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder_uri`.

# Returns

A list of
folder URIs, or `None` if there are no shortcut folders. Free the
returned list with `glib::SList::free`, and the URIs with `g_free`.

Removes a 'choice' that has been added with `FileChooser::add_choice`.
## `id`
the ID of the choice to remove
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_filter -->
Removes `filter` from the list of filters that the user can select between.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_shortcut_folder -->
Removes a folder from a file chooser’s list of shortcut folders.
## `folder`
filename of the folder to remove

# Returns

`true` if the operation succeeds, `false` otherwise.
In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.

See also: `FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_shortcut_folder_uri -->
Removes a folder URI from a file chooser’s list of shortcut folders.
## `uri`
URI of the folder to remove

# Returns

`true` if the operation succeeds, `false` otherwise.
In the latter case, the `error` will be set as appropriate.

See also: `FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder_uri`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_all -->
Selects all the files in the current folder of a file chooser.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_file -->
Selects the file referred to by `file`. An internal function. See
`_gtk_file_chooser_select_uri`.
## `file`
the file to select

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_filename -->
Selects a filename. If the file name isn’t in the current
folder of `self`, then the current folder of `self` will
be changed to the folder containing `filename`.
## `filename`
the filename to select

# Returns

Not useful.

See also: `FileChooser::set_filename`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn select_uri -->
Selects the file to by `uri`. If the URI doesn’t refer to a
file in the current folder of `self`, then the current folder of
`self` will be changed to the folder containing `filename`.
## `uri`
the URI to select

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_action -->
Sets the type of operation that the chooser is performing; the
user interface is adapted to suit the selected action. For example,
an option to create a new folder might be shown if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Save` but not if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `action`
the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_choice -->
Selects an option in a 'choice' that has been added with
`FileChooser::add_choice`. For a boolean choice, the
possible options are "true" and "false".
## `id`
the ID of the choice to set
## `option`
the ID of the option to select
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_create_folders -->
Sets whether file choser will offer to create new folders.
This is only relevant if the action is not set to be
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `create_folders`
`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from a local filename.
The user will be shown the full contents of the current folder,
plus user interface elements for navigating to other folders.

In general, you should not use this function. See the
[section on setting up a file chooser dialog][gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up]
for the rationale behind this.
## `filename`
the full path of the new current folder

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder_file -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from a `gio::File`.
Internal function, see `FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri`.
## `file`
the `gio::File` for the new folder

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be changed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder_uri -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from an URI.
The user will be shown the full contents of the current folder,
plus user interface elements for navigating to other folders.

In general, you should not use this function. See the
[section on setting up a file chooser dialog][gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up]
for the rationale behind this.
## `uri`
the URI for the new current folder

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be changed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_name -->
Sets the current name in the file selector, as if entered
by the user. Note that the name passed in here is a UTF-8
string rather than a filename. This function is meant for
such uses as a suggested name in a “Save As...” dialog. You can
pass “Untitled.doc” or a similarly suitable suggestion for the `name`.

If you want to preselect a particular existing file, you should use
`FileChooser::set_filename` or `FileChooser::set_uri` instead.
Please see the documentation for those functions for an example of using
`FileChooser::set_current_name` as well.
## `name`
the filename to use, as a UTF-8 string
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Sets whether a file chooser in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode will present
a confirmation dialog if the user types a file name that already exists. This
is `false` by default.

If set to `true`, the `self` will emit the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal when appropriate.

If all you need is the standard confirmation dialog, set this property to `true`.
You can override the way confirmation is done by actually handling the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal; please refer to its documentation
for the details.
## `do_overwrite_confirmation`
whether to confirm overwriting in save mode
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_extra_widget -->
Sets an application-supplied widget to provide extra options to the user.
## `extra_widget`
widget for extra options
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_file -->
Sets `file` as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing
to the file’s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list. If
the `self` is in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the file’s base name
will also appear in the dialog’s file name entry.

If the file name isn’t in the current folder of `self`, then the current
folder of `self` will be changed to the folder containing `filename`. This
is equivalent to a sequence of `FileChooser::unselect_all` followed by
`FileChooser::select_filename`.

Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done except
for the directory change.

If you are implementing a save dialog,
you should use this function if you already have a file name to which the
user may save; for example, when the user opens an existing file and then
does Save As... If you don’t have
a file name already — for example, if the user just created a new
file and is saving it for the first time, do not call this function.
Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder_file (chooser, default_file_for_saving);
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file);
  }
```
## `file`
the `gio::File` to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_filename -->
Sets `filename` as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing to
the file’s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list; all other
files will be unselected. If the `self` is in
`FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the file’s base name will also appear in
the dialog’s file name entry.

Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done except
for the directory change.

You should use this function only when implementing a save
dialog for which you already have a file name to which
the user may save. For example, when the user opens an existing file and
then does Save As... to save a copy or
a modified version. If you don’t have a file name already — for
example, if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the first
time, do not call this function. Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser, existing_filename);
  }
```

In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestions
as to where to save his new file. In the second case, the file’s existing location
is already known, so the file chooser will use it.
## `filename`
the filename to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_filter -->
Sets the current filter; only the files that pass the
filter will be displayed. If the user-selectable list of filters
is non-empty, then the filter should be one of the filters
in that list. Setting the current filter when the list of
filters is empty is useful if you want to restrict the displayed
set of files without letting the user change it.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_local_only -->
Sets whether only local files can be selected in the
file selector. If `local_only` is `true` (the default is `false`),
then the selected file or files are guaranteed to be
accessible through the operating system’s native file
system and therefore the application only
needs to worry about the filename functions in
`FileChooser`, like `FileChooser::get_filename`,
rather than the URI functions like
`FileChooser::get_uri`,

On some systems non-native files may still be
available using the native filesystem via a userspace
filesystem (FUSE).
## `local_only`
`true` if only local files can be selected
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_preview_widget -->
Sets an application-supplied widget to use to display a custom preview
of the currently selected file. To implement a preview, after setting the
preview widget, you connect to the `FileChooser::update-preview`
signal, and call `FileChooser::get_preview_filename` or
`FileChooser::get_preview_uri` on each change. If you can
display a preview of the new file, update your widget and
set the preview active using `FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active`.
Otherwise, set the preview inactive.

When there is no application-supplied preview widget, or the
application-supplied preview widget is not active, the file chooser
will display no preview at all.
## `preview_widget`
widget for displaying preview.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_preview_widget_active -->
Sets whether the preview widget set by
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget` should be shown for the
current filename. When `active` is set to false, the file chooser
may display an internally generated preview of the current file
or it may display no preview at all. See
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget` for more details.
## `active`
whether to display the user-specified preview widget
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_select_multiple -->
Sets whether multiple files can be selected in the file selector. This is
only relevant if the action is set to be `FileChooserAction::Open` or
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.
## `select_multiple`
`true` if multiple files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_show_hidden -->
Sets whether hidden files and folders are displayed in the file selector.
## `show_hidden`
`true` if hidden files and folders should be displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_uri -->
Sets the file referred to by `uri` as the current file for the file chooser,
by changing to the URI’s parent folder and actually selecting the URI in the
list. If the `self` is `FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the URI’s base
name will also appear in the dialog’s file name entry.

Note that the URI must exist, or nothing will be done except for the
directory change.

You should use this function only when implementing a save
dialog for which you already have a file name to which
the user may save. For example, when the user opens an existing file and then
does Save As... to save a copy or a
modified version. If you don’t have a file name already — for example,
if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the first time, do
not call this function. Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
if (document_is_new)
  {
    // the user just created a new document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
  }
else
  {
    // the user edited an existing document
    gtk_file_chooser_set_uri (chooser, existing_uri);
  }
```


In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestions
as to where to save his new file. In the second case, the file’s existing location
is already known, so the file chooser will use it.
## `uri`
the URI to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_use_preview_label -->
Sets whether the file chooser should display a label with the name of
the file that is being previewed; the default is `true`. Applications that
want to draw the whole preview area themselves should set this to `false` and
display the name themselves in their preview widget.

See also: `FileChooser::set_preview_widget`
## `use_label`
whether to display a label with the name of the previewed file
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_all -->
Unselects all the files in the current folder of a file chooser.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_file -->
Unselects the file referred to by `file`. If the file is not in the current
directory, does not exist, or is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `file`
a `gio::File`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_filename -->
Unselects a currently selected filename. If the filename
is not in the current directory, does not exist, or
is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `filename`
the filename to unselect
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn unselect_uri -->
Unselects the file referred to by `uri`. If the file
is not in the current directory, does not exist, or
is otherwise not currently selected, does nothing.
## `uri`
the URI to unselect
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn connect_confirm_overwrite -->
This signal gets emitted whenever it is appropriate to present a
confirmation dialog when the user has selected a file name that
already exists. The signal only gets emitted when the file
chooser is in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode.

Most applications just need to turn on the
`FileChooser:do-overwrite-confirmation` property (or call the
`FileChooser::set_do_overwrite_confirmation` function), and
they will automatically get a standard confirmation dialog.
Applications which need to customize this behavior should do
that, and also connect to the `FileChooser::confirm-overwrite`
signal.

A signal handler for this signal must return a
`FileChooserConfirmation` value, which indicates the action to
take. If the handler determines that the user wants to select a
different filename, it should return
`FileChooserConfirmation::SelectAgain`. If it determines
that the user is satisfied with his choice of file name, it
should return `FileChooserConfirmation::AcceptFilename`.
On the other hand, if it determines that the standard confirmation
dialog should be used, it should return
`FileChooserConfirmation::Confirm`. The following example
illustrates this.

## Custom confirmation ## {`gtkfilechooser`-confirmation}


```C
static GtkFileChooserConfirmation
confirm_overwrite_callback (GtkFileChooser *chooser, gpointer data)
{
  char *uri;

  uri = gtk_file_chooser_get_uri (chooser);

  if (is_uri_read_only (uri))
    {
      if (user_wants_to_replace_read_only_file (uri))
        return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME;

# Returns

a `FileChooserConfirmation` value that indicates which
 action to take after emitting the signal.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn connect_current_folder_changed -->
This signal is emitted when the current folder in a `FileChooser`
changes. This can happen due to the user performing some action that
changes folders, such as selecting a bookmark or visiting a folder on the
file list. It can also happen as a result of calling a function to
explicitly change the current folder in a file chooser.

Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, unless you need to keep
track of which folder a file chooser is showing.

See also: `FileChooser::set_current_folder`,
`FileChooser::get_current_folder`,
`FileChooser::set_current_folder_uri`,
`FileChooser::get_current_folder_uri`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn connect_file_activated -->
This signal is emitted when the user "activates" a file in the file
chooser. This can happen by double-clicking on a file in the file list, or
by pressing `Enter`.

Normally you do not need to connect to this signal. It is used internally
by `FileChooserDialog` to know when to activate the default button in the
dialog.

See also: `FileChooser::get_filename`,
`FileChooser::get_filenames`, `FileChooser::get_uri`,
`FileChooser::get_uris`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn connect_selection_changed -->
This signal is emitted when there is a change in the set of selected files
in a `FileChooser`. This can happen when the user modifies the selection
with the mouse or the keyboard, or when explicitly calling functions to
change the selection.

Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, as it is easier to wait
for the file chooser to finish running, and then to get the list of
selected files using the functions mentioned below.

See also: `FileChooser::select_filename`,
`FileChooser::unselect_filename`, `FileChooser::get_filename`,
`FileChooser::get_filenames`, `FileChooser::select_uri`,
`FileChooser::unselect_uri`, `FileChooser::get_uri`,
`FileChooser::get_uris`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn connect_update_preview -->
This signal is emitted when the preview in a file chooser should be
regenerated. For example, this can happen when the currently selected file
changes. You should use this signal if you want your file chooser to have
a preview widget.

Once you have installed a preview widget with
`FileChooser::set_preview_widget`, you should update it when this
signal is emitted. You can use the functions
`FileChooser::get_preview_filename` or
`FileChooser::get_preview_uri` to get the name of the file to preview.
Your widget may not be able to preview all kinds of files; your callback
must call `FileChooser::set_preview_widget_active` to inform the file
chooser about whether the preview was generated successfully or not.

Please see the example code in
[Using a Preview Widget][gtkfilechooser-preview].

will offer the user to create new folders.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_property_create_folders -->
Whether a file chooser not in `FileChooserAction::Open` mode

<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_property_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Whether a file chooser in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode
will present an overwrite confirmation dialog if the user
selects a file name that already exists.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_property_do_overwrite_confirmation -->
Whether a file chooser in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode

<!-- enum FileChooserAction -->
Describes whether a `FileChooser` is being used to open existing files
or to save to a possibly new file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Open -->
Indicates open mode. The file chooser
 will only let the user pick an existing file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Save -->
Indicates save mode. The file chooser
 will let the user pick an existing file, or type in a new
 filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant SelectFolder -->
Indicates an Open mode for
 selecting folders. The file chooser will let the user pick an
 existing folder.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant CreateFolder -->
Indicates a mode for creating a
 new folder. The file chooser will let the user name an existing or
 new folder.
<!-- struct FileChooserButton -->
The `FileChooserButton` is a widget that lets the user select a
file. It implements the `FileChooser` interface. Visually, it is a
file name with a button to bring up a `FileChooserDialog`.
The user can then use that dialog to change the file associated with
that button. This widget does not support setting the
`FileChooser:select-multiple` property to `true`.

## Create a button to let the user select a file in /etc


```C
{
  GtkWidget *button;

  button = gtk_file_chooser_button_new (_("Select a file"),
                                        GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN);
  gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder (GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (button),
                                       "/etc");
}
```

The `FileChooserButton` supports the ``GtkFileChooserActions``
`FileChooserAction::Open` and `FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.

> The `FileChooserButton` will ellipsize the label, and will thus
> request little horizontal space. To give the button more space,
> you should call `WidgetExt::get_preferred_size`,

The width of the entry and label inside the button, in characters.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation -->
Used as a return value of handlers for the
`FileChooser::confirm-overwrite` signal of a `FileChooser`. This
value determines whether the file chooser will present the stock
confirmation dialog, accept the user’s choice of a filename, or
let the user choose another filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant Confirm -->
The file chooser will present
 its stock dialog to confirm about overwriting an existing file.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant AcceptFilename -->
The file chooser will
 terminate and accept the user’s choice of a file name.
<!-- enum FileChooserConfirmation::variant SelectAgain -->
The file chooser will
 continue running, so as to let the user select another file name.
<!-- struct FileChooserDialog -->
`FileChooserDialog` is a dialog box suitable for use with
“File/Open” or “File/Save as” commands. This widget works by
putting a `FileChooserWidget` inside a `Dialog`. It exposes
the `FileChooser` interface, so you can use all of the
`FileChooser` functions on the file chooser dialog as well as
those for `Dialog`.

Note that `FileChooserDialog` does not have any methods of its
own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
`FileChooser`.

If you want to integrate well with the platform you should use the
`FileChooserNative` API, which will use a platform-specific
dialog if available and fall back to `FileChooserDialog`
otherwise.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkfilechooser`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`FileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
gint res;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Open"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);

res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;
    GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    open_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooser *chooser;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
gint res;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Save"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);
chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation (chooser, TRUE);

if (user_edited_a_new_document)
  gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser,
                                     _("Untitled document"));
else
  gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser,
                                 existing_filename);

res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;

    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    save_to_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-setting-up}

There are various cases in which you may need to use a `FileChooserDialog`:

- To select a file for opening. Use `FileChooserAction::Open`.

- To save a file for the first time. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with `FileChooser::set_current_name`.

- To save a file under a different name. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and set the existing filename with `FileChooser::set_filename`.

- To choose a folder instead of a file. Use `FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.

Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
using `FileChooser::set_current_folder` in various
situations, with the intention of letting the application
suggest a reasonable default folder. This is no longer
considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
able to make good suggestions on its own. In general, you
should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
when it is appropriate to use `FileChooser::set_filename`,
i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
have a file saved somewhere.

## Response Codes ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-responses}

`FileChooserDialog` inherits from `Dialog`, so buttons that
go in its action area have response codes such as
`ResponseType::Accept` and `ResponseType::Cancel`. For example, you
could call `FileChooserDialog::new` as follows:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Open"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);
```

This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use predefined
response identifiers from `ResponseType`. For most dialog
boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
ones in `ResponseType`, but `FileChooserDialog` assumes that
its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
will have one of the following response codes:

- `ResponseType::Accept`
- `ResponseType::Ok`
- `ResponseType::Yes`
- `ResponseType::Apply`

This is because `FileChooserDialog` must intercept responses
and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
appropriate.

To summarize, make sure you use a
[predefined response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
when you use `FileChooserDialog` to ensure proper operation.

`Dialog::new_with_buttons`.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`
## `action`
Open or save mode for the dialog
## `first_button_text`

<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant BadFilename -->
Indicates a malformed filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant AlreadyExists -->

Indicates an incomplete hostname (e.g. "http://foo" without a slash after that).
<!-- struct FileChooserNative -->
`FileChooserNative` is an abstraction of a dialog box suitable
for use with “File/Open” or “File/Save as” commands. By default, this
just uses a `FileChooserDialog` to implement the actual dialog.
However, on certain platforms, such as Windows and macOS, the native platform
file chooser is used instead. When the application is running in a
sandboxed environment without direct filesystem access (such as Flatpak),
`FileChooserNative` may call the proper APIs (portals) to let the user
choose a file and make it available to the application.

While the API of `FileChooserNative` closely mirrors `FileChooserDialog`, the main
difference is that there is no access to any `Window` or `Widget` for the dialog.
This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a platform native dialog.
Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the `NativeDialog` functions.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkfilechoosernative`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`FileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:


```text
GtkFileChooserNative *native;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
gint res;

native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      "_Open",
                                      "_Cancel");

res = gtk_native_dialog_run (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;
    GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    open_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

g_object_unref (native);
```

To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:


```text
GtkFileChooserNative *native;
GtkFileChooser *chooser;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
gint res;

native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      "_Save",
                                      "_Cancel");
chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);

gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation (chooser, TRUE);

if (user_edited_a_new_document)
  gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser,
                                     _("Untitled document"));
else
  gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser,
                                 existing_filename);

res = gtk_native_dialog_run (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
  {
    char *filename;

    filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
    save_to_file (filename);
    g_free (filename);
  }

g_object_unref (native);
```

For more information on how to best set up a file dialog, see `FileChooserDialog`.

## Response Codes ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-responses}

`FileChooserNative` inherits from `NativeDialog`, which means it
will return `ResponseType::Accept` if the user accepted, and
`ResponseType::Cancel` if he pressed cancel. It can also return
`ResponseType::DeleteEvent` if the window was unexpectedly closed.

## Differences from `FileChooserDialog` ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-differences}

There are a few things in the `FileChooser` API that are not
possible to use with `FileChooserNative`, as such use would
prohibit the use of a native dialog.

There is no support for the signals that are emitted when the user
navigates in the dialog, including:
* `FileChooser::current-folder-changed`
* `FileChooser::selection-changed`
* `FileChooser::file-activated`
* `FileChooser::confirm-overwrite`

You can also not use the methods that directly control user navigation:
* `FileChooser::unselect_filename`
* `FileChooser::select_all`
* `FileChooser::unselect_all`

If you need any of the above you will have to use `FileChooserDialog` directly.

No operations that change the the dialog work while the dialog is
visible. Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.

## Win32 details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-win32}

On windows the IFileDialog implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
used. It supports many of the features that `FileChooserDialog`
does, but there are some things it does not handle:

* Extra widgets added with `FileChooser::set_extra_widget`.

* Use of custom previews by connecting to `FileChooser::update-preview`.

* Any `FileFilter` added using a mimetype or custom filter.

If any of these features are used the regular `FileChooserDialog`
will be used in place of the native one.

## Portal details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-portal}

When the org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser portal is available on the
session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser. Depending
on the kind of session the application is running in, this may or may not
be a GTK+ file chooser. In this situation, the following things are not
supported and will be silently ignored:

* Extra widgets added with `FileChooser::set_extra_widget`.

* Use of custom previews by connecting to `FileChooser::update-preview`.

* Any `FileFilter` added with a custom filter.

## macOS details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-macos}

On macOS the NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel classes are used to provide native
file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by `FileChooserDialog` are
not supported:

* Extra widgets added with `FileChooser::set_extra_widget`, unless the
 widget is an instance of `Label`, in which case the label text will be used
 to set the NSSavePanel message instance property.

* Use of custom previews by connecting to `FileChooser::update-preview`.

* Any `FileFilter` added with a custom filter.

* Shortcut folders.

<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt -->
Trait containing all `FileChooserWidget` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserWidget`](struct.FileChooserWidget.html)
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileChooserWidget`. This is a file chooser widget that can
be embedded in custom windows, and it is the same widget that is used by
`FileChooserDialog`.
## `action`
Open or save mode for the widget

# Returns

a new `FileChooserWidget`
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_desktop_folder -->
The ::desktop-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the user's Desktop
folder in the file list.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + D`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_down_folder -->
The ::down-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the current folder
in the file hierarchy. The subfolder that will be used is displayed in the
path bar widget of the file chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing
"/foo/bar/baz", with bar currently displayed, then this will cause the file
chooser to switch to the "baz" subfolder.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Down`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_home_folder -->
The ::home-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the user's home
folder in the file list.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Home`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_location_popup -->
The ::location-popup signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" prompt which
the user can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select.

The default bindings for this signal are `Control + L` with a `path` string
of "" (the empty string). It is also bound to `/` with a `path` string of
"`/`" (a slash): this lets you type `/` and immediately type a path name.
On Unix systems, this is bound to `~` (tilde) with a `path` string of "~"
itself for access to home directories.
## `path`
a string that gets put in the text entry for the file name
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_location_popup_on_paste -->
The ::location-popup-on-paste signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" prompt when the user
pastes into a `FileChooserWidget`.

The default binding for this signal is `Control + V`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_location_toggle_popup -->
The ::location-toggle-popup signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to toggle the visibility of a "Location" prompt which the user
can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select.

The default binding for this signal is `Control + L`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_places_shortcut -->
The ::places-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to move the focus to the places sidebar.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + P`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_quick_bookmark -->
The ::quick-bookmark signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser switch to the bookmark specified
in the `bookmark_index` parameter. For example, if you have three bookmarks,
you can pass 0, 1, 2 to this signal to switch to each of them, respectively.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + 1`, `Alt + 2`,
etc. until `Alt + 0`. Note that in the default binding, that
`Alt + 1` is actually defined to switch to the bookmark at index
0, and so on successively; `Alt + 0` is defined to switch to the
bookmark at index 10.
## `bookmark_index`
the number of the bookmark to switch to
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_recent_shortcut -->
The ::recent-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the Recent location.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + R`.
<!-- trait FileChooserWidgetExt::fn connect_search_shortcut -->
The ::search-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the search entry.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + S`.

which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser go to the parent of the current folder
in the file hierarchy.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Up`.
<!-- struct FileFilter -->
A `FileFilter` can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
`FileChooser`. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
`FileFilter::add_pattern`), on their mime type (with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`), or by a custom filter function
(with `FileFilter::add_custom`).

Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
text/plain. Note that `FileFilter` allows wildcards for the
subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.

Normally, filters are used by adding them to a `FileChooser`,
see `FileChooser::add_filter`, but it is also possible
to manually use a filter on a file with `FileFilter::filter`.

# `FileFilter` as `Buildable`

The `FileFilter` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>`, `<patterns>` and
`<applications>` elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
a `<mime-type>` or `<pattern>` has the same effect as as calling
`FileFilter::add_mime_type` or `FileFilter::add_pattern`.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying `FileFilter`
rules:

```text
<object class="GtkFileFilter">
  <mime-types>
    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
    <mime-type>image/ *</mime-type>
  </mime-types>
  <patterns>
    <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
    <pattern>*.png</pattern>
  </patterns>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileFilter` with no rules added to it.
Such a filter doesn’t accept any files, so is not
particularly useful until you add rules with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`, `FileFilter::add_pattern`,
or `FileFilter::add_custom`. To create a filter
that accepts any file, use:

```C
GtkFileFilter *filter = gtk_file_filter_new ();
gtk_file_filter_add_pattern (filter, "*");
```

# Returns

a new `FileFilter`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn new_from_gvariant -->
Deserialize a file filter from an a{sv} variant in
the format produced by `FileFilter::to_gvariant`.
## `variant`
an a{sv} `glib::Variant`

# Returns

a new `FileFilter` object
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_custom -->
Adds rule to a filter that allows files based on a custom callback
function. The bitfield `needed` which is passed in provides information
about what sorts of information that the filter function needs;
this allows GTK+ to avoid retrieving expensive information when
it isn’t needed by the filter.
## `needed`
bitfield of flags indicating the information that the custom
 filter function needs.
## `func`
callback function; if the function returns `true`, then
 the file will be displayed.
## `data`
data to pass to `func`
## `notify`
function to call to free `data` when it is no longer needed.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_mime_type -->
Adds a rule allowing a given mime type to `self`.
## `mime_type`
name of a MIME type
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pattern -->
Adds a rule allowing a shell style glob to a filter.
## `pattern`
a shell style glob
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pixbuf_formats -->
Adds a rule allowing image files in the formats supported
by `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn filter -->
Tests whether a file should be displayed according to `self`.
The `FileFilterInfo` `filter_info` should include
the fields returned from `FileFilter::get_needed`.

This function will not typically be used by applications; it
is intended principally for use in the implementation of
`FileChooser`.
## `filter_info`
a `FileFilterInfo` containing information
 about a file.

# Returns

`true` if the file should be displayed
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_name -->
Gets the human-readable name for the filter. See `FileFilter::set_name`.

# Returns

The human-readable name of the filter,
 or `None`. This value is owned by GTK+ and must not
 be modified or freed.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_needed -->
Gets the fields that need to be filled in for the `FileFilterInfo`
passed to `FileFilter::filter`

This function will not typically be used by applications; it
is intended principally for use in the implementation of
`FileChooser`.

# Returns

bitfield of flags indicating needed fields when
 calling `FileFilter::filter`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn set_name -->
Sets the human-readable name of the filter; this is the string
that will be displayed in the file selector user interface if
there is a selectable list of filters.
## `name`
the human-readable-name for the filter, or `None`
 to remove any existing name.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn to_gvariant -->
Serialize a file filter to an a{sv} variant.

# Returns

a new, floating, `glib::Variant`
<!-- struct FileFilterInfo -->
A `FileFilterInfo`-struct is used to pass information about the
tested file to `FileFilter::filter`.
<!-- struct FilterListModel -->
`FilterListModel` is a list model that filters a given other
listmodel.
It hides some elements from the other model according to
criteria given by a ``GtkFilterListModelFilterFunc``.

# Implements

## `user_destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`

# Returns

a new `FilterListModel`
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn new_for_type -->

Sets the function used to filter items. The function will be called for every
item and if it returns `true` the item is considered visible.
## `filter_func`
filter function or `None` to not filter items
## `user_data`
user data passed to `filter_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait FilterListModelExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model to be filtered.

Note that GTK makes no effort to ensure that `model` conforms to
the item type of `self`. It assumes that the caller knows what they
are doing and have set up an appropriate filter function to ensure
that item types match.

The model to be filtered
<!-- trait FilterListModelExt::fn get_property_has_filter -->
If a filter is set for this model

<!-- struct Fixed -->
The `Fixed` widget is a container which can place child widgets
at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. `Fixed`
performs no automatic layout management.

For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
results in broken applications. With `Fixed`, the following
things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
other display bugs:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 cases.

In addition, `Fixed` does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order containers
appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
thing they label when using an RTL language, but it can’t do that with
`Fixed`. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
application.

If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
and prefer the simplicity of `Fixed`, by all means use the
widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.

## `widget`
a child of `self`
## `x`
the horizontal position of the `widget`
## `y`
the vertical position of the `widget`
<!-- trait FixedExt::fn get_child_transform -->
Retrieves the transformation for `widget` set using

<!-- trait FixedExt::fn move -->
Sets a translation transformation to the given `x` and `y` coordinates to

## `widget`
the child widget.
## `x`
the horizontal position to move the widget to.

<!-- trait FixedExt::fn set_child_transform -->
Sets the transformation for `widget`.

This is a convenience function that retrieves the `FixedLayoutChild`
instance associated to `widget` and calls `FixedLayoutChildExt::set_position`.
## `widget`
a `Widget`, child of `self`
## `transform`
the transformation assigned to `widget`
<!-- struct FixedLayout -->
`FixedLayout` is a layout manager which can place child widgets
at fixed positions, and with fixed sizes.

Most applications should never use this layout manager; fixed positioning
and sizing requires constant recalculations on where children need to be
positioned and sized. Other layout managers perform this kind of work
internally so that application developers don't need to do it. Specifically,
widgets positioned in a fixed layout manager will need to take into account:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different
 fonts.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 cases.

In addition, `FixedLayout` does not pay attention to text direction and
thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
containers appropriately depending on the text direction, e.g. to put labels
to the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language;
`FixedLayout` won't be able to do that for you.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove GUI
elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This is a
long-term maintenance problem for your application.

<!-- struct FlattenListModel -->
`FlattenListModel` is a list model that takes a list model containing
list models and flattens it into a single model.

Another term for this is concatenation: `FlattenListModel` takes a
list of lists and concatenates them into a single list.

<!-- struct FlowBox -->
A `FlowBox` positions child widgets in sequence according to its
orientation.

For instance, with the horizontal orientation, the widgets will be
arranged from left to right, starting a new row under the previous
row when necessary. Reducing the width in this case will require more
rows, so a larger height will be requested.

Likewise, with the vertical orientation, the widgets will be arranged
from top to bottom, starting a new column to the right when necessary.
Reducing the height will require more columns, so a larger width will
be requested.

The size request of a `FlowBox` alone may not be what you expect; if you
need to be able to shrink it along both axes and dynamically reflow its
children, you may have to wrap it in a `ScrolledWindow` to enable that.

The children of a `FlowBox` can be dynamically sorted and filtered.

Although a `FlowBox` must have only `FlowBoxChild` children,
you can add any kind of widget to it via `ContainerExt::add`, and
a `FlowBoxChild` widget will automatically be inserted between
the box and the widget.

Also see `ListBox`.

`FlowBox` was added in GTK+ 3.12.

# CSS nodes


```plain
flowbox
├── flowboxchild
│   ╰── <child>
├── flowboxchild
│   ╰── <child>
┊
╰── [rubberband]
```

`FlowBox` uses a single CSS node with name flowbox. `FlowBoxChild`
uses a single CSS node with name flowboxchild.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn bind_model -->
Binds `model` to `self`.

If `self` was already bound to a model, that previous binding is
destroyed.

The contents of `self` are cleared and then filled with widgets that
represent items from `model`. `self` is updated whenever `model` changes.
If `model` is `None`, `self` is left empty.

It is undefined to add or remove widgets directly (for example, with
`FlowBoxExt::insert` or `ContainerExt::add`) while `self` is bound to a
model.

Note that using a model is incompatible with the filtering and sorting
functionality in `FlowBox`. When using a model, filtering and sorting
should be implemented by the model.
## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to be bound to `self`
## `create_widget_func`
a function that creates widgets for items
## `user_data`
user data passed to `create_widget_func`

the `SelectionMode`
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn insert -->
Inserts the `widget` into `self` at `position`.

If a sort function is set, the widget will actually be inserted
at the calculated position and this function has the same effect
as `ContainerExt::add`.

If `position` is -1, or larger than the total number of children
in the `self`, then the `widget` will be appended to the end.
## `widget`
the `Widget` to add
## `position`
the position to insert `child` in
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn invalidate_filter -->
Updates the filtering for all children.

Call this function when the result of the filter
function on the `self` is changed due ot an external
factor. For instance, this would be used if the
filter function just looked for a specific search
term, and the entry with the string has changed.
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn invalidate_sort -->
Updates the sorting for all children.

Call this when the result of the sort function on
`self` is changed due to an external factor.
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn select_all -->
Select all children of `self`, if the selection
mode allows it.
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn select_child -->
Selects a single child of `self`, if the selection
mode allows it.

the spacing to use
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_filter_func -->
By setting a filter function on the `self` one can decide dynamically
which of the children to show. For instance, to implement a search
function that only shows the children matching the search terms.

The `filter_func` will be called for each child after the call, and
it will continue to be called each time a child changes (via
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed`) or when `FlowBoxExt::invalidate_filter`
is called.

Note that using a filter function is incompatible with using a model
(see `FlowBoxExt::bind_model`).
## `filter_func`
callback that
 lets you filter which children to show
## `user_data`
user data passed to `filter_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_hadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in `self`.
The adjustment is also used for autoscrolling during
rubberband selection. See `ScrolledWindowExt::get_hadjustment`
for a typical way of obtaining the adjustment, and
`FlowBoxExt::set_vadjustment`for setting the vertical
adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same

Sets the `FlowBox:homogeneous` property of `self`, controlling
whether or not all children of `self` are given equal space
in the box.
## `homogeneous`
`true` to create equal allotments,
 `false` for variable allotments
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_max_children_per_line -->
Sets the maximum number of children to request and
allocate space for in `self`’s orientation.

Setting the maximum number of children per line
limits the overall natural size request to be no more
than `n_children` children long in the given orientation.
## `n_children`
the maximum number of children per line
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_min_children_per_line -->
Sets the minimum number of children to line up
in `self`’s orientation before flowing.

the new selection mode
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_sort_func -->
By setting a sort function on the `self`, one can dynamically
reorder the children of the box, based on the contents of
the children.

The `sort_func` will be called for each child after the call,
and will continue to be called each time a child changes (via
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed`) and when `FlowBoxExt::invalidate_sort`
is called.

Note that using a sort function is incompatible with using a model
(see `FlowBoxExt::bind_model`).
## `sort_func`
the sort function
## `user_data`
user data passed to `sort_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn set_vadjustment -->
Hooks up an adjustment to focus handling in `self`.
The adjustment is also used for autoscrolling during
rubberband selection. See `ScrolledWindowExt::get_vadjustment`
for a typical way of obtaining the adjustment, and
`FlowBoxExt::set_hadjustment`for setting the horizontal
adjustment.

The adjustments have to be in pixel units and in the same
coordinate system as the allocation for immediate children
of the box.
## `adjustment`
an adjustment which should be adjusted
 when the focus is moved among the descendents of `container`
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn unselect_all -->
Unselect all children of `self`, if the selection
mode allows it.

The ::child-activated signal is emitted when a child has been
activated by the user.
## `child`
the child that is activated
<!-- trait FlowBoxExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifer does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual children
- Home/End keys move to the ends of the box
- PageUp/PageDown keys move vertically by pages
## `step`
the granularity fo the move, as a `MovementStep`
## `count`
the number of `step` units to move

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
`false` to propagate the event further.

<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt -->
Trait containing all `FlowBoxChild` methods.

# Implementors

[`FlowBoxChild`](struct.FlowBoxChild.html)
<!-- impl FlowBoxChild::fn new -->
Creates a new `FlowBoxChild`, to be used as a child
of a `FlowBox`.

# Returns

a new `FlowBoxChild`
<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting and filtering.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the sorting and filtering functions. For instance, if
the list is mirroring some external data set, and *two* children
changed in the external data set when you call
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed` on the first child, the sort function
must only read the new data for the first of the two changed
children, otherwise the resorting of the children will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model, you have to duplicate the data that affects the sorting
and filtering functions into the widgets themselves. Another
alternative is to call `FlowBoxExt::invalidate_sort` on any
model change, but that is more expensive.
<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn get_index -->
Gets the current index of the `self` in its `FlowBox` container.

# Returns

the index of the `self`, or -1 if the `self` is not
 in a flow box.

<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal is emitted when the user activates
a child widget in a `FlowBox`, either by clicking or
double-clicking, or by using the Space or Enter key.

While this signal is used as a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`],
it can be used by applications for their own purposes.
<!-- struct FontButton -->

To set the font which is initially selected, use
`FontChooser::set_font` or `FontChooser::set_font_desc`.

To get the selected font use `FontChooser::get_font` or
`FontChooser::get_font_desc`.

To change the text which is shown in the preview area, use
`FontChooser::set_preview_text`.

# CSS nodes

`FontChooserWidget` has a single CSS node with name fontchooser.

<!-- trait FontChooserWidgetExt::fn get_property_tweak_action -->
A toggle action that can be used to switch to the tweak page
of the font chooser widget, which lets the user tweak the
OpenType features and variation axes of the selected font.

The action will be enabled or disabled depending on whether
the selected font has any features or axes.
<!-- struct Frame -->
The frame widget is a bin that surrounds its child with a decorative
frame and an optional label. If present, the label is drawn inside
the top edge of the frame. The horizontal position of the label can
be controlled with `FrameExt::set_label_align`.

# `Frame` as `Buildable`

The `Frame` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can
be specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Frame`:

```plain
frame[.flat]
├── <label widget>
╰── <child>
```

`Frame` has a main CSS node with name “frame”, which is used to draw the
visible border. You can set the appearance of the border using CSS properties
like “border-style” on this node.

The node can be given the style class “.flat”, which is used by themes to
disable drawing of the border. To do this from code, call
`FrameExt::set_shadow_type` with `ShadowType::None` to add the “.flat” class or
any other shadow type to remove it.

<!-- trait FrameExt::fn set_label_align -->
Sets the X alignment of the frame widget’s label. The
default value for a newly created frame is 0.0.
## `xalign`
The position of the label along the top edge
 of the widget. A value of 0.0 represents left alignment;
 1.0 represents right alignment.
<!-- trait FrameExt::fn set_label_widget -->
Sets the `Frame:label-widget` for the frame. This is the widget that
will appear embedded in the top edge of the frame as a title.
## `label_widget`
the new label widget
<!-- trait FrameExt::fn set_shadow_type -->
Sets the `Frame:shadow-type` for `self`, i.e. whether it is drawn without
(`ShadowType::None`) or with (other values) a visible border. Values other than
`ShadowType::None` are treated identically by `Frame`. The chosen type is
applied by removing or adding the .flat class to the main CSS node, frame.
## `type_`
the new `ShadowType`
<!-- struct GLArea -->
`GLArea` is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL.

`GLArea` sets up its own `gdk::GLContext` for the window it creates, and
creates a custom GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto.
It also ensures that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target
when rendering.

In order to draw, you have to connect to the `GLArea::render` signal,
or subclass `GLArea` and override the `GLAreaClass.render`() virtual
function.

The `GLArea` widget ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` is associated with
the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
position of the drawing area changes.

## Drawing with `GLArea` ##

The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a `GLArea` is to
create a widget instance and connect to the `GLArea::render` signal:


```C

```

The `render()` function will be called when the `GLArea` is ready
for you to draw its content:


```C
  static gboolean
  render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
  {
    // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
    // #GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
    // surface used by the #GtkGLArea and the viewport has
    // already been set to be the size of the allocation

    // we can start by clearing the buffer
    glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
    glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // draw your object
    // draw_an_object ();

    // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
    // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
    // the buffers will be drawn on the window
    return TRUE;
  }

  void setup_glarea (void)
  {
    // create a GtkGLArea instance
    GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();

    // connect to the "render" signal
    g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
  }
```

If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
shaders, you should use the `Widget::realize` signal; you
can use the `Widget::unrealize` signal to clean up. Since the
`gdk::GLContext` creation and initialization may fail, you will
need to check for errors, using `GLAreaExt::get_error`. An example
of how to safely initialize the GL state is:


```C
  static void
  on_realize (GtkGLarea *area)
  {
    // We need to make the context current if we want to
    // call GL API
    gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);

    // If there were errors during the initialization or
    // when trying to make the context current, this
    // function will return a #GError for you to catch
    if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
      return;

    // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order
    // to show eventual initialization errors on the
    // GtkGLArea widget itself
    GError *internal_error = NULL;
    init_buffer_objects (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }

    init_shaders (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }
  }
```

If you need to change the options for creating the `gdk::GLContext`
you should use the `GLArea::create-context` signal.

are created and bound to the frambuffer.

This function is automatically called before emitting the
`GLArea::render` signal, and doesn't normally need to be called
by application code.

<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_use_es -->
Retrieves the value set by `GLAreaExt::set_use_es`.

# Returns

`true` if the `GLArea` should create an OpenGL ES context
 and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn make_current -->
Ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` used by `self` is associated with
the `GLArea`.

This function is automatically called before emitting the
`GLArea::render` signal, and doesn't normally need to be called
by application code.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn queue_render -->
Marks the currently rendered data (if any) as invalid, and queues
a redraw of the widget, ensuring that the `GLArea::render` signal
is emitted during the draw.

This is only needed when the `GLAreaExt::set_auto_render` has
been called with a `false` value. The default behaviour is to
emit `GLArea::render` on each draw.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_auto_render -->
If `auto_render` is `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be
emitted every time the widget draws. This is the default and is
useful if drawing the widget is faster.

If `auto_render` is `false` the data from previous rendering is kept
around and will be used for drawing the widget the next time,
unless the window is resized. In order to force a rendering
`GLAreaExt::queue_render` must be called. This mode is useful when
the scene changes seldomly, but takes a long time to redraw.
## `auto_render`
a boolean
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_error -->
Sets an error on the area which will be shown instead of the
GL rendering. This is useful in the `GLArea::create-context`
signal if GL context creation fails.
## `error`
a new `glib::Error`, or `None` to unset the error
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_has_depth_buffer -->
If `has_depth_buffer` is `true` the widget will allocate and
enable a depth buffer for the target framebuffer. Otherwise
there will be none.
## `has_depth_buffer`
`true` to add a depth buffer
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_has_stencil_buffer -->
If `has_stencil_buffer` is `true` the widget will allocate and
enable a stencil buffer for the target framebuffer. Otherwise
there will be none.
## `has_stencil_buffer`
`true` to add a stencil buffer
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_required_version -->
Sets the required version of OpenGL to be used when creating the context
for the widget.

This function must be called before the area has been realized.
## `major`
the major version
## `minor`
the minor version
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_use_es -->
Sets whether the `self` should create an OpenGL or an OpenGL ES context.

You should check the capabilities of the `gdk::GLContext` before drawing
with either API.
## `use_es`
whether to use OpenGL or OpenGL ES
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_create_context -->
The ::create-context signal is emitted when the widget is being
realized, and allows you to override how the GL context is
created. This is useful when you want to reuse an existing GL
context, or if you want to try creating different kinds of GL
options.

If context creation fails then the signal handler can use
`GLAreaExt::set_error` to register a more detailed error
of how the construction failed.

# Returns

a newly created `gdk::GLContext`;
 the `GLArea` widget will take ownership of the returned value.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_render -->
The ::render signal is emitted every time the contents
of the `GLArea` should be redrawn.

The `context` is bound to the `area` prior to emitting this function,
and the buffers are painted to the window once the emission terminates.
## `context`
the `gdk::GLContext` used by `area`

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
 `false` to propagate the event further.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_resize -->
The ::resize signal is emitted once when the widget is realized, and
then each time the widget is changed while realized. This is useful
in order to keep GL state up to date with the widget size, like for
instance camera properties which may depend on the width/height ratio.

The GL context for the area is guaranteed to be current when this signal
is emitted.

The default handler sets up the GL viewport.
## `width`
the width of the viewport
## `height`
the height of the viewport
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_auto_render -->
If set to `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be emitted every time
the widget draws. This is the default and is useful if drawing the widget
is faster.

If set to `false` the data from previous rendering is kept around and will
be used for drawing the widget the next time, unless the window is resized.
In order to force a rendering `GLAreaExt::queue_render` must be called.
This mode is useful when the scene changes seldomly, but takes a long time
to redraw.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_auto_render -->
If set to `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be emitted every time
the widget draws. This is the default and is useful if drawing the widget
is faster.

be used for drawing the widget the next time, unless the window is resized.
In order to force a rendering `GLAreaExt::queue_render` must be called.
This mode is useful when the scene changes seldomly, but takes a long time
to redraw.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_context -->
The `gdk::GLContext` used by the `GLArea` widget.

The `GLArea` widget is responsible for creating the `gdk::GLContext`
instance. If you need to render with other kinds of buffers (stencil,
depth, etc), use render buffers.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_has_depth_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a depth buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_has_depth_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a depth buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_has_stencil_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a stencil buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_has_stencil_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a stencil buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_use_es -->
If set to `true` the widget will try to create a `gdk::GLContext` using
OpenGL ES instead of OpenGL.

See also: `gdk::GLContext::set_use_es`
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_use_es -->
If set to `true` the widget will try to create a `gdk::GLContext` using
OpenGL ES instead of OpenGL.

<!-- struct Gesture -->
`Gesture` is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
the special `None` `gdk::EventSequence` value for these).

The number of touches that a `Gesture` need to be recognized is controlled
by the `Gesture:n-points` property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
is recognized.

As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
run the `Gesture::check` signal regularly on input events until the gesture
is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
`Gesture` subclasses.

A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
- `Gesture::begin` when the gesture is recognized.
- A number of `Gesture::update`, whenever an input event is processed.
- `Gesture::end` when the gesture is no longer recognized.

## Event propagation

In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
through `EventControllerExt::set_propagation_phase`, or feed those manually
through `EventControllerExt::handle_event`.

In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.

After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional `Widget::event` signal.
Gestures with the `PropagationPhase::Target` phase are fed events from the default
`Widget::event` handlers.

In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.

## States of a sequence # {`touch`-sequence-states}

Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
``GtkGestures``, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the ``GdkEventSequences``
triggering those.

Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through `GestureExt::group`,
grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
`GestureExt::set_sequence_state` on one will effectively propagate
the state throughout the group.

By default, all sequences start out in the `EventSequenceState::None` state,
sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.

If a sequence enters into the `EventSequenceState::Denied` state, the gesture
group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
the touch is active.

If a sequence enters in the `EventSequenceState::Claimed` state, the gesture
group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
- Setting the same sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied` on every other gesture
 group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
 chain.
- calling `Gesture::cancel` on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
 propagation chain.
- Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.

Note: if a sequence is set early to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on
`gdk::EventType::TouchBegin`/`gdk::EventType::ButtonPress` (so those events are captured before
reaching the event widget, this implies `PropagationPhase::Capture`), one similar
event will emulated if the sequence changes to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.
This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
again.

Sequence states can't be changed freely, see `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`
to know about the possible lifetimes of a `gdk::EventSequence`.

## Touchpad gestures

On the platforms that support it, `Gesture` will handle transparently
touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of `Gesture` should do
to enable this support are:
- Enabling `gdk::EventMask::TouchpadGestureMask` on their ``GdkSurfaces``
- If the gesture has `PropagationPhase::None`, ensuring events of type
 `gdk::EventType::TouchpadSwipe` and `gdk::EventType::TouchpadPinch` are handled by the `Gesture`

# Implements

<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_bounding_box -->
If there are touch sequences being currently handled by `self`,
this function returns `true` and fills in `rect` with the bounding
box containing all active touches. Otherwise, `false` will be
returned.

Note: This function will yield unexpected results on touchpad
gestures. Since there is no correlation between physical and
pixel distances, these will look as if constrained in an
infinitely small area, `rect` width and height will thus be 0
regardless of the number of touchpoints.
## `rect`
bounding box containing all active touches.

# Returns

`true` if there are active touches, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_bounding_box_center -->
If there are touch sequences being currently handled by `self`,
this function returns `true` and fills in `x` and `y` with the center
of the bounding box containing all active touches. Otherwise, `false`
will be returned.
## `x`
X coordinate for the bounding box center
## `y`
Y coordinate for the bounding box center

# Returns

`false` if no active touches are present, `true` otherwise
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_device -->
Returns the master `gdk::Device` that is currently operating
on `self`, or `None` if the gesture is not being interacted.

# Returns

a `gdk::Device`, or `None`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_group -->
Returns all gestures in the group of `self`

# Returns

The list
 of ``GtkGestures``, free with `glib::List::free`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_last_event -->
Returns the last event that was processed for `sequence`.

Note that the returned pointer is only valid as long as the `sequence`
is still interpreted by the `self`. If in doubt, you should make
a copy of the event.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`

# Returns

The last event from `sequence`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_last_updated_sequence -->
Returns the `gdk::EventSequence` that was last updated on `self`.

# Returns

The last updated sequence
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_point -->
If `sequence` is currently being interpreted by `self`, this
function returns `true` and fills in `x` and `y` with the last coordinates
stored for that event sequence. The coordinates are always relative to the
widget allocation.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`, or `None` for pointer events
## `x`
return location for X axis of the sequence coordinates
## `y`
return location for Y axis of the sequence coordinates

# Returns

`true` if `sequence` is currently interpreted
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_sequence_state -->
Returns the `sequence` state, as seen by `self`.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`

# Returns

The sequence state in `self`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_sequences -->
Returns the list of ``GdkEventSequences`` currently being interpreted
by `self`.

# Returns

A list
 of ``GdkEventSequences``, the list elements are owned by GTK+
 and must not be freed or modified, the list itself must be deleted
 through `glib::List::free`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn group -->
Adds `gesture` to the same group than `self`. Gestures
are by default isolated in their own groups.

Both gestures must have been added to the same widget before they
can be grouped.

When gestures are grouped, the state of ``GdkEventSequences``
is kept in sync for all of those, so calling `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`,
on one will transfer the same value to the others.

Groups also perform an "implicit grabbing" of sequences, if a
`gdk::EventSequence` state is set to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on one group,
every other gesture group attached to the same `Widget` will switch the
state for that sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.
## `gesture`
a `Gesture`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn handles_sequence -->
Returns `true` if `self` is currently handling events corresponding to
`sequence`.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence` or `None`

# Returns

`true` if `self` is handling `sequence`, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_active -->
Returns `true` if the gesture is currently active.
A gesture is active meanwhile there are touch sequences
interacting with it.

# Returns

`true` if gesture is active
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_grouped_with -->
Returns `true` if both gestures pertain to the same group.
## `other`
another `Gesture`

# Returns

whether the gestures are grouped
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_recognized -->
Returns `true` if the gesture is currently recognized.
A gesture is recognized if there are as many interacting
touch sequences as required by `self`, and `Gesture::check`
returned `true` for the sequences being currently interpreted.

# Returns

`true` if gesture is recognized
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_sequence_state -->
Sets the state of `sequence` in `self`. Sequences start
in state `EventSequenceState::None`, and whenever they change
state, they can never go back to that state. Likewise,
sequences in state `EventSequenceState::Denied` cannot turn
back to a not denied state. With these rules, the lifetime
of an event sequence is constrained to the next four:

* None
* None → Denied
* None → Claimed
* None → Claimed → Denied

Note: Due to event handling ordering, it may be unsafe to
set the state on another gesture within a `Gesture::begin`
signal handler, as the callback might be executed before
the other gesture knows about the sequence. A safe way to
perform this could be:


```text
static void
first_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *first_gesture,
                        GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                        gpointer          user_data)
{
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED);
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}

static void
second_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *second_gesture,
                         GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                         gpointer          user_data)
{
  if (gtk_gesture_get_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence) == GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED)
    gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}
```

If both gestures are in the same group, just set the state on
the gesture emitting the event, the sequence will be already
be initialized to the group's global state when the second
gesture processes the event.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`
## `state`
the sequence state

# Returns

`true` if `sequence` is handled by `self`,
 and the state is changed successfully
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the state of all sequences that `self` is currently
interacting with. See `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`
for more details on sequence states.
## `state`
the sequence state

# Returns

`true` if the state of at least one sequence
 was changed successfully
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn ungroup -->
Separates `self` into an isolated group.
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_begin -->
This signal is emitted when the gesture is recognized. This means the
number of touch sequences matches `Gesture:n-points`, and the `Gesture::check`
handler(s) returned `true`.

Note: These conditions may also happen when an extra touch (eg. a third touch
on a 2-touches gesture) is lifted, in that situation `sequence` won't pertain
to the current set of active touches, so don't rely on this being true.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that made the gesture to be recognized
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_cancel -->
This signal is emitted whenever a sequence is cancelled. This usually
happens on active touches when `EventControllerExt::reset` is called
on `gesture` (manually, due to grabs...), or the individual `sequence`
was claimed by parent widgets' controllers (see `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`).

`gesture` must forget everything about `sequence` as a reaction to this signal.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was cancelled
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_end -->
This signal is emitted when `gesture` either stopped recognizing the event
sequences as something to be handled (the `Gesture::check` handler returned
`false`), or the number of touch sequences became higher or lower than
`Gesture:n-points`.

Note: `sequence` might not pertain to the group of sequences that were
previously triggering recognition on `gesture` (ie. a just pressed touch
sequence that exceeds `Gesture:n-points`). This situation may be detected
by checking through `GestureExt::handles_sequence`.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that made gesture recognition to finish
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_sequence_state_changed -->
This signal is emitted whenever a sequence state changes. See
`GestureExt::set_sequence_state` to know more about the expectable
sequence lifetimes.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was cancelled
## `state`
the new sequence state
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_update -->
This signal is emitted whenever an event is handled while the gesture is
recognized. `sequence` is guaranteed to pertain to the set of active touches.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was updated
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_property_n_points -->
The number of touch points that trigger recognition on this gesture,
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_property_n_points -->
The number of touch points that trigger recognition on this gesture,
<!-- struct GestureDrag -->
`GestureDrag` is a `Gesture` implementation that recognizes drag
operations. The drag operation itself can be tracked throught the
`GestureDrag::drag-begin`, `GestureDrag::drag-update` and
`GestureDrag::drag-end` signals, or the relevant coordinates be
extracted through `GestureDragExt::get_offset` and
`GestureDragExt::get_start_point`.

as an offset to the starting drag point.
## `x`
X offset for the current point
## `y`
Y offset for the current point

# Returns

`true` if the gesture is active
<!-- trait GestureDragExt::fn get_start_point -->
If the `self` is active, this function returns `true`
and fills in `x` and `y` with the drag start coordinates,
in window-relative coordinates.
## `x`
X coordinate for the drag start point
## `y`
Y coordinate for the drag start point

# Returns

`true` if the gesture is active
<!-- trait GestureDragExt::fn connect_drag_begin -->
This signal is emitted whenever dragging starts.
## `start_x`
X coordinate, relative to the widget allocation
## `start_y`

<!-- trait GestureDragExt::fn connect_drag_end -->
This signal is emitted whenever the dragging is finished.
## `offset_x`
X offset, relative to the start point
## `offset_y`
Y offset, relative to the start point
<!-- trait GestureDragExt::fn connect_drag_update -->
This signal is emitted whenever the dragging point moves.
## `offset_x`
X offset, relative to the start point
## `offset_y`
Y offset, relative to the start point
<!-- struct GestureLongPress -->
`GestureLongPress` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
long presses, triggering the `GestureLongPress::pressed` after the
timeout is exceeded.

If the touchpoint is lifted before the timeout passes, or if it drifts
too far of the initial press point, the `GestureLongPress::cancelled`
signal will be emitted.

# Returns

<!-- impl GestureLongPress::fn connect_cancelled -->
This signal is emitted whenever a press moved too far, or was released
before `GestureLongPress::pressed` happened.
<!-- impl GestureLongPress::fn connect_pressed -->
This signal is emitted whenever a press goes unmoved/unreleased longer than
what the GTK+ defaults tell.
## `x`
the X coordinate where the press happened, relative to the widget allocation
## `y`
the Y coordinate where the press happened, relative to the widget allocation
<!-- struct GestureMultiPress -->
`GestureMultiPress` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
multiple clicks on a nearby zone, which can be listened for through the
`GestureMultiPress::pressed` signal. Whenever time or distance between
clicks exceed the GTK+ defaults, `GestureMultiPress::stopped` is emitted,
and the click counter is reset.

Callers may also restrict the area that is considered valid for a >1
touch/button press through `GestureMultiPress::set_area`, so any
click happening outside that area is considered to be a first click of
its own.

<!-- impl GestureMultiPress::fn get_area -->
If an area was set through `GestureMultiPress::set_area`,
this function will return `true` and fill in `rect` with the
press area. See `GestureMultiPress::set_area` for more
details on what the press area represents.
## `rect`
return location for the press area

# Returns

`true` if `rect` was filled with the press area
<!-- impl GestureMultiPress::fn set_area -->
If `rect` is non-`None`, the press area will be checked to be
confined within the rectangle, otherwise the button count
will be reset so the press is seen as being the first one.
If `rect` is `None`, the area will be reset to an unrestricted
state.

Note: The rectangle is only used to determine whether any
non-first click falls within the expected area. This is not
akin to an input shape.
## `rect`

<!-- impl GestureMultiPress::fn connect_pressed -->
This signal is emitted whenever a button or touch press happens.
## `n_press`
how many touch/button presses happened with this one
## `x`
The X coordinate, in widget allocation coordinates
## `y`
The Y coordinate, in widget allocation coordinates
<!-- impl GestureMultiPress::fn connect_released -->
This signal is emitted when a button or touch is released. `n_press`
will report the number of press that is paired to this event, note
that `GestureMultiPress::stopped` may have been emitted between the
press and its release, `n_press` will only start over at the next press.

event that had no previous corresponding press. Due to implicit
grabs, this can only happen on situations where input is grabbed
elsewhere mid-press or the pressed widget voluntarily relinquishes
its implicit grab.

## `y`
Y coordinate of the event
## `button`
Button being released
## `sequence`
Sequence being released
<!-- struct GesturePan -->
`GesturePan` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
pan gestures, those are drags that are locked to happen along one
axis. The axis that a `GesturePan` handles is defined at
construct time, and can be changed through
`GesturePan::set_orientation`.

When the gesture starts to be recognized, `GesturePan` will
attempt to determine as early as possible whether the sequence
is moving in the expected direction, and denying the sequence if
this does not happen.

Once a panning gesture along the expected axis is recognized,
the `GesturePan::pan` signal will be emitted as input events
are received, containing the offset in the given axis.

<!-- struct GestureSingle -->
`GestureSingle` is a subclass of `Gesture`, optimized (although
not restricted) for dealing with mouse and single-touch gestures. Under
interaction, these gestures stick to the first interacting sequence, which
is accessible through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_sequence` while the
gesture is being interacted with.

By default gestures react to both `GDK_BUTTON_PRIMARY` and touch
events, `GestureSingleExt::set_touch_only` can be used to change the
touch behavior. Callers may also specify a different mouse button number
to interact with through `GestureSingleExt::set_button`, or react to any
mouse button by setting 0. While the gesture is active, the button being
currently pressed can be known through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_button`.

<!-- struct Grid -->
`Grid` is a container which arranges its child widgets in
rows and columns, with arbitrary positions and horizontal/vertical spans.

Children are added using `GridExt::attach`. They can span multiple
rows or columns. It is also possible to add a child next to an
existing child, using `GridExt::attach_next_to`. The behaviour of
`Grid` when several children occupy the same grid cell is undefined.

`Grid` can be used like a `Box` by just using `ContainerExt::add`,
which will place children next to each other in the direction determined
by the `Orientable:orientation` property. However, if all you want is a
single row or column, then `Box` is the preferred widget.

# CSS nodes

`Grid` uses a single CSS node with name grid.

<!-- struct GridLayout -->
`GridLayout` is a layout manager which arranges child widgets in
rows and columns, with arbitrary positions and horizontal/vertical
spans.

Children have an "attach point" defined by the horizontal and vertical
index of the cell they occupy; children can span multiple rows or columns.
The layout properties for setting the attach points and spans are set
using the `GridLayoutChild` associated to each child widget.

The behaviour of `Grid` when several children occupy the same grid cell
is undefined.

`GridLayout` can be used like a `BoxLayout` if all children are attached
to the same row or column; however, if you only ever need a single row or
column, you should consider using `BoxLayout`.

<!-- struct HeaderBar -->
`HeaderBar` is similar to a horizontal `Box`. It allows children to
be placed at the start or the end. In addition, it allows a title and
subtitle to be displayed. The title will be centered with respect to
the width of the box, even if the children at either side take up
different amounts of space. The height of the titlebar will be
set to provide sufficient space for the subtitle, even if none is
currently set. If a subtitle is not needed, the space reservation
can be turned off with `HeaderBarExt::set_has_subtitle`.

`HeaderBar` can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize,
maximize and close buttons, or the window icon.

For these reasons, `HeaderBar` is the natural choice for use as the custom
titlebar widget of a `Window` (see `GtkWindowExt::set_titlebar`), as it gives
features typical of titlebars while allowing the addition of child widgets.

<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_subtitle -->
Retrieves the subtitle of the header. See `HeaderBarExt::set_subtitle`.

# Returns

the subtitle of the header, or `None` if none has
 been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
 and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_title -->
Retrieves the title of the header. See `HeaderBarExt::set_title`.

# Returns

the title of the header, or `None` if none has
 been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
 and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
end of the `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn pack_start -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
start of the `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to be added to `self`
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_custom_title -->
Sets a custom title for the `HeaderBar`.

The title should help a user identify the current view. This
supersedes any title set by `HeaderBarExt::set_title` or
`HeaderBarExt::set_subtitle`. To achieve the same style as
the builtin title and subtitle, use the “title” and “subtitle”
style classes.

You should set the custom title to `None`, for the header title
label to be visible again.
## `title_widget`
a custom widget to use for a title
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_decoration_layout -->
Sets the decoration layout for this header bar, overriding
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting.

There can be valid reasons for overriding the setting, such
as a header bar design that does not allow for buttons to take
room on the right, or only offers room for a single close button.
Split header bars are another example for overriding the
setting.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close, icon (the window icon) and menu (a menu button
for the fallback app menu).

For example, “menu:minimize,maximize,close” specifies a menu
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.
## `layout`
a decoration layout, or `None` to
 unset the layout
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_has_subtitle -->
Sets whether the header bar should reserve space
for a subtitle, even if none is currently set.
## `setting`
`true` to reserve space for a subtitle
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_show_title_buttons -->
Sets whether this header bar shows the standard window
title buttons including close, maximize, and minimize.
## `setting`
`true` to show standard title buttons
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_subtitle -->
Sets the subtitle of the `HeaderBar`. The title should give a user
an additional detail to help him identify the current view.

Note that `HeaderBar` by default reserves room for the subtitle,
even if none is currently set. If this is not desired, set the
`HeaderBar:has-subtitle` property to `false`.
## `subtitle`
a subtitle, or `None`
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `HeaderBar`. The title should help a user
identify the current view. A good title should not include the
application name.
## `title`
a title, or `None`
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for buttons. If this property is
not set, the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting
is used.

See `HeaderBarExt::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for buttons. If this property is
not set, the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting
is used.

See `HeaderBarExt::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_property_decoration_layout_set -->
Set to `true` if `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` is set.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_property_decoration_layout_set -->
Set to `true` if `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` is set.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_property_has_subtitle -->
If `true`, reserve space for a subtitle, even if none
is currently set.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_property_has_subtitle -->
If `true`, reserve space for a subtitle, even if none
is currently set.
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn get_property_show_title_buttons -->
Whether to show title buttons like close, minimize, maximize.

Which buttons are actually shown and where is determined
by the `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property, and by
the state of the window (e.g. a close button will not be
shown if the window can't be closed).
<!-- trait HeaderBarExt::fn set_property_show_title_buttons -->
Whether to show title buttons like close, minimize, maximize.

Which buttons are actually shown and where is determined
by the `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property, and by
the state of the window (e.g. a close button will not be
shown if the window can't be closed).
<!-- struct IMContext -->
`IMContext` defines the interface for GTK+ input methods. An input method
is used by GTK+ text input widgets like `Entry` to map from key events to
Unicode character strings.

The default input method can be set programmatically via the
`Settings:gtk-im-module` `Settings` property. Alternatively, you may set
the GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable as documented in
[Running GTK+ Applications][gtk-running].

The `Entry` `Entry:im-module` and `TextView` `TextView:im-module`
properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget
instances. For instance, a certain entry widget might be expected to contain
certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain input
method.

An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally
output the composed result. This is called preediting, and an input method
may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
composition states as preedit text. For instance, the default GTK+ input
method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down
the Control and Shift keys and then typing “U” followed by the hexadecimal
digits of the code point. When releasing the Control and Shift keys,
preediting ends and the character is inserted as text. Ctrl+Shift+u20AC for
example results in the € sign.

Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK+ widgets as
loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
implements a subclass of `IMContext` or `IMContextSimple` and exports
these four functions:


```C
void im_module_init(GTypeModule *module);
```
This function should register the `glib::Type` of the `IMContext` subclass which
implements the input method by means of `gobject::TypeModule::register_type`. Note
that `g_type_register_static` cannot be used as the type needs to be
registered dynamically.


```C
void im_module_exit(void);
```
Here goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module unload.


```C
void im_module_list(const GtkIMContextInfo ***contexts, int *n_contexts)
{
  *contexts = info_list;
  *n_contexts = G_N_ELEMENTS (info_list);
}
```
This function returns the list of input methods provided by the module. The
example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns a
pointer to statically defined array of ``GtkIMContextInfo`` items for each
provided input method.


```C
GtkIMContext * im_module_create(const gchar *context_id);
```
This function should return a pointer to a newly created instance of the
`IMContext` subclass identified by `context_id`. The context ID is the same
as specified in the ``GtkIMContextInfo`` array returned by `im_module_list`.

After a new loadable input method module has been installed on the system,
the configuration file `gtk.immodules` needs to be
regenerated by [gtk-query-immodules-3.0][gtk-query-immodules-3.0],
in order for the new input method to become available to GTK+ applications.

# Implements

[`IMContextExt`](trait.IMContextExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait IMContextExt -->
Trait containing all `IMContext` methods.

# Implementors

[`IMContextSimple`](struct.IMContextSimple.html), [`IMContext`](struct.IMContext.html), [`IMMulticontext`](struct.IMMulticontext.html)
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn delete_surrounding -->
Asks the widget that the input context is attached to to delete
characters around the cursor position by emitting the
`IMContext`::delete_surrounding signal. Note that `offset` and `n_chars`
are in characters not in bytes which differs from the usage other
places in `IMContext`.

In order to use this function, you should first call
`IMContextExt::get_surrounding` to get the current context, and
call this function immediately afterwards to make sure that you
know what you are deleting. You should also account for the fact
that even if the signal was handled, the input context might not
have deleted all the characters that were requested to be deleted.

This function is used by an input method that wants to make
subsitutions in the existing text in response to new input. It is
not useful for applications.
## `offset`
offset from cursor position in chars;
 a negative value means start before the cursor.
## `n_chars`
number of characters to delete.

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn filter_keypress -->
Allow an input method to internally handle key press and release
events. If this function returns `true`, then no further processing
should be done for this key event.
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn focus_in -->
Notify the input method that the widget to which this
input context corresponds has gained focus. The input method
may, for example, change the displayed feedback to reflect
this change.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn focus_out -->
Notify the input method that the widget to which this
input context corresponds has lost focus. The input method
may, for example, change the displayed feedback or reset the contexts
state to reflect this change.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn get_preedit_string -->
Retrieve the current preedit string for the input context,
and a list of attributes to apply to the string.
This string should be displayed inserted at the insertion
point.
## `str`
location to store the retrieved
 string. The string retrieved must be freed with `g_free`.
## `attrs`
location to store the retrieved
 attribute list. When you are done with this list, you
 must unreference it with `pango::AttrList::unref`.
## `cursor_pos`
location to store position of cursor (in characters)
 within the preedit string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn get_surrounding -->
Retrieves context around the insertion point. Input methods
typically want context in order to constrain input text based on
existing text; this is important for languages such as Thai where
only some sequences of characters are allowed.

This function is implemented by emitting the
`IMContext`::retrieve_surrounding signal on the input method; in
response to this signal, a widget should provide as much context as
is available, up to an entire paragraph, by calling
`IMContextExt::set_surrounding`. Note that there is no obligation
for a widget to respond to the ::retrieve_surrounding signal, so input
methods must be prepared to function without context.
## `text`
location to store a UTF-8 encoded
 string of text holding context around the insertion point.
 If the function returns `true`, then you must free the result
 stored in this location with `g_free`.
## `cursor_index`
location to store byte index of the insertion
 cursor within `text`.

# Returns

`true` if surrounding text was provided; in this case
 you must free the result stored in *text.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn reset -->
Notify the input method that a change such as a change in cursor
position has been made. This will typically cause the input
method to clear the preedit state.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_client_widget -->
Set the client window for the input context; this is the
`Widget` holding the input focus. This widget is
used in order to correctly position status windows, and may
also be used for purposes internal to the input method.
## `widget`
the client widget. This may be `None` to indicate
 that the previous client widget no longer exists.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_cursor_location -->
Notify the input method that a change in cursor
position has been made. The location is relative to the client
window.
## `area`
new location
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_surrounding -->
Sets surrounding context around the insertion point and preedit
string. This function is expected to be called in response to the
`IMContext`::retrieve_surrounding signal, and will likely have no
effect if called at other times.
## `text`
text surrounding the insertion point, as UTF-8.
 the preedit string should not be included within
 `text`.
## `len`
the length of `text`, or -1 if `text` is nul-terminated
## `cursor_index`
the byte index of the insertion cursor within `text`.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_use_preedit -->
Sets whether the IM context should use the preedit string
to display feedback. If `use_preedit` is FALSE (default
is TRUE), then the IM context may use some other method to display
feedback, such as displaying it in a child of the root window.
## `use_preedit`
whether the IM context should use the preedit string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_commit -->
The ::commit signal is emitted when a complete input sequence
has been entered by the user. This can be a single character
immediately after a key press or the final result of preediting.
## `str`
the completed character(s) entered by the user
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_delete_surrounding -->
The ::delete-surrounding signal is emitted when the input method
needs to delete all or part of the context surrounding the cursor.
## `offset`
the character offset from the cursor position of the text
 to be deleted. A negative value indicates a position before
 the cursor.
## `n_chars`
the number of characters to be deleted

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_changed -->
The ::preedit-changed signal is emitted whenever the preedit sequence
currently being entered has changed. It is also emitted at the end of
a preedit sequence, in which case
`IMContextExt::get_preedit_string` returns the empty string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_end -->
The ::preedit-end signal is emitted when a preediting sequence
has been completed or canceled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_start -->
The ::preedit-start signal is emitted when a new preediting sequence
starts.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_retrieve_surrounding -->
The ::retrieve-surrounding signal is emitted when the input method
requires the context surrounding the cursor. The callback should set
the input method surrounding context by calling the
`IMContextExt::set_surrounding` method.

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- struct IMContextSimple -->
`IMContextSimple` is a simple input method context supporting table-based
input methods. It has a built-in table of compose sequences that is derived
from the X11 Compose files.

`IMContextSimple` reads additional compose sequences from the first of the
following files that is found: ~/.config/gtk-4.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose,
/usr/share/X11/locale/$locale/Compose (for locales that have a nontrivial
Compose file). The syntax of these files is described in the Compose(5)
manual page.

## Unicode characters

`IMContextSimple` also supports numeric entry of Unicode characters
by typing Ctrl-Shift-u, followed by a hexadecimal Unicode codepoint.
For example, Ctrl-Shift-u 1 2 3 Enter yields U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER
G WITH CEDILLA, i.e. ģ.

<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn new -->
Creates a new `IMContextSimple`.

# Returns

a new `IMContextSimple`.
<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn add_compose_file -->
Adds an additional table from the X11 compose file.
## `compose_file`
The path of compose file
<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn add_table -->
Adds an additional table to search to the input context.
Each row of the table consists of `max_seq_len` key symbols
followed by two `guint16` interpreted as the high and low
words of a `gunicode` value. Tables are searched starting
from the last added.

The table must be sorted in dictionary order on the
numeric value of the key symbol fields. (Values beyond
the length of the sequence should be zero.)
## `data`
the table
## `max_seq_len`
Maximum length of a sequence in the table
 (cannot be greater than `GTK_MAX_COMPOSE_LEN`)
## `n_seqs`
number of sequences in the table

<!-- impl IMMulticontext::fn new -->
Creates a new `IMMulticontext`.

# Returns

a new `IMMulticontext`.
<!-- trait IMMulticontextExt::fn get_context_id -->
Gets the id of the currently active slave of the `self`.

# Returns

the id of the currently active slave
<!-- trait IMMulticontextExt::fn set_context_id -->
Sets the context id for `self`.

This causes the currently active slave of `self` to be
replaced by the slave corresponding to the new context id.
## `context_id`

<!-- struct IconInfo -->
Contains information found when looking up an icon in
an icon theme.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn new_for_pixbuf -->
Creates a `IconInfo` for a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`.
## `icon_theme`
a `IconTheme`
## `pixbuf`
the pixbuf to wrap in a `IconInfo`

# Returns

a `IconInfo`
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn get_base_scale -->
Gets the base scale for the icon. The base scale is a scale
for the icon that was specified by the icon theme creator.
For instance an icon drawn for a high-dpi monitor with window
scale 2 for a base size of 32 will be 64 pixels tall and have
a base scale of 2.

# Returns

the base scale
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn get_base_size -->
Gets the base size for the icon. The base size
is a size for the icon that was specified by
the icon theme creator. This may be different
than the actual size of image;
These icons will be given
the same base size as the larger icons to which
they are attached.

Note that for scaled icons the base size does
not include the base scale.

# Returns

the base size, or 0, if no base
 size is known for the icon.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn get_filename -->
Gets the filename for the icon. If the `IconLookupFlags::UseBuiltin`
flag was passed to `IconThemeExt::lookup_icon`, there may be no
filename if a builtin icon is returned; in this case, you should
use `gtk_icon_info_get_builtin_pixbuf`.

# Returns

the filename for the icon, or `None`
 if `gtk_icon_info_get_builtin_pixbuf` should be used instead.
 The return value is owned by GTK+ and should not be modified
 or freed.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn is_symbolic -->
Checks if the icon is symbolic or not. This currently uses only
the file name and not the file contents for determining this.
This behaviour may change in the future.

# Returns

`true` if the icon is symbolic, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_icon -->
Renders an icon previously looked up in an icon theme using
`IconThemeExt::lookup_icon`; the size will be based on the size
passed to `IconThemeExt::lookup_icon`. Note that the resulting
pixbuf may not be exactly this size; an icon theme may have icons
that differ slightly from their nominal sizes, and in addition GTK+
will avoid scaling icons that it considers sufficiently close to the
requested size or for which the source image would have to be scaled
up too far. (This maintains sharpness.). This behaviour can be changed
by passing the `IconLookupFlags::ForceSize` flag when obtaining
the `IconInfo`. If this flag has been specified, the pixbuf
returned by this function will be scaled to the exact size.

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be a newly
 created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so you must
 not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release your reference
 to the icon.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_icon_async -->
Asynchronously load, render and scale an icon previously looked up
from the icon theme using `IconThemeExt::lookup_icon`.

For more details, see `IconInfo::load_icon` which is the synchronous
version of this call.
## `cancellable`
optional `gio::Cancellable` object, `None` to ignore
## `callback`
a `GAsyncReadyCallback` to call when the
 request is satisfied
## `user_data`
the data to pass to callback function
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_icon_finish -->
Finishes an async icon load, see `IconInfo::load_icon_async`.
## `res`
a `gio::AsyncResult`

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be a newly
 created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so you must
 not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release your reference
 to the icon.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_symbolic -->
Loads an icon, modifying it to match the system colours for the foreground,
success, warning and error colors provided. If the icon is not a symbolic
one, the function will return the result from `IconInfo::load_icon`.

This allows loading symbolic icons that will match the system theme.

Unless you are implementing a widget, you will want to use
`gio::ThemedIcon::new_with_default_fallbacks` to load the icon.

As implementation details, the icon loaded needs to be of SVG type,
contain the “symbolic” term as the last component of the icon name,
and use the “fg”, “success”, “warning” and “error” CSS styles in the
SVG file itself.

See the [Symbolic Icons Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/SymbolicIcons)
for more information about symbolic icons.
## `fg`
a `gdk::RGBA` representing the foreground color of the icon
## `success_color`
a `gdk::RGBA` representing the warning color
 of the icon or `None` to use the default color
## `warning_color`
a `gdk::RGBA` representing the warning color
 of the icon or `None` to use the default color
## `error_color`
a `gdk::RGBA` representing the error color
 of the icon or `None` to use the default color (allow-none)
## `was_symbolic`
a `gboolean`, returns whether the
 loaded icon was a symbolic one and whether the `fg` color was
 applied to it.

# Returns

a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` representing the loaded icon
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_symbolic_async -->

<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_symbolic_finish -->
Finishes an async icon load, see `IconInfo::load_symbolic_async`.
## `res`
a `gio::AsyncResult`
## `was_symbolic`
a `gboolean`, returns whether the
 loaded icon was a symbolic one and whether the `fg` color was
 applied to it.

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be a newly
 created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so you must
 not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release your reference
 to the icon.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_symbolic_for_context -->
Loads an icon, modifying it to match the system colors for the foreground,
success, warning and error colors provided. If the icon is not a symbolic
one, the function will return the result from `IconInfo::load_icon`.
This function uses the regular foreground color and the symbolic colors
with the names “success_color”, “warning_color” and “error_color” from
the context.

This allows loading symbolic icons that will match the system theme.

See `IconInfo::load_symbolic` for more details.
## `context`
a `StyleContext`
## `was_symbolic`
a `gboolean`, returns whether the
 loaded icon was a symbolic one and whether the foreground color was
 applied to it.

# Returns

 loaded icon was a symbolic one and whether the `fg` color was
 applied to it.

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be a newly
 created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so you must
 not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release your reference
 to the icon.
<!-- impl IconInfo::fn load_texture -->
Returns a texture object that can be used to render the icon
with GSK.

# Returns

the icon texture; this may be a newly
 created texture or a new reference to an exiting texture. Use
 `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release your reference.
<!-- enum IconSize -->
Built-in icon sizes.

Icon sizes default to being inherited. Where they cannot be
inherited, text size is the default.

All widgets which use `IconSize` set the normal-icons or large-icons
style classes correspondingly, and let themes determine the actual size
to be used with the -gtk-icon-size CSS property.
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Inherit -->
Keep the size of the parent element
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Normal -->
Size similar to text size
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Large -->
Large size, for example in an icon view
<!-- struct IconTheme -->
`IconTheme` provides a facility for looking up icons by name
and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
depending on what “icon theme” is selected
by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
as operating system vendors and users choose.

In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via `Image`
rather than directly, but looking up icons
directly is also simple. The `IconTheme` object acts
as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
can create new `IconTheme` objects, but it’s much more
efficient to use the standard icon theme for the `gdk::Display`
so that the icon information is shared with other people
looking up icons.

```C
GError *error = NULL;
GtkIconTheme *icon_theme;
GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;

icon_theme = gtk_icon_theme_get_default ();
pixbuf = gtk_icon_theme_load_icon (icon_theme,
                                   "my-icon-name", // icon name
                                   48, // icon size
                                   0,  // flags
                                   &error);
if (!pixbuf)
  {
    g_warning ("Couldn’t load icon: %s", error->message);
    g_error_free (error);
  }
else
  {
    // Use the pixbuf
    g_object_unref (pixbuf);
  }

or `IconTheme::get_for_display` rather than creating
a new icon theme object for scratch.

# Returns

the newly created `IconTheme` object.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_default -->
Gets the icon theme for the default display. See
`IconTheme::get_for_display`.

# Returns

A unique `IconTheme` associated with
 the default display. This icon theme is associated with
 the display and can be used as long as the display
 is open. Do not ref or unref it.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_for_display -->
Gets the icon theme object associated with `display`; if this
function has not previously been called for the given
display, a new icon theme object will be created and
associated with the display. Icon theme objects are
fairly expensive to create, so using this function
is usually a better choice than calling than `IconTheme::new`
and setting the display yourself; by using this function
a single icon theme object will be shared between users.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`

# Returns

A unique `IconTheme` associated with
 the given display. This icon theme is associated with
 the display and can be used as long as the display
 is open. Do not ref or unref it.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn add_resource_path -->
Adds a resource path that will be looked at when looking
for icons, similar to search paths.

This function should be used to make application-specific icons
available as part of the icon theme.

The resources are considered as part of the hicolor icon theme
and must be located in subdirectories that are defined in the
hicolor icon theme, such as `@path/16x16/actions/run.png`.
Icons that are directly placed in the resource path instead
of a subdirectory are also considered as ultimate fallback.
## `path`
a resource path
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn append_search_path -->
Appends a directory to the search path.
See `IconThemeExt::set_search_path`.
## `path`
directory name to append to the icon path
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn choose_icon -->
Looks up a named icon and returns a `IconInfo` containing
information such as the filename of the icon. The icon
can then be rendered into a pixbuf using
`IconInfo::load_icon`. (`IconThemeExt::load_icon`
combines these two steps if all you need is the pixbuf.)

If `icon_names` contains more than one name, this function
tries them all in the given order before falling back to
inherited icon themes.
## `icon_names`
`None`-terminated array of
 icon names to lookup
## `size`
desired icon size
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` object
containing information about the icon, or `None` if the icon wasn’t
found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn choose_icon_for_scale -->
Looks up a named icon for a particular window scale and returns
a `IconInfo` containing information such as the filename of the
icon. The icon can then be rendered into a pixbuf using
`IconInfo::load_icon`. (`IconThemeExt::load_icon`
combines these two steps if all you need is the pixbuf.)

If `icon_names` contains more than one name, this function
tries them all in the given order before falling back to
inherited icon themes.
## `icon_names`
`None`-terminated
 array of icon names to lookup
## `size`
desired icon size
## `scale`
desired scale
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` object
 containing information about the icon, or `None` if the
 icon wasn’t found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn get_example_icon_name -->
Gets the name of an icon that is representative of the
current theme (for instance, to use when presenting
a list of themes to the user.)

# Returns

the name of an example icon or `None`.
 Free with `g_free`.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn get_icon_sizes -->
Returns an array of integers describing the sizes at which
the icon is available without scaling. A size of -1 means
that the icon is available in a scalable format. The array
is zero-terminated.
## `icon_name`
the name of an icon

# Returns

An newly
allocated array describing the sizes at which the icon is
available. The array should be freed with `g_free` when it is no
longer needed.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn get_search_path -->
Gets the current search path. See `IconThemeExt::set_search_path`.
## `path`

 location to store a list of icon theme path directories or `None`.
 The stored value should be freed with `g_strfreev`.
## `n_elements`
location to store number of elements in `path`, or `None`
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn has_icon -->
Checks whether an icon theme includes an icon
for a particular name.
## `icon_name`
the name of an icon

# Returns

`true` if `self` includes an
 icon for `icon_name`.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn list_contexts -->
Gets the list of contexts available within the current
hierarchy of icon themes.
See `IconThemeExt::list_icons` for details about contexts.

# Returns

a `glib::List` list
 holding the names of all the contexts in the theme. You must first
 free each element in the list with `g_free`, then free the list
 itself with `glib::List::free`.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn list_icons -->
Lists the icons in the current icon theme. Only a subset
of the icons can be listed by providing a context string.
The set of values for the context string is system dependent,
but will typically include such values as “Applications” and
“MimeTypes”. Contexts are explained in the
[Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec).
The standard contexts are listed in the
[Icon Naming Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-naming-spec).
Also see `IconThemeExt::list_contexts`.
## `context`
a string identifying a particular type of
 icon, or `None` to list all icons.

# Returns

a `glib::List` list
 holding the names of all the icons in the theme. You must
 first free each element in the list with `g_free`, then
 free the list itself with `glib::List::free`.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn load_icon -->
Looks up an icon in an icon theme, scales it to the given size
and renders it into a pixbuf. This is a convenience function;
if more details about the icon are needed, use
`IconThemeExt::lookup_icon` followed by `IconInfo::load_icon`.

Note that you probably want to listen for icon theme changes and
update the icon. This is usually done by connecting to the
`Widget`::style-set signal. If for some reason you do not want to
update the icon when the icon theme changes, you should consider
using `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::copy` to make a private copy of the pixbuf
returned by this function. Otherwise GTK+ may need to keep the old
icon theme loaded, which would be a waste of memory.
## `icon_name`
the name of the icon to lookup
## `size`
the desired icon size. The resulting icon may not be
 exactly this size; see `IconInfo::load_icon`.
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be
 a newly created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so
 you must not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release
 your reference to the icon. `None` if the icon isn’t found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn load_icon_for_scale -->
Looks up an icon in an icon theme for a particular window scale,
scales it to the given size and renders it into a pixbuf. This is a
convenience function; if more details about the icon are needed,
use `IconThemeExt::lookup_icon` followed by
`IconInfo::load_icon`.

## `icon_name`
the name of the icon to lookup
## `size`
the desired icon size. The resulting icon may not be
 exactly this size; see `IconInfo::load_icon`.
## `scale`
desired scale
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

the rendered icon; this may be
 a newly created icon or a new reference to an internal icon, so
 you must not modify the icon. Use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release
 your reference to the icon. `None` if the icon isn’t found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn lookup_by_gicon -->
Looks up an icon and returns a `IconInfo` containing information
such as the filename of the icon. The icon can then be rendered
into a pixbuf using `IconInfo::load_icon`.

When rendering on displays with high pixel densities you should not
use a `size` multiplied by the scaling factor returned by functions
like `gdk::SurfaceExt::get_scale_factor`. Instead, you should use
`IconThemeExt::lookup_by_gicon_for_scale`, as the assets loaded
for a given scaling factor may be different.
## `icon`
the `gio::Icon` to look up
## `size`
desired icon size
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` containing
 information about the icon, or `None` if the icon wasn’t
 found. Unref with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn lookup_by_gicon_for_scale -->
Looks up an icon and returns a `IconInfo` containing information
such as the filename of the icon. The icon can then be rendered into
a pixbuf using `IconInfo::load_icon`.
## `icon`
the `gio::Icon` to look up
## `size`
desired icon size
## `scale`
the desired scale
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` containing
 information about the icon, or `None` if the icon wasn’t
 found. Unref with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn lookup_icon -->
Looks up a named icon and returns a `IconInfo` containing
information such as the filename of the icon. The icon
can then be rendered into a pixbuf using
`IconInfo::load_icon`. (`IconThemeExt::load_icon`
combines these two steps if all you need is the pixbuf.)

When rendering on displays with high pixel densities you should not
use a `size` multiplied by the scaling factor returned by functions
like `gdk::SurfaceExt::get_scale_factor`. Instead, you should use
`IconThemeExt::lookup_icon_for_scale`, as the assets loaded
for a given scaling factor may be different.
## `icon_name`
the name of the icon to lookup
## `size`
desired icon size
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` object
 containing information about the icon, or `None` if the
 icon wasn’t found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn lookup_icon_for_scale -->
Looks up a named icon for a particular window scale and returns a
`IconInfo` containing information such as the filename of the
icon. The icon can then be rendered into a pixbuf using
`IconInfo::load_icon`. (`IconThemeExt::load_icon` combines
these two steps if all you need is the pixbuf.)
## `icon_name`
the name of the icon to lookup
## `size`
desired icon size
## `scale`
the desired scale
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconInfo` object
 containing information about the icon, or `None` if the
 icon wasn’t found.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn prepend_search_path -->
Prepends a directory to the search path.
See `IconThemeExt::set_search_path`.
## `path`
directory name to prepend to the icon path
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn rescan_if_needed -->
Checks to see if the icon theme has changed; if it has, any
currently cached information is discarded and will be reloaded
next time `self` is accessed.

# Returns

`true` if the icon theme has changed and needed
 to be reloaded.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn set_custom_theme -->
Sets the name of the icon theme that the `IconTheme` object uses
overriding system configuration. This function cannot be called
on the icon theme objects returned from `IconTheme::get_default`
and `IconTheme::get_for_display`.
## `theme_name`
name of icon theme to use instead of
 configured theme, or `None` to unset a previously set custom theme
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn set_display -->
Sets the display for an icon theme; the display is used
to track the user’s currently configured icon theme,
which might be different for different displays.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn set_search_path -->
Sets the search path for the icon theme object. When looking
for an icon theme, GTK+ will search for a subdirectory of
one or more of the directories in `path` with the same name
as the icon theme containing an index.theme file. (Themes from
multiple of the path elements are combined to allow themes to be
extended by adding icons in the user’s home directory.)

In addition if an icon found isn’t found either in the current
icon theme or the default icon theme, and an image file with
the right name is found directly in one of the elements of
`path`, then that image will be used for the icon name.
(This is legacy feature, and new icons should be put
into the fallback icon theme, which is called hicolor,
rather than directly on the icon path.)
## `path`
array of
 directories that are searched for icon themes
## `n_elements`
number of elements in `path`.
<!-- trait IconThemeExt::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted when the current icon theme is switched or GTK+ detects
that a change has occurred in the contents of the current
icon theme.
<!-- enum IconThemeError -->
Error codes for `IconTheme` operations.
<!-- enum IconThemeError::variant NotFound -->
The icon specified does not exist in the theme
<!-- enum IconThemeError::variant Failed -->
An unspecified error occurred.
<!-- struct IconView -->
`IconView` provides an alternative view on a `TreeModel`.
It displays the model as a grid of icons with labels. Like
`TreeView`, it allows to select one or multiple items
(depending on the selection mode, see `IconViewExt::set_selection_mode`).
In addition to selection with the arrow keys, `IconView` supports
rubberband selection, which is controlled by dragging the pointer.

Note that if the tree model is backed by an actual tree store (as
opposed to a flat list where the mapping to icons is obvious),
`IconView` will only display the first level of the tree and
ignore the tree’s branches.

# CSS nodes


```plain
iconview.view
╰── [rubberband]
```

`IconView` has a single CSS node with name iconview and style class .view.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

planning on modifying the model after calling this function, you may
want to convert the returned list into a list of ``GtkTreeRowReferences``.
To do this, you can use `TreeRowReference::new`.

To free the return value, use:

```C
g_list_free_full (list, (GDestroyNotify) gtk_tree_path_free);
```

# Returns

<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn get_tooltip_context -->
This function is supposed to be used in a `Widget::query-tooltip`
signal handler for `IconView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is an icon view item at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the item returned will be the cursor item. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model.
## `x`
the x coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `y`
the y coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `keyboard_tip`
whether this is a keyboard tooltip or not
## `model`
a pointer to receive a
 `TreeModel` or `None`
## `path`
a pointer to receive a `TreePath` or `None`
## `iter`
a pointer to receive a `TreeIter` or `None`

# Returns

whether or not the given tooltip context points to a item
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn get_visible_range -->

Note that there may be invisible paths in between.

Both paths should be freed with `TreePath::free` after use.
## `start_path`
Return location for start of region,
 or `None`
## `end_path`
Return location for end of region, or `None`

# Returns

`true`, if valid paths were placed in `start_path` and `end_path`
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn item_activated -->
Activates the item determined by `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be activated
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn path_is_selected -->
Returns `true` if the icon pointed to by `path` is currently
selected. If `path` does not point to a valid location, `false` is returned.
## `path`
A `TreePath` to check selection on.

# Returns

`true` if `path` is selected.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn scroll_to_path -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `path`.
`row_align` determines where the row is placed, and `col_align` determines
where `column` is placed. Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means
center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.
This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on
the model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the
centered path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the item to move to.
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments, or `false`.
## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the item specified by `path`.
## `col_align`
The horizontal alignment of the item specified by `path`.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn select_all -->
Selects all the icons. `self` must has its selection mode set
to `SelectionMode::Multiple`.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn select_path -->
Selects the row at `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be selected.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected icon. Note that the model or
selection cannot be modified from within this function.
## `func`
The function to call for each selected icon.
## `data`
User data to pass to the function.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->
Causes the `IconView::item-activated` signal to be emitted on
a single click instead of a double click.
## `single`
`true` to emit item-activated on a single click
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_column_spacing -->
Sets the ::column-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the columns of the icon view.
## `column_spacing`
the column spacing
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_columns -->
Sets the ::columns property which determines in how
many columns the icons are arranged. If `columns` is
-1, the number of columns will be chosen automatically
to fill the available area.
## `columns`
the number of columns
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular item.
If `cell` is not `None`, then focus is given to the cell specified by
it. Additionally, if `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be
started in the specified cell.

This function is often followed by `gtk_widget_grab_focus
(icon_view)` in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.
Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `cell`
One of the cell renderers of `self`, or `None`
## `start_editing`
`true` if the specified cell should start being edited.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_drag_dest_item -->
Sets the item that is highlighted for feedback.
## `path`
The path of the item to highlight, or `None`.
## `pos`
Specifies where to drop, relative to the item
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_item_orientation -->
Sets the ::item-orientation property which determines whether the labels
are drawn beside the icons instead of below.
## `orientation`
the relative position of texts and icons
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_item_padding -->
Sets the `IconView:item-padding` property which specifies the padding
around each of the icon view’s items.
## `item_padding`
the item padding
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_item_width -->
Sets the ::item-width property which specifies the width
to use for each item. If it is set to -1, the icon view will
automatically determine a suitable item size.
## `item_width`
the width for each item
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_margin -->
Sets the ::margin property which specifies the space
which is inserted at the top, bottom, left and right
of the icon view.
## `margin`
the margin
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_markup_column -->
Sets the column with markup information for `self` to be
`column`. The markup column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.
If the markup column is set to something, it overrides
the text column set by `IconViewExt::set_text_column`.
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `IconView`.
If the `self` already has a model set, it will remove
it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`, then
it will unset the old model.
## `model`
The model.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_pixbuf_column -->
Sets the column with pixbufs for `self` to be `column`. The pixbuf
column must be of type `GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF`
## `column`

<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models that
support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the `TreeDragDestIface`. Both
`TreeStore` and `ListStore` support these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then
the user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows. The
developer can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's
row_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting up
the icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag and
drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the list of items can be reordered.
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_row_spacing -->
Sets the ::row-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the rows of the icon view.

## `path`
a `TreePath`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full items, you
can use this function to have `IconView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- trait IconViewExt::fn set_tooltip_item -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the item at `path`.

<!-- struct Image -->
The `Image` widget displays an image. Various kinds of object
can be displayed as an image; most typically, you would load a
`gdk::Texture` from a file, and then display that.
There’s a convenience function to do this, `Image::new_from_file`,
used as follows:

```C
  GtkWidget *image;
  image = gtk_image_new_from_file ("myfile.png");
```
If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a
“broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file`, then create the `Image` with
`Image::new_from_paintable`.

Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
files, such as image files. See the documentation of `gio::Resource` for details.
In this case, the `Image:resource`, `Image::new_from_resource` and
`ImageExt::set_from_resource` should be used.

# CSS nodes

`Image` has a single CSS node with the name image. The style classes
.normal-icons or .large-icons may appear, depending on the `Image:icon-size`
property.

# Implements

[`ImageExt`](trait.ImageExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait ImageExt -->
Trait containing all `Image` methods.

# Implementors

[`Image`](struct.Image.html)
<!-- impl Image::fn new -->
Creates a new empty `Image` widget.

# Returns

a newly created `Image` widget.
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_file -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the file `filename`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will
display a “broken image” icon. This function never returns `None`,
it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the texture.

The storage type (`ImageExt::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.
## `filename`
a filename

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_gicon -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be
displayed instead. If the current icon theme is changed, the icon
will be updated appropriately.

Note: Before 3.94, this function was taking an extra icon size
argument. See `ImageExt::set_icon_size` for another way to set
the icon size.
## `icon`
an icon

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_icon_name -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be
displayed instead. If the current icon theme is changed, the icon
will be updated appropriately.

Note: Before 3.94, this function was taking an extra icon size
argument. See `ImageExt::set_icon_size` for another way to set
the icon size.
## `icon_name`
an icon name or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_paintable -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying `paintable`.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the
paintable; you still need to unref it if you own references.
`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

The `Image` will track changes to the `paintable` and update
its size and contents in response to it.
## `paintable`
a `gdk::Paintable`, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_pixbuf -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying `pixbuf`.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the
pixbuf; you still need to unref it if you own references.
`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

This is a helper for `gtk_image_new_from_texture`, and you can't
get back the exact pixbuf once this is called, only a texture.

Note that this function just creates an `Image` from the pixbuf. The
`Image` created will not react to state changes. Should you want that,
you should use `Image::new_from_icon_name`.
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_resource -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the resource file `resource_path`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will
display a “broken image” icon. This function never returns `None`,
it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the pixbuf.

The storage type (`ImageExt::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.

<!-- enum ImageType -->
Describes the image data representation used by a `Image`. If you
want to get the image from the widget, you can only get the
currently-stored representation. e.g. if the
`ImageExt::get_storage_type` returns `ImageType::Paintable`, then you can
call `ImageExt::get_paintable`. For empty images, you can request any
storage type (call any of the "get" functions), but they will all
return `None` values.

<!-- struct InfoBar -->
`InfoBar` is a widget that can be used to show messages to
the user without showing a dialog. It is often temporarily shown
at the top or bottom of a document. In contrast to `Dialog`, which
has a action area at the bottom, `InfoBar` has an action area
at the side.

The API of `InfoBar` is very similar to `Dialog`, allowing you
to add buttons to the action area with `InfoBarExt::add_button` or
`InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. The sensitivity of action widgets
can be controlled with `InfoBarExt::set_response_sensitive`.
To add widgets to the main content area of a `InfoBar`, use
`InfoBarExt::get_content_area` and add your widgets to the container.

Similar to `MessageDialog`, the contents of a `InfoBar` can by
classified as error message, warning, informational message, etc,
by using `InfoBarExt::set_message_type`. GTK+ may use the message type
to determine how the message is displayed.

A simple example for using a `InfoBar`:

```C
GtkWidget *widget, *message_label, *content_area;
GtkWidget *grid;
GtkInfoBar *bar;

// set up info bar
widget = gtk_info_bar_new ();
bar = GTK_INFO_BAR (widget);
grid = gtk_grid_new ();

message_label = gtk_label_new ("");
content_area = gtk_info_bar_get_content_area (bar);
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (content_area),
                   message_label);
gtk_info_bar_add_button (bar,
                         _("_OK"),
                         GTK_RESPONSE_OK);
g_signal_connect (bar,
                  "response",
                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_hide),
                  NULL);
gtk_grid_attach (GTK_GRID (grid),
                 widget,
                 0, 2, 1, 1);

// ...

// show an error message
gtk_label_set_text (GTK_LABEL (message_label), "An error occurred!");
gtk_info_bar_set_message_type (bar,
                               GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR);
gtk_widget_show (bar);
```

# `InfoBar` as `Buildable`

The `InfoBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes
the content area and action area as internal children with the names
“content_area” and “action_area”.

`InfoBar` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`).

# CSS nodes

`InfoBar` has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get
one of the style classes .info, .warning, .error or .question, depending

<!-- trait InfoBarExt -->
Trait containing all `InfoBar` methods.

# Implementors

[`InfoBar`](struct.InfoBar.html)
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` object.

# Returns

a new `InfoBar` object
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` with buttons. Button text/response ID
pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending the list.
A response ID can be any positive number,
or one of the values in the `ResponseType` enumeration. If the
user clicks one of these dialog buttons, `InfoBar` will emit
the “response” signal with the corresponding response ID.
## `first_button_text`
ext to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `InfoBar`
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn add_action_widget -->
Add an activatable widget to the action area of a `InfoBar`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `InfoBar::response`
signal on the message area when the widget is activated. The widget
is appended to the end of the message areas action area.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the “response” signal with the given
response_id. The button is appended to the end of the info bars's
action area. The button widget is returned, but usually you don't
need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget
that was added
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `InfoBarExt::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_action_area -->
Returns the action area of `self`.

# Returns

the action area
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_content_area -->
Returns the content area of `self`.

# Returns

the content area
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_message_type -->
Returns the message type of the message area.

# Returns

the message type of the message area.
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_revealed -->
Returns whether the info bar is currently revealed.

# Returns

the current value of the `InfoBar:revealed` property
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_show_close_button -->
Returns whether the widget will display a standard close button.

# Returns

`true` if the widget displays standard close button
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn response -->
Emits the “response” signal with the given `response_id`.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_default_response -->
Sets the last widget in the info bar’s action area with
the given response_id as the default widget for the dialog.
Pressing “Enter” normally activates the default widget.

Note that this function currently requires `self` to
be added to a widget hierarchy.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_message_type -->
Sets the message type of the message area.

GTK+ uses this type to determine how the message is displayed.
## `message_type`
a `MessageType`
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_response_sensitive -->
Calls gtk_widget_set_sensitive (widget, setting) for each
widget in the info bars’s action area with the given response_id.
A convenient way to sensitize/desensitize dialog buttons.
## `response_id`
a response ID
## `setting`
TRUE for sensitive
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_revealed -->
Sets the `InfoBar:revealed` property to `revealed`. Changing this will make
`self` reveal (`true`) or conceal (`false`) itself via a sliding transition.

Note: this does not show or hide `self` in the `Widget:visible` sense,
so revealing has no effect if `Widget:visible` is `false`.
## `revealed`
The new value of the property
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_show_close_button -->
If true, a standard close button is shown. When clicked it emits
the response `ResponseType::Close`.
## `setting`
`true` to include a close button
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user uses a keybinding to dismiss
the info bar.

The default binding for this signal is the Escape key.
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when an action widget is clicked or the application programmer
calls `InfoBarExt::response`. The `response_id` depends on which action
widget was clicked.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_property_message_type -->
The type of the message.

The type may be used to determine the appearance of the info bar.
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_property_message_type -->
The type of the message.

The type may be used to determine the appearance of the info bar.
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn get_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to include a standard close button.
<!-- trait InfoBarExt::fn set_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to include a standard close button.
<!-- enum InputPurpose -->
Describes primary purpose of the input widget. This information is
useful for on-screen keyboards and similar input methods to decide
which keys should be presented to the user.

Note that the purpose is not meant to impose a totally strict rule
about allowed characters, and does not replace input validation.
It is fine for an on-screen keyboard to let the user override the
character set restriction that is expressed by the purpose. The
application is expected to validate the entry contents, even if
it specified a purpose.

The difference between `InputPurpose::Digits` and
`InputPurpose::Number` is that the former accepts only digits
while the latter also some punctuation (like commas or points, plus,
minus) and “e” or “E” as in 3.14E+000.

This enumeration may be extended in the future; input methods should
interpret unknown values as “free form”.
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant FreeForm -->
Allow any character
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Alpha -->
Allow only alphabetic characters
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Digits -->
Allow only digits
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Number -->
Edited field expects numbers
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Phone -->
Edited field expects phone number
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Url -->
Edited field expects URL
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Email -->
Edited field expects email address
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Name -->
Edited field expects the name of a person
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Password -->
Like `InputPurpose::FreeForm`, but characters are hidden
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Pin -->
Like `InputPurpose::Digits`, but characters are hidden
<!-- enum Justification -->
Used for justifying the text inside a `Label` widget. (See also
``GtkAlignment``).
<!-- enum Justification::variant Left -->
The text is placed at the left edge of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Right -->
The text is placed at the right edge of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Center -->
The text is placed in the center of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Fill -->
The text is placed is distributed across the label.
<!-- struct Label -->
The `Label` widget displays a small amount of text. As the name
implies, most labels are used to label another widget such as a
`Button`, a `MenuItem`, or a `ComboBox`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
label
├── [selection]
├── [link]
┊
╰── [link]
```

`Label` has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
.dim-label, etc. In the `ShortcutsWindow`, labels are used wth the
.keycap style class.

If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.

If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
visited.

# `Label` as `Buildable`

The `Label` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
“start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify `pango::Attribute` values for
this label.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:

```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (button), label);
```

There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
already inside:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
```

To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
`Entry`, you have to point the label at the entry with
`LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
  GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
```

# Markup (styled text)

To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
[markup format][PangoMarkupFormat].

Here’s how to create a label with a small font:

```C
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
  gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
```

(See [complete documentation][PangoMarkupFormat] of available
tags in the Pango manual.)

The markup passed to `LabelExt::set_markup` must be valid; for example,
literal <, > and & characters must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.
If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
`LabelExt::set_markup`, you’ll want to escape it with
`g_markup_escape_text` or `g_markup_printf_escaped`.

Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the `pango::AttrList` on
a label; `LabelExt::set_attributes` may be a simpler way to set
attributes in some cases. Be careful though; `pango::AttrList` tends to
cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
to [0, `G_MAXINT`)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
end_index for a `pango::Attribute` requires knowledge of the exact string
being displayed, so translations will cause problems.

# Selectable labels

Labels can be made selectable with `LabelExt::set_selectable`.
Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information
— such as error messages — should be made selectable.

# Text layout # {`label`-text-layout}

A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
understood by Pango.

Labels can automatically wrap text if you call
`LabelExt::set_line_wrap`.

`LabelExt::set_justify` sets how the lines in a label align
with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole
aligns in its available space, see the `Widget:halign` and
`Widget:valign` properties.

The `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars` properties
can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or wrapped
labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.

Note that the interpretation of `Label:width-chars` and
`Label:max-width-chars` has changed a bit with the introduction of
[width-for-height geometry management.][geometry-management]

# Links

GTK+ supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition
to regular Pango markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML,
using the `<a>` with “href“, “title“ and “class“ attributes. GTK+ renders links
similar to the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined
text. The “title“ attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link. The “class“
attribute is used as style class on the CSS node for the link.

An example looks like this:


```C
const gchar *text =
"Go to the"
"<a href=\"http://www.gtk.org title=\"&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
"GTK+ website</a> for more...";
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
```

It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips with
the `Label::activate-link` signal and the `LabelExt::get_current_uri` function.

# Implements

[`LabelExt`](trait.LabelExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait LabelExt -->
Trait containing all `Label` methods.

# Implementors

[`Label`](struct.Label.html)
<!-- impl Label::fn new -->
Creates a new label with the given text inside it. You can
pass `None` to get an empty label widget.
## `str`
The text of the label

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- impl Label::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `Label`, containing the text in `str`.

If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are
underlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use
'__' (two underscores). The first underlined character represents a
keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic. The mnemonic key can be used
to activate another widget, chosen automatically, or explicitly using
`LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`.

If `LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget` is not called, then the first
activatable ancestor of the `Label` will be chosen as the mnemonic
widget. For instance, if the label is inside a button or menu item,
the button or menu item will automatically become the mnemonic widget
and be activated by the mnemonic.
## `str`
The text of the label, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_attributes -->
Gets the attribute list that was set on the label using
`LabelExt::set_attributes`, if any. This function does
not reflect attributes that come from the labels markup
(see `LabelExt::set_markup`). If you want to get the
effective attributes for the label, use
pango_layout_get_attribute (gtk_label_get_layout (label)).

# Returns

the attribute list, or `None`
 if none was set.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_current_uri -->
Returns the URI for the currently active link in the label.
The active link is the one under the mouse pointer or, in a
selectable label, the link in which the text cursor is currently
positioned.

This function is intended for use in a `Label::activate-link` handler
or for use in a `Widget::query-tooltip` handler.

# Returns

the currently active URI or `None` if there is none.
 The string is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed or modified.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_ellipsize -->
Returns the ellipsizing position of the label. See `LabelExt::set_ellipsize`.

# Returns

`pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_justify -->
Returns the justification of the label. See `LabelExt::set_justify`.

# Returns

`Justification`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. (See
`LabelExt::get_text`).

# Returns

the text of the label widget. This string is
 owned by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the label.
The layout is useful to e.g. convert text positions to
pixel positions, in combination with `LabelExt::get_layout_offsets`.
The returned layout is owned by the `self` so need not be
freed by the caller. The `self` is free to recreate its layout at
any time, so it should be considered read-only.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this label
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the label will draw the `pango::Layout`
representing the text in the label; useful to convert mouse events
into coordinates inside the `pango::Layout`, e.g. to take some action
if some part of the label is clicked. Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` functions you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_line_wrap -->
Returns whether lines in the label are automatically wrapped.
See `LabelExt::set_line_wrap`.

# Returns

`true` if the lines of the label are automatically wrapped.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_line_wrap_mode -->

`LabelExt::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the maximum width of the label in characters.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_mnemonic_keyval -->
If the label has been set so that it has an mnemonic key this function
returns the keyval used for the mnemonic accelerator. If there is no
mnemonic set up it returns `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`.

# Returns

GDK keyval usable for accelerators, or `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_mnemonic_widget -->
Retrieves the target of the mnemonic (keyboard shortcut) of this
label. See `LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`.

# Returns

the target of the label’s mnemonic,
 or `None` if none has been set and the default algorithm will be used.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value set by `LabelExt::set_selectable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can copy text from the label
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Gets the selected range of characters in the label, returning `true`
if there’s a selection.
## `start`
return location for start of selection, as a character offset
## `end`
return location for end of selection, as a character offset

# Returns

`true` if selection is non-empty
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_single_line_mode -->
Returns whether the label is in single line mode.

# Returns

`true` when the label is in single line mode.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_text -->
Fetches the text from a label widget, as displayed on the
screen. This does not include any embedded underlines
indicating mnemonics or Pango markup. (See `LabelExt::get_label`)

# Returns

the text in the label widget. This is the internal
 string used by the label, and must not be modified.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_track_visited_links -->
Returns whether the label is currently keeping track
of clicked links.

# Returns

`true` if clicked links are remembered
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_use_markup -->
Returns whether the label’s text is interpreted as marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See gtk_label_set_use_markup ().

# Returns

`true` if the label’s text will be parsed for markup.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns whether an embedded underline in the label indicates a
mnemonic. See `LabelExt::set_use_underline`.

# Returns

`true` whether an embedded underline in the label indicates
 the mnemonic accelerator keys.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired width of `self`, in characters. See
`LabelExt::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the width of the label in characters.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_xalign -->
Gets the `Label:xalign` property for `self`.

# Returns

the xalign property
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_yalign -->
Gets the `Label:yalign` property for `self`.

# Returns

the yalign property
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn select_region -->
Selects a range of characters in the label, if the label is selectable.
See `LabelExt::set_selectable`. If the label is not selectable,
this function has no effect. If `start_offset` or
`end_offset` are -1, then the end of the label will be substituted.
## `start_offset`
start offset (in characters not bytes)
## `end_offset`
end offset (in characters not bytes)
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
label text.

The attributes set with this function will be applied
and merged with any other attributes previously effected by way
of the `Label:use-underline` or `Label:use-markup` properties.
While it is not recommended to mix markup strings with manually set
attributes, if you must; know that the attributes will be applied
to the label after the markup string is parsed.
## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList`, or `None`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") to the text
if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_justify -->
Sets the alignment of the lines in the text of the label relative to
each other. `Justification::Left` is the default value when the widget is
first created with `Label::new`. If you instead want to set the
alignment of the label as a whole, use `WidgetExt::set_halign` instead.
`LabelExt::set_justify` has no effect on labels containing only a
single line.
## `jtype`
a `Justification`
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of the label. The label is interpreted as
including embedded underlines and/or Pango markup depending
on the values of the `Label:use-underline` and
`Label:use-markup` properties.
## `str`
the new text to set for the label
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_line_wrap -->
Toggles line wrapping within the `Label` widget. `true` makes it break
lines if text exceeds the widget’s size. `false` lets the text get cut off
by the edge of the widget if it exceeds the widget size.

Note that setting line wrapping to `true` does not make the label
wrap at its parent container’s width, because GTK+ widgets
conceptually can’t make their requisition depend on the parent
container’s size. For a label that wraps at a specific position,
set the label’s width using `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
## `wrap`
the setting
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_line_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see `LabelExt::set_line_wrap`) this controls how
the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word` which means
wrap on word boundaries.
## `wrap_mode`
the line wrapping mode
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_lines -->
Sets the number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited. This has no effect if the label is not wrapping
or ellipsized. Set this to -1 if you don’t want to limit the
number of lines.
## `lines`
the desired number of lines, or -1
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_markup -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat], setting the
label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results.

If the `str` is external data, you may need to escape it with
`g_markup_escape_text` or `g_markup_printf_escaped`:


```C
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
const char *str = "...";
const char *format = "<span style=\"italic\">\%s</span>";
char *markup;

markup = g_markup_printf_escaped (format, str);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), markup);
g_free (markup);
```

This function will set the `Label:use-markup` property to `true` as
a side effect.

If you set the label contents using the `Label:label` property you
should also ensure that you set the `Label:use-markup` property
accordingly.

See also: `LabelExt::set_text`
## `str`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_markup_with_mnemonic -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat],
setting the label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.

The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a markup string (see
 [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_max_width_chars -->
Sets the desired maximum width in characters of `self` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired maximum width, in characters.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_mnemonic_widget -->
If the label has been set so that it has an mnemonic key (using
i.e. `LabelExt::set_markup_with_mnemonic`,
`LabelExt::set_text_with_mnemonic`, `Label::new_with_mnemonic`
or the “use_underline” property) the label can be associated with a
widget that is the target of the mnemonic. When the label is inside
a widget (like a `Button` or a `Notebook` tab) it is
automatically associated with the correct widget, but sometimes
(i.e. when the target is a `Entry` next to the label) you need to
set it explicitly using this function.

The target widget will be accelerated by emitting the
`Widget`::mnemonic-activate signal on it. The default handler for
this signal will activate the widget if there are no mnemonic collisions
and toggle focus between the colliding widgets otherwise.
## `widget`
the target `Widget`, or `None` to unset
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_pattern -->
The pattern of underlines you want under the existing text within the
`Label` widget. For example if the current text of the label says
“FooBarBaz” passing a pattern of “___ ___” will underline
“Foo” and “Baz” but not “Bar”.
## `pattern`
The pattern as described above.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_selectable -->
Selectable labels allow the user to select text from the label, for
copy-and-paste.
## `setting`
`true` to allow selecting text in the label
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_single_line_mode -->
Sets whether the label is in single line mode.
## `single_line_mode`
`true` if the label should be in single line mode
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_text -->
Sets the text within the `Label` widget. It overwrites any text that
was there before.

This function will clear any previously set mnemonic accelerators, and
set the `Label:use-underline` property to `false` as a side effect.

This function will set the `Label:use-markup` property to `false`
as a side effect.

See also: `LabelExt::set_markup`
## `str`
The text you want to set
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_text_with_mnemonic -->
Sets the label’s text from the string `str`.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.
The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a string
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_track_visited_links -->
Sets whether the label should keep track of clicked
links (and use a different color for them).
## `track_links`
`true` to track visited links
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_use_markup -->
Sets whether the text of the label contains markup in
[Pango’s text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `LabelExt::set_markup`.
## `setting`
`true` if the label’s text should be parsed for markup.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text indicates the next character should be
used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `setting`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_width_chars -->
Sets the desired width in characters of `self` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired width, in characters.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_xalign -->
Sets the `Label:xalign` property for `self`.
## `xalign`
the new xalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_yalign -->
Sets the `Label:yalign` property for `self`.
## `yalign`
the new yalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn connect_activate_current_link -->
A [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user activates a link in the label.

Applications may also emit the signal with `g_signal_emit_by_name`
if they need to control activation of URIs programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal are all forms of the Enter key.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn connect_activate_link -->
The signal which gets emitted to activate a URI.
Applications may connect to it to override the default behaviour,
which is to call `gtk_show_uri_on_window`.
## `uri`
the URI that is activated

# Returns

`true` if the link has been activated
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn connect_copy_clipboard -->
The ::copy-clipboard signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to copy the selection to the clipboard.

The default binding for this signal is Ctrl-c.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `entry`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifer does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual characters/lines
- Ctrl-arrow key combinations move by words/paragraphs
- Home/End keys move to the ends of the buffer
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a `MovementStep`
## `count`
the number of `step` units to move
## `extend_selection`
`true` if the move should extend the selection
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn connect_populate_popup -->
The ::populate-popup signal gets emitted before showing the
context menu of the label. Note that only selectable labels
have context menus.

If you need to add items to the context menu, connect
to this signal and append your menuitems to the `menu`.
## `menu`
the menu that is being populated
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the label does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the label requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis "...". In particular, this
means that ellipsizing labels do not work well in notebook tabs, unless
the `Notebook` tab-expand child property is set to `true`. Other ways
to set a label's width are `WidgetExt::set_size_request` and
`LabelExt::set_width_chars`.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the label does

to set a label's width are `WidgetExt::set_size_request` and
`LabelExt::set_width_chars`.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_property_label -->
The contents of the label.

If the string contains [Pango XML markup][PangoMarkupFormat], you will
have to set the `Label:use-markup` property to `true` in order for the
label to display the markup attributes. See also `LabelExt::set_markup`
for a convenience function that sets both this property and the
`Label:use-markup` property at the same time.

If the string contains underlines acting as mnemonics, you will have to
set the `Label:use-underline` property to `true` in order for the label
to display them.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_property_label -->
The contents of the label.

If the string contains [Pango XML markup][PangoMarkupFormat], you will

<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_property_lines -->
The number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited. This property has no effect if the
label is not wrapping or ellipsized. Set this property to
-1 if you don't want to limit the number of lines.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_property_lines -->
The number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label

for details of how `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars`
determine the width of ellipsized and wrapped labels.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn get_property_single_line_mode -->
Whether the label is in single line mode. In single line mode,
the height of the label does not depend on the actual text, it
is always set to ascent + descent of the font. This can be an
advantage in situations where resizing the label because of text
changes would be distracting, e.g. in a statusbar.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_property_single_line_mode -->

how the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word`, which
means wrap on word boundaries.
<!-- trait LabelExt::fn set_property_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see the `Label:wrap` property) this controls
how the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word`, which
means wrap on word boundaries.

<!-- struct LayoutChild -->
`LayoutChild` is the base class for objects that are meant to hold
layout properties. If a `LayoutManager` has per-child properties,
like their packing type, or the horizontal and vertical span, or the
icon name, then the layout manager should use a `LayoutChild`
implementation to store those properties.

A `LayoutChild` instance is only ever valid while a widget is part
of a layout.

<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn set_property_child_widget -->
The widget that is associated to the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn get_property_layout_manager -->
The layout manager that created the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn set_property_layout_manager -->
The layout manager that created the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- struct LayoutManager -->
Layout managers are delegate classes that handle the preferred size
and the allocation of a container widget.

You typically subclass `LayoutManager` if you want to implement a
layout policy for the children of a widget, or if you want to determine
the size of a widget depending on its contents.

Each `Widget` can only have a `LayoutManager` instance associated to it
at any given time; it is possible, though, to replace the layout manager
instance using `WidgetExt::set_layout_manager`.

## Layout properties

A layout manager can expose properties for controlling the layout of
each child, by creating an object type derived from `LayoutChild`
and installing the properties on it as normal GObject properties.

Each `LayoutChild` instance storing the layout properties for a
specific child is created through the `LayoutManagerExt::get_layout_child`
method; a `LayoutManager` controls the creation of its `LayoutChild`
instances by overriding the `LayoutManagerClass`.`create_layout_child`
virtual function. The typical implementation should look like:


```C
static GtkLayoutChild *
create_layout_child (GtkLayoutManager *manager,
                     GtkWidget        *container,
                     GtkWidget        *child)
{
  return g_object_new (your_layout_child_get_type (),
                       "layout-manager", manager,
                       "child-widget", child,
                       NULL);
}
```

The `LayoutChild:layout-manager` and `LayoutChild:child-widget` properties
on the newly created `LayoutChild` instance are mandatory. The
`LayoutManager` will cache the newly created `LayoutChild` instance until
the widget is removed from its parent, or the parent removes the layout
manager.

Each `LayoutManager` instance creating a `LayoutChild` should use
`LayoutManagerExt::get_layout_child` every time it needs to query the
layout properties; each `LayoutChild` instance should call
`LayoutManagerExt::layout_changed` every time a property is updated, in
order to queue a new size measuring and allocation.

the baseline position of the `widget`, or -1
<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn get_layout_child -->
Retrieves a `LayoutChild` instance for the `LayoutManager`, creating
one if necessary.

The `child` widget must be a child of the widget using `self`.

The `LayoutChild` instance is owned by the `LayoutManager`, and is
guaranteed to exist as long as `child` is a child of the `Widget` using
the given `LayoutManager`.
## `child`

response to changes to their layout management policies.
<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn measure -->
Measures the size of the `widget` using `self`, for the
given `orientation` and size.

See [`Widget`'s geometry management section][geometry-management] for
more details.
## `widget`
the `Widget` using `self`
## `orientation`
the orientation to measure
## `for_size`
Size for the opposite of `orientation`; for instance, if
 the `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal`, this is the height
 of the widget; if the `orientation` is `Orientation::Vertical`, this
 is the width of the widget. This allows to measure the height for the
 given width, and the width for the given height. Use -1 if the size
 is not known
## `minimum`
the minimum size for the given size and
 orientation
## `natural`
the natural, or preferred size for the
 given size and orientation
## `minimum_baseline`
the baseline position for the
 minimum size
## `natural_baseline`
the baseline position for the
 natural size
<!-- struct LevelBar -->
The `LevelBar` is a bar widget that can be used
as a level indicator. Typical use cases are displaying the strength
of a password, or showing the charge level of a battery.

Use `LevelBarExt::set_value` to set the current value, and
`LevelBarExt::add_offset_value` to set the value offsets at which
the bar will be considered in a different state. GTK will add a few
offsets by default on the level bar: `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW`,
`GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_HIGH` and `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_FULL`, with
values 0.25, 0.75 and 1.0 respectively.

Note that it is your responsibility to update preexisting offsets
when changing the minimum or maximum value. GTK+ will simply clamp
them to the new range.

## Adding a custom offset on the bar


```C

static GtkWidget *
create_level_bar (void)
{
  GtkWidget *widget;
  GtkLevelBar *bar;

  widget = gtk_level_bar_new ();
  bar = GTK_LEVEL_BAR (widget);

  // This changes the value of the default low offset

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar,
                                  GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
                                  0.10);

  // This adds a new offset to the bar; the application will
  // be able to change its color CSS like this:
  //
  // levelbar block.my-offset {
  //   background-color: magenta;
  //   border-style: solid;
  //   border-color: black;
  //   border-style: 1px;
  // }

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar, "my-offset", 0.60);

  return widget;
}
```

The default interval of values is between zero and one, but it’s possible to
modify the interval using `LevelBarExt::set_min_value` and
`LevelBarExt::set_max_value`. The value will be always drawn in proportion to
the admissible interval, i.e. a value of 15 with a specified interval between
10 and 20 is equivalent to a value of 0.5 with an interval between 0 and 1.
When `LevelBarMode::Discrete` is used, the bar level is rendered
as a finite number of separated blocks instead of a single one. The number
of blocks that will be rendered is equal to the number of units specified by
the admissible interval.

For instance, to build a bar rendered with five blocks, it’s sufficient to
set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 5 after changing the indicator
mode to discrete.

`LevelBar` was introduced in GTK+ 3.6.

# `LevelBar` as `Buildable`

The `LevelBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<offsets>` element, which can contain any number of `<offset>` elements,
each of which must have name and value attributes.

# CSS nodes


```plain
levelbar[.discrete]
╰── trough
    ├── block.filled.level-name
    ┊
    ├── block.empty
    ┊
```

`LevelBar` has a main CSS node with name levelbar and one of the style
classes .discrete or .continuous and a subnode with name trough. Below the
trough node are a number of nodes with name block and style class .filled
or .empty. In continuous mode, there is exactly one node of each, in discrete
mode, the number of filled and unfilled nodes corresponds to blocks that are
drawn. The block.filled nodes also get a style class .level-name corresponding
to the level for the current value.

In horizontal orientation, the nodes are always arranged from left to right,
regardless of text direction.

<!-- struct LinkButton -->
A `LinkButton` is a `Button` with a hyperlink, similar to the one
used by web browsers, which triggers an action when clicked. It is useful
to show quick links to resources.

A link button is created by calling either `LinkButton::new` or
`LinkButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, the URI you pass
to the constructor is used as a label for the widget.

The URI bound to a `LinkButton` can be set specifically using
`LinkButtonExt::set_uri`, and retrieved using `LinkButtonExt::get_uri`.

By default, `LinkButton` calls `gtk_show_uri_on_window` when the button is
clicked. This behaviour can be overridden by connecting to the
`LinkButton::activate-link` signal and returning `true` from the
signal handler.

# CSS nodes

`LinkButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .link style class.

points. The button becomes visited when it is clicked. If the URI
is changed on the button, the “visited” state is unset again.

The state may also be changed using `LinkButtonExt::set_visited`.

# Returns

`true` if the link has been visited, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn set_uri -->
Sets `uri` as the URI where the `LinkButton` points. As a side-effect
this unsets the “visited” state of the button.
## `uri`
a valid URI
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn set_visited -->
Sets the “visited” state of the URI where the `LinkButton`
points. See `LinkButtonExt::get_visited` for more details.
## `visited`
the new “visited” state
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn connect_activate_link -->
The ::activate-link signal is emitted each time the `LinkButton`
has been clicked.

The default handler will call `gtk_show_uri_on_window` with the URI stored inside
the `LinkButton:uri` property.

To override the default behavior, you can connect to the ::activate-link
signal and stop the propagation of the signal by returning `true` from
your handler.
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn get_property_uri -->
The URI bound to this button.
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn set_property_uri -->
The URI bound to this button.
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn get_property_visited -->
The 'visited' state of this button. A visited link is drawn in a
different color.
<!-- trait LinkButtonExt::fn set_property_visited -->
The 'visited' state of this button. A visited link is drawn in a
different color.
<!-- struct ListBox -->
A `ListBox` is a vertical container that contains `ListBoxRow`
children. These rows can by dynamically sorted and filtered, and
headers can be added dynamically depending on the row content.
It also allows keyboard and mouse navigation and selection like
a typical list.

Using `ListBox` is often an alternative to `TreeView`, especially
when the list contents has a more complicated layout than what is allowed
by a `CellRenderer`, or when the contents is interactive (i.e. has a
button in it).

Although a `ListBox` must have only `ListBoxRow` children you can
add any kind of widget to it via `ContainerExt::add`, and a `ListBoxRow`
widget will automatically be inserted between the list and the widget.

``GtkListBoxRows`` can be marked as activatable or selectable. If a row
is activatable, `ListBox::row-activated` will be emitted for it when
the user tries to activate it. If it is selectable, the row will be marked
as selected when the user tries to select it.

The `ListBox` widget was added in GTK+ 3.10.

# CSS nodes


```plain
list[.separators]
╰── row[.activatable]
```

`ListBox` uses a single CSS node named list. It may carry the .separators style
class, when the `ListBox::show-separators` property is set. Each `ListBoxRow` uses
a single CSS node named row. The row nodes get the .activatable
style class added when appropriate.

<!-- trait ListBoxExt -->
Trait containing all `ListBox` methods.

# Implementors

[`ListBox`](struct.ListBox.html)
<!-- impl ListBox::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBox` container.

# Returns

a new `ListBox`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn bind_model -->
Binds `model` to `self`.

If `self` was already bound to a model, that previous binding is
destroyed.

The contents of `self` are cleared and then filled with widgets that
represent items from `model`. `self` is updated whenever `model` changes.
If `model` is `None`, `self` is left empty.

It is undefined to add or remove widgets directly (for example, with
`ListBoxExt::insert` or `ContainerExt::add`) while `self` is bound to a
model.

Note that using a model is incompatible with the filtering and sorting
functionality in `ListBox`. When using a model, filtering and sorting
should be implemented by the model.
## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to be bound to `self`
## `create_widget_func`
a function that creates widgets for items
 or `None` in case you also passed `None` as `model`
## `user_data`
user data passed to `create_widget_func`
## `user_data_free_func`
function for freeing `user_data`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn drag_highlight_row -->
This is a helper function for implementing DnD onto a `ListBox`.
The passed in `row` will be highlighted via `WidgetExt::drag_highlight`,
and any previously highlighted row will be unhighlighted.

The row will also be unhighlighted when the widget gets
a drag leave event.
## `row`
a `ListBoxRow`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn drag_unhighlight_row -->
If a row has previously been highlighted via `ListBoxExt::drag_highlight_row`
it will have the highlight removed.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_activate_on_single_click -->
Returns whether rows activate on single clicks.

# Returns

`true` if rows are activated on single click, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_adjustment -->
Gets the adjustment (if any) that the widget uses to
for vertical scrolling.

# Returns

the adjustment
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_row_at_index -->
Gets the n-th child in the list (not counting headers).
If `_index` is negative or larger than the number of items in the
list, `None` is returned.
## `index_`
the index of the row

# Returns

the child `Widget` or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_row_at_y -->
Gets the row at the `y` position.
## `y`
position

# Returns

the row or `None`
 in case no row exists for the given y coordinate.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_selected_row -->
Gets the selected row.

Note that the box may allow multiple selection, in which
case you should use `ListBoxExt::selected_foreach` to
find all selected rows.

# Returns

the selected row
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_selected_rows -->
Creates a list of all selected children.

# Returns


 A `glib::List` containing the `Widget` for each selected child.
 Free with `glib::List::free` when done.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_selection_mode -->
Gets the selection mode of the listbox.

# Returns

a `SelectionMode`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn get_show_separators -->
Returns whether the list box should show separators
between rows.

# Returns

`true` if the list box shows separators
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn insert -->
Insert the `child` into the `self` at `position`. If a sort function is
set, the widget will actually be inserted at the calculated position and
this function has the same effect of `ContainerExt::add`.

If `position` is -1, or larger than the total number of items in the
`self`, then the `child` will be appended to the end.
## `child`
the `Widget` to add
## `position`
the position to insert `child` in
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn invalidate_filter -->
Update the filtering for all rows. Call this when result
of the filter function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor. For instance, this would be used
if the filter function just looked for a specific search
string and the entry with the search string has changed.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn invalidate_headers -->
Update the separators for all rows. Call this when result
of the header function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn invalidate_sort -->
Update the sorting for all rows. Call this when result
of the sort function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn prepend -->
Prepend a widget to the list. If a sort function is set, the widget will
actually be inserted at the calculated position and this function has the
same effect of `ContainerExt::add`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to add
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn select_all -->
Select all children of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn select_row -->
Make `row` the currently selected row.
## `row`
The row to select or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected child.

Note that the selection cannot be modified from within this function.
## `func`
the function to call for each selected child
## `data`
user data to pass to the function
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->
If `single` is `true`, rows will be activated when you click on them,
otherwise you need to double-click.
## `single`
a boolean
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment (if any) that the widget uses to
for vertical scrolling. For instance, this is used
to get the page size for PageUp/Down key handling.

In the normal case when the `self` is packed inside
a `ScrolledWindow` the adjustment from that will
be picked up automatically, so there is no need
to manually do that.
## `adjustment`
the adjustment, or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_filter_func -->
By setting a filter function on the `self` one can decide dynamically which
of the rows to show. For instance, to implement a search function on a list that
filters the original list to only show the matching rows.

The `filter_func` will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) or
when `ListBoxExt::invalidate_filter` is called.

Note that using a filter function is incompatible with using a model
(see `ListBoxExt::bind_model`).
## `filter_func`
callback that lets you filter which rows to show
## `user_data`
user data passed to `filter_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_header_func -->
By setting a header function on the `self` one can dynamically add headers
in front of rows, depending on the contents of the row and its position in the list.
For instance, one could use it to add headers in front of the first item of a
new kind, in a list sorted by the kind.

The `update_header` can look at the current header widget using `ListBoxRowExt::get_header`
and either update the state of the widget as needed, or set a new one using
`ListBoxRowExt::set_header`. If no header is needed, set the header to `None`.

Note that you may get many calls `update_header` to this for a particular row when e.g.
changing things that don’t affect the header. In this case it is important for performance
to not blindly replace an existing header with an identical one.

The `update_header` function will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) and when
the row before changes (either by `ListBoxRowExt::changed` on the previous row, or when
the previous row becomes a different row). It is also called for all rows when
`ListBoxExt::invalidate_headers` is called.
## `update_header`
callback that lets you add row headers
## `user_data`
user data passed to `update_header`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_placeholder -->
Sets the placeholder widget that is shown in the list when
it doesn't display any visible children.
## `placeholder`
a `Widget` or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_selection_mode -->
Sets how selection works in the listbox.
See `SelectionMode` for details.
## `mode`
The `SelectionMode`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_show_separators -->
Sets whether the list box should show separators
between rows.
## `show_separators`
`true` to show separators
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn set_sort_func -->
By setting a sort function on the `self` one can dynamically reorder the rows
of the list, based on the contents of the rows.

The `sort_func` will be called for each row after the call, and will continue to
be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) and when
`ListBoxExt::invalidate_sort` is called.

Note that using a sort function is incompatible with using a model
(see `ListBoxExt::bind_model`).
## `sort_func`
the sort function
## `user_data`
user data passed to `sort_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn unselect_all -->
Unselect all children of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn unselect_row -->
Unselects a single row of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.
## `row`
the row to unselected
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn connect_row_activated -->
The ::row-activated signal is emitted when a row has been activated by the user.
## `row`
the activated row
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn connect_row_selected -->
The ::row-selected signal is emitted when a new row is selected, or
(with a `None` `row`) when the selection is cleared.

When the `box_` is using `SelectionMode::Multiple`, this signal will not
give you the full picture of selection changes, and you should use
the `ListBox::selected-rows-changed` signal instead.
## `row`
the selected row
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn connect_select_all -->
The ::select-all signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to select all children of the box, if the selection
mode permits it.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-a.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn connect_selected_rows_changed -->
The ::selected-rows-changed signal is emitted when the
set of selected rows changes.
<!-- trait ListBoxExt::fn connect_unselect_all -->
The ::unselect-all signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to unselect all children of the box, if the selection
mode permits it.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-Shift-a.

<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBoxRow`, to be used as a child of a `ListBox`.

# Returns

a new `ListBoxRow`
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting, filtering and headers.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the row functions. For instance, if the list is
mirroring some external data set, and *two* rows changed in the
external data set then when you call `ListBoxRowExt::changed`
on the first row the sort function must only read the new data
for the first of the two changed rows, otherwise the resorting
of the rows will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model you have to duplicate the data that affects the listbox
row functions into the row widgets themselves. Another alternative
is to call `ListBoxExt::invalidate_sort` on any model change,
but that is more expensive.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_activatable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property
for this row.

# Returns

`true` if the row is activatable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_header -->
Returns the current header of the `self`. This can be used
in a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc`` to see if there is a header
set already, and if so to update the state of it.

# Returns

the current header, or `None` if none
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_index -->
Gets the current index of the `self` in its `ListBox` container.

# Returns

the index of the `self`, or -1 if the `self` is not in a listbox
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property
for this row.

# Returns

`true` if the row is selectable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn is_selected -->
Returns whether the child is currently selected in its
`ListBox` container.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is selected
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_activatable -->
Set the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property for this row.
## `activatable`
`true` to mark the row as activatable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_header -->
Sets the current header of the `self`. This is only allowed to be called
from a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc``. It will replace any existing
header in the row, and be shown in front of the row in the listbox.
## `header`
the header, or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_selectable -->
Set the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property for this row.
## `selectable`
`true` to mark the row as selectable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn connect_activate -->
This is a keybinding signal, which will cause this row to be activated.

If you want to be notified when the user activates a row (by key or not),
use the `ListBox::row-activated` signal on the row’s parent `ListBox`.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_property_activatable -->
The property determines whether the `ListBox::row-activated`
signal will be emitted for this row.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_property_activatable -->
The property determines whether the `ListBox::row-activated`
signal will be emitted for this row.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_property_selectable -->
The property determines whether this row can be selected.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_property_selectable -->
The property determines whether this row can be selected.
<!-- struct ListStore -->
The `ListStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequentialy,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view.
Finally, it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk3-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

The `ListStore` can accept most GObject types as a column type, though
it can’t accept all custom types. Internally, it will keep a copy of
data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer). Columns that
accept `GObjects` are handled a little differently. The
`ListStore` will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
value. As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
application writer to call `TreeModel::row_changed` to emit the
`TreeModel::row_changed` signal. This most commonly affects lists with
``GdkTextures`` stored.

An example for creating a simple list store:

```C
enum {
  COLUMN_STRING,
  COLUMN_INT,
  COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

{
  GtkListStore *list_store;
  GtkTreePath *path;
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  gint i;

  list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                   G_TYPE_STRING,
                                   G_TYPE_INT,
                                   G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
      gchar *some_data;

      some_data = get_some_data (i);

      // Add a new row to the model
      gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
      gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                          COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
                          COLUMN_INT, i,
                          COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
                          -1);

      // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
      // we free some_data.
      g_free (some_data);
    }

  // Modify a particular row
  path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
  gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),
                           &iter,
                           path);
  gtk_tree_path_free (path);
  gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                      COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,
                      -1);
}
```

# Performance Considerations

Internally, the `ListStore` was implemented with a linked list with
a tail pointer prior to GTK+ 2.6. As a result, it was fast at data
insertion and deletion, and not fast at random data access. The
`ListStore` sets the `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag, which means
that ``GtkTreeIters`` can be cached while the row exists. Thus, if
access to a particular row is needed often and your code is expected to
run on older versions of GTK+, it is worth keeping the iter around.

# Atomic Operations

It is important to note that only the methods
`GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` and `GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_valuesv`
are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
values filled in in a single operation with regard to `TreeModel` signaling.
In contrast, using e.g. `GtkListStoreExt::append` and then `GtkListStoreExt::set`
will first create a row, which triggers the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal
on `ListStore`. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
connecting to `TreeModel::row-inserted` on this particular store should be prepared
for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
if you are wrapping the `ListStore` inside a `TreeModelFilter` and are
using a ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``. Using any of the non-atomic operations
to append rows to the `ListStore` will cause the
``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc`` to be visited with an empty row first; the
function must be prepared for that.

# `ListStore` as `Buildable`

The `ListStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
`<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.

Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
is to separate the two, as far as possible.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:

```C
<object class="GtkListStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
  <data>
    <row>
      <col id="0">John</col>
      <col id="1">Doe</col>
      <col id="2">25</col>
    </row>
    <row>
      <col id="0">Johan</col>
      <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
      <col id="2">50</col>
    </row>
  </data>
</object>
```

<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt -->
Trait containing all `ListStore` methods.

# Implementors

[`ListStore`](struct.ListStore.html)
<!-- impl ListStore::fn new -->
Creates a new list store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_list_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_TEXTURE);` will create a new `ListStore` with three columns, of type
int, string and `gdk::Texture`, respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn newv -->
Non-vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from the list store.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows on the list,
then the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to the beginning of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to
this new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill
in values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows in the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with the
values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_list_store_insert_with_values (list_store, iter, position...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
static void
insert_value (GtkListStore *list_store,
              GtkTreeIter  *iter,
              int           position)
{
  gtk_list_store_insert (list_store, iter, position);
  gtk_list_store_set (list_store,
                      iter
                      // ...
                      );
}
```
with the difference that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and, if the list store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted list store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing
 rows
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `ListStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the start of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the end of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepend row
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn remove -->
Removes the given row from the list store. After being removed,
`iter` is set to be the next valid row, or invalidated if it pointed
to the last row in `self`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is valid, `false` if not.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn reorder -->
Reorders `self` to follow the order indicated by `new_order`. Note that
this function only works with unsorted stores.
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new
 position of each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`. It must have
 exactly as many items as the list store’s length.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write `gtk_list_store_set (store, iter,
0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
row iterator
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from `ListStore`,

## `column`
column number to modify
## `value`
new value for the cell
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set_valuesv -->
A variant of `GtkListStoreExt::set_valist` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings and in case the number of columns to
change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn swap -->

unsorted stores.
## `a`
A `TreeIter`.
## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct LockButton -->
`LockButton` is a widget that can be used in control panels or
preference dialogs to allow users to obtain and revoke authorizations
needed to operate the controls. The required authorization is represented
by a `gio::Permission` object. Concrete implementations of `gio::Permission` may use
PolicyKit or some other authorization framework. To obtain a PolicyKit-based
`gio::Permission`, use `polkit_permission_new`.

If the user is not currently allowed to perform the action, but can obtain
the permission, the widget looks like this:

![](lockbutton-locked.png)

and the user can click the button to request the permission. Depending
on the platform, this may pop up an authentication dialog or ask the user
to authenticate in some other way. Once the user has obtained the permission,
the widget changes to this:

![](lockbutton-unlocked.png)

and the permission can be dropped again by clicking the button. If the user
is not able to obtain the permission at all, the widget looks like this:

![](lockbutton-sorry.png)

If the user has the permission and cannot drop it, the button is hidden.

The text (and tooltips) that are shown in the various cases can be adjusted
with the `LockButton:text-lock`, `LockButton:text-unlock`,
`LockButton:tooltip-lock`, `LockButton:tooltip-unlock` and
`LockButton:tooltip-not-authorized` properties.

`MapListModel` is a list model that takes a list model and maps the items
in that model to different items according to a ``GtkMapListModelMapFunc``.

FIXME: Add useful examples here, like turning `gio::File` into `gio::FileInfo` or ``GdkPixmap``.

`MapListModel` will attempt to discard the mapped objects as soon as they are no
longer needed and recreate them if necessary.

Sets the function used to map items. The function will be called whenever
an item needs to be mapped and must return the item to use for the given
input item.

Note that `MapListModel` may call this function multiple times on the
same item, because it may delete items it doesn't need anymore.

GTK makes no effort to ensure that `map_func` conforms to the item type
of `self`. It assumes that the caller knows what they are doing and the map
function returns items of the appropriate type.

<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn ended -->
Pauses the media stream and marks it as ended. This is a hint only, calls
to `MediaStream`.`play` may still happen.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn error -->
Sets `self` into an error state using a `printf`-style format string.

This is a utility function that calls `MediaStream::gerror`. See
that function for details.
## `domain`
error domain
## `code`
error code
## `format`

<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn error_valist -->
Sets `self` into an error state using a `printf`-style format string.

This is a utility function that calls `MediaStream::gerror`. See
that function for details.
## `domain`
error domain
## `code`
error code
## `format`
`printf`-style format for error message
## `args`
`va_list` of parameters for the message format
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn gerror -->
Sets `self` into an error state. This will pause the stream
(you can check for an error via `MediaStreamExt::get_error` in
your `MediaStream`.`pause` implementation), abort pending seeks
and mark the stream as prepared.

if the stream is already in an error state, this call will be ignored
and the existing error will be retained.
FIXME: Or do we want to set the new error?

To unset an error, the stream must be reset via a call to
`MediaStreamExt::unprepared`.
## `error`
the `glib::Error` to set
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_duration -->
Gets the duration of the stream. If the duration is not known,
0 will be returned.

# Returns

the duration of the stream or 0 if not known.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_ended -->
Returns whether the streams playback is finished.

# Returns

`true` if playback is finished
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_error -->
If the stream is in an error state, returns the `glib::Error` explaining that state.
Any type of error can be reported here depending on the implementation of the
media stream.

A media stream in an error cannot be operated on, calls like
`MediaStreamExt::play` or `MediaStreamExt::seek` will not have any effect.

`MediaStream` itself does not provide a way to unset an error, but
implementations may provide options. For example, a `MediaFile` will unset
errors when a new source is set with ie `MediaFileExt::set_file`.

# Returns

`None` if not in an error state or
 the `glib::Error` of the stream
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_loop -->
Returns whether the stream is set to loop. See
`MediaStreamExt::set_loop` for details.

# Returns

`true` if the stream should loop
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_muted -->
Returns whether the audio for the stream is muted.
See `MediaStreamExt::set_muted` for details.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is muted
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_playing -->
Return whether the stream is currently playing.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is playing
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_timestamp -->

<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn has_audio -->
Returns whether the stream has audio.

# Returns

`true` if the stream has audio
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn has_video -->
Returns whether the stream has video.

# Returns

`true` if the stream has video
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_prepared -->
Returns whether the stream has finished initializing and existence of
audio and video is known.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is prepared
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_seekable -->
Checks if a stream may be seekable.

This is meant to be a hint. Streams may not allow seeking even if
this function returns `true`. However, if this function returns
`false`, streams are guaranteed to not be seekable and user interfaces
may hide controls that allow seeking.

It is allowed to call `MediaStreamExt::seek` on a non-seekable
stream, though it will not do anything.

# Returns

`true` if the stream may support seeking
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_seeking -->
Checks if there is currently a seek operation going on.

# Returns

`true` if a seek operation is ongoing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn pause -->
Pauses playback of the stream. If the stream
is not playing, do nothing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn play -->
Starts playing the stream. If the stream
is in error or already playing, do nothing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn prepared -->
Called by `MediaStream` implementations to advertise the stream
being ready to play and providing details about the stream.

Note that the arguments are hints. If the stream implementation
cannot determine the correct values, it is better to err on the
side of caution and return `true`. User interfaces will use those
values to determine what controls to show.

This function may not be called again until the stream has been
reset via `MediaStreamExt::unprepared`.
## `has_audio`
`true` if the stream should advertise audio support
## `has_video`
`true` if the stream should advertise video support
## `seekable`
`true` if the stream should advertise seekability
## `duration`
The duration of the stream or 0 if unknown
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn realize -->
Called by users to attach the media stream to a `gdk::Surface` they manage.
The stream can then access the resources of `surface` for its rendering
purposes. In particular, media streams might want to create
``GdkGLContexts`` or sync to the `gdk::FrameClock`.

Whoever calls this function is responsible for calling
`MediaStreamExt::unrealize` before either the stream or `surface` get
destroyed.

Multiple calls to this function may happen from different users of the
video, even with the same `surface`. Each of these calls must be followed
by its own call to `MediaStreamExt::unrealize`.

It is not required to call this function to make a media stream work.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek -->
Start a seek operation on `self` to `timestamp`. If `timestamp` is out of range,
it will be clamped.

Seek operations may not finish instantly. While a seek operation is
in process, the `MediaStream`:seeking property will be set.

When calling `MediaStreamExt::seek` during an ongoing seek operation,
the new seek wil override any pending seek.
## `timestamp`
timestamp to seek to.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek_failed -->
Ends a seek operation started via `MediaStream`.`seek` as a failure.
This will not cause an error on the stream and will assume that
playback continues as if no seek had happened.

See `MediaStreamExt::seek_success` for the other way of
ending a seek.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek_success -->
Ends a seek operation started via `MediaStream`.`seek` successfully.
This function will unset the `MediaStream`:ended property if it was
set.

See `MediaStreamExt::seek_failed` for the other way of
ending a seek.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_loop -->
Sets whether the stream should loop, ie restart playback from
the beginning instead of stopping at the end.

Not all streams may support looping, in particular non-seekable
streams. Those streams will ignore the loop setting and just end.
## `loop_`
`true` if the stream should loop
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_muted -->
Sets whether the audio stream should be muted. Muting a stream will
cause no audio to be played, but it does not modify the volume.
This means that muting and then unmuting the stream will restore
the volume settings.

If the stream has no audio, calling this function will still work
but it will not have an audible effect.
## `muted`
`true` if the stream should be muted
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_playing -->
Starts or pauses playback of the stream.
## `playing`
whether to start or pause playback
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_volume -->
Sets the volume of the audio stream. This function call will work even if
the stream is muted.

The given `volume` should range from 0.0 for silence to 1.0 for as loud as
possible. Values outside of this range will be clamped to the nearest
value.

If the stream has no audio or is muted, calling this function will still
work but it will not have an immediate audible effect. When the stream is
unmuted, the new volume setting will take effect.
## `volume`
New volume of the stream from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn unprepared -->
Resets a given media stream implementation. `MediaStreamExt::prepared`
can now be called again.

This function will also reset any error state the stream was in.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn unrealize -->
Undoes a previous call to `MediaStreamExt::realize` and causes
the stream to release all resources it had allocated from `surface`.
## `surface`
the `gdk::Surface` the stream was realized with
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn update -->
Media stream implementations should regularly call this function to
update the timestamp reported by the stream. It is up to
implementations to call this at the frequency they deem appropriate.
## `timestamp`
the new timestamp
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_duration -->
The stream's duration in microseconds or 0 if unknown.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_ended -->
Set when playback has finished.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_error -->
`None` for a properly working stream or the `glib::Error` that the stream is in.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_error -->
`None` for a properly working stream or the `glib::Error` that the stream is in.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_has_audio -->

audio and video is known.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_seekable -->
Set unless the stream is known to not support seeking.

Set while a seek is in progress.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_timestamp -->
The current presentation timestamp in microseconds.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_volume -->

Volume of the audio stream.
<!-- struct Menu -->
A `Menu` is a `MenuShell` that implements a drop down menu
consisting of a list of `MenuItem` objects which can be navigated
and activated by the user to perform application functions.

A `Menu` is most commonly dropped down by activating a
`MenuItem` in a `MenuBar` or popped up by activating a
`MenuItem` in another `Menu`.

A `Menu` can also be popped up by activating a `ComboBox`.
Other composite widgets such as the `Notebook` can pop up a
`Menu` as well.

Applications can display a `Menu` as a popup menu by calling one of the
gtk_menu_popup_*() function. The example below shows how an application can
pop up a menu when the 3rd mouse button is pressed.

## Connecting the popup signal handler.


```C
  // connect our handler which will popup the menu
  gesture = gtk_gesture_multi_press_new (window);
  gtk_gesture_single_set_button (GTK_GESTURE_SINGLE (gesture),
                                 GDK_BUTTON_SECONDARY);
  g_signal_connect (gesture, "begin", G_CALLBACK (my_popup_handler), menu);
```

## Signal handler which displays a popup menu.


```C
static void
my_popup_handler (GtkGesture       *gesture,
                  GdkEventSequence *sequence
                  gpointer          data)
{
  GtkMenu *menu = data;

<!-- trait GtkMenuExt -->
Trait containing all `Menu` methods.

# Implementors

[`Menu`](struct.Menu.html)
<!-- impl Menu::fn new -->
Creates a new `Menu`

# Returns

a new `Menu`
<!-- impl Menu::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a `Menu` and populates it with menu items and
submenus according to `model`.

The created menu items are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the menu belongs - typically
by means of being attached to a widget (see `GtkMenuExt::attach_to_widget`)
that is contained within the ``GtkApplicationWindows`` widget hierarchy.

Actions can also be added using `WidgetExt::insert_action_group` on the menu's
attach widget or on any of its parent widgets.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

a new `Menu`
<!-- impl Menu::fn get_for_attach_widget -->
Returns a list of the menus which are attached to this widget.
This list is owned by GTK+ and must not be modified.
## `widget`
a `Widget`

# Returns

the list
 of menus attached to his widget.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn attach_to_widget -->
Attaches the menu to the widget and provides a callback function
that will be invoked when the menu calls `GtkMenuExt::detach` during
its destruction.

If the menu is attached to the widget then it will be destroyed
when the widget is destroyed, as if it was a child widget.
An attached menu will also move between screens correctly if the
widgets moves between screens.
## `attach_widget`
the `Widget` that the menu will be attached to
## `detacher`
the user supplied callback function
 that will be called when the menu calls `GtkMenuExt::detach`
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn detach -->
Detaches the menu from the widget to which it had been attached.
This function will call the callback function, `detacher`, provided
when the `GtkMenuExt::attach_to_widget` function was called.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_accel_group -->
Gets the `AccelGroup` which holds global accelerators for the
menu. See `GtkMenuExt::set_accel_group`.

# Returns

the `AccelGroup` associated with the menu
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_accel_path -->
Retrieves the accelerator path set on the menu.

# Returns

the accelerator path set on the menu.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_active -->
Returns the selected menu item from the menu. This is used by the
`ComboBox`.

# Returns

the `MenuItem` that was last selected
 in the menu. If a selection has not yet been made, the
 first menu item is selected.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_attach_widget -->
Returns the `Widget` that the menu is attached to.

# Returns

the `Widget` that the menu is attached to
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_monitor -->
Retrieves the number of the monitor on which to show the menu.

# Returns

the number of the monitor on which the menu should
 be popped up or -1, if no monitor has been set
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_reserve_toggle_size -->
Returns whether the menu reserves space for toggles and
icons, regardless of their actual presence.

# Returns

Whether the menu reserves toggle space
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn place_on_monitor -->
Places `self` on the given monitor.
## `monitor`
the monitor to place the menu on
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn popdown -->
Removes the menu from the screen.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn popup_at_pointer -->
Displays `self` and makes it available for selection.

See gtk_menu_popup_at_widget () to pop up a menu at a widget.
gtk_menu_popup_at_rect () also allows you to position a menu at an arbitrary
rectangle.

`self` will be positioned at the pointer associated with `trigger_event`.

Properties that influence the behaviour of this function are
`Menu:anchor-hints`, `Menu:rect-anchor-dx`, `Menu:rect-anchor-dy`, and
`Menu:menu-type-hint`. Connect to the `Menu::popped-up` signal to find
out how it was actually positioned.
## `trigger_event`
the `gdk::Event` that initiated this request or
 `None` if it's the current event
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn popup_at_rect -->
Displays `self` and makes it available for selection.

See gtk_menu_popup_at_widget () and gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer (), which
handle more common cases for popping up menus.

`self` will be positioned at `rect`, aligning their anchor points. `rect` is
relative to the top-left corner of `rect_surface`. `rect_anchor` and
`menu_anchor` determine anchor points on `rect` and `self` to pin together.
`self` can optionally be offset by `Menu:rect-anchor-dx` and
`Menu:rect-anchor-dy`.

Anchors should be specified under the assumption that the text direction is
left-to-right; they will be flipped horizontally automatically if the text
direction is right-to-left.

Other properties that influence the behaviour of this function are
`Menu:anchor-hints` and `Menu:menu-type-hint`. Connect to the
`Menu::popped-up` signal to find out how it was actually positioned.
## `rect_surface`
the `gdk::Surface` `rect` is relative to
## `rect`
the `gdk::Rectangle` to align `self` with
## `rect_anchor`
the point on `rect` to align with `self`'s anchor point
## `menu_anchor`
the point on `self` to align with `rect`'s anchor point
## `trigger_event`
the `gdk::Event` that initiated this request or
 `None` if it's the current event
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn popup_at_widget -->
Displays `self` and makes it available for selection.

See gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer () to pop up a menu at the master pointer.
gtk_menu_popup_at_rect () also allows you to position a menu at an arbitrary
rectangle.

![](popup-anchors.png)

`self` will be positioned at `widget`, aligning their anchor points.
`widget_anchor` and `menu_anchor` determine anchor points on `widget` and `self`
to pin together. `self` can optionally be offset by `Menu:rect-anchor-dx`
and `Menu:rect-anchor-dy`.

Anchors should be specified under the assumption that the text direction is
left-to-right; they will be flipped horizontally automatically if the text
direction is right-to-left.

Other properties that influence the behaviour of this function are
`Menu:anchor-hints` and `Menu:menu-type-hint`. Connect to the
`Menu::popped-up` signal to find out how it was actually positioned.
## `widget`
the `Widget` to align `self` with
## `widget_anchor`
the point on `widget` to align with `self`'s anchor point
## `menu_anchor`
the point on `self` to align with `widget`'s anchor point
## `trigger_event`
the `gdk::Event` that initiated this request or
 `None` if it's the current event
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn reorder_child -->
Moves `child` to a new `position` in the list of `self`
children.
## `child`
the `MenuItem` to move
## `position`
the new position to place `child`.
 Positions are numbered from 0 to n - 1
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn reposition -->
Repositions the menu according to its position function.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_accel_group -->
Set the `AccelGroup` which holds global accelerators for the
menu. This accelerator group needs to also be added to all windows
that this menu is being used in with `GtkWindowExt::add_accel_group`,
in order for those windows to support all the accelerators
contained in this group.
## `accel_group`
the `AccelGroup` to be associated
 with the menu.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_accel_path -->
Sets an accelerator path for this menu from which accelerator paths
for its immediate children, its menu items, can be constructed.
The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer the
inconvenience of having to call `GtkMenuItemExt::set_accel_path` on
each menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators.
Instead, by just calling `GtkMenuExt::set_accel_path` on their parent,
each menu item of this menu, that contains a label describing its
purpose, automatically gets an accel path assigned.

For example, a menu containing menu items “New” and “Exit”, will, after
`gtk_menu_set_accel_path (menu, "<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File");` has been
called, assign its items the accel paths: `"<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/New"`
and `"<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/Exit"`.

Assigning accel paths to menu items then enables the user to change
their accelerators at runtime. More details about accelerator paths
and their default setups can be found at `AccelMap::add_entry`.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore,
if you pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning
it first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
a valid accelerator path, or `None` to unset the path
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_active -->
Selects the specified menu item within the menu. This is used by
the `ComboBox` and should not be used by anyone else.
## `index`
the index of the menu item to select. Index values are
 from 0 to n-1
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_monitor -->
Informs GTK+ on which monitor a menu should be popped up.
See `gdk::Monitor::get_geometry`.

This function should be called from a ``GtkMenuPositionFunc``
if the menu should not appear on the same monitor as the pointer.
This information can’t be reliably inferred from the coordinates
returned by a ``GtkMenuPositionFunc``, since, for very long menus,
these coordinates may extend beyond the monitor boundaries or even
the screen boundaries.
## `monitor_num`
the number of the monitor on which the menu should
 be popped up
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_reserve_toggle_size -->
Sets whether the menu should reserve space for drawing toggles
or icons, regardless of their actual presence.
## `reserve_toggle_size`
whether to reserve size for toggles
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn connect_move_scroll -->
## `scroll_type`
a `ScrollType`
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn connect_popped_up -->
Emitted when the position of `menu` is finalized after being popped up
using gtk_menu_popup_at_rect (), gtk_menu_popup_at_widget (), or
gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer ().

`menu` might be flipped over the anchor rectangle in order to keep it
on-screen, in which case `flipped_x` and `flipped_y` will be set to `true`
accordingly.

`flipped_rect` is the ideal position of `menu` after any possible flipping,
but before any possible sliding. `final_rect` is `flipped_rect`, but possibly
translated in the case that flipping is still ineffective in keeping `menu`
on-screen.

![](popup-slide.png)

The blue menu is `menu`'s ideal position, the green menu is `flipped_rect`,
and the red menu is `final_rect`.

See gtk_menu_popup_at_rect (), gtk_menu_popup_at_widget (),
gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer (), `Menu:anchor-hints`,
`Menu:rect-anchor-dx`, `Menu:rect-anchor-dy`, and
`Menu:menu-type-hint`.
## `flipped_rect`
the position of `menu` after any possible
 flipping or `None` if the backend can't obtain it
## `final_rect`
the final position of `menu` or `None` if the
 backend can't obtain it
## `flipped_x`
`true` if the anchors were flipped horizontally
## `flipped_y`
`true` if the anchors were flipped vertically
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_property_accel_group -->
The accel group holding accelerators for the menu.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_property_accel_group -->
The accel group holding accelerators for the menu.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_property_accel_path -->
An accel path used to conveniently construct accel paths of child items.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_property_accel_path -->
An accel path used to conveniently construct accel paths of child items.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_property_active -->
The index of the currently selected menu item, or -1 if no
menu item is selected.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn set_property_active -->
The index of the currently selected menu item, or -1 if no
menu item is selected.
<!-- trait GtkMenuExt::fn get_property_anchor_hints -->
Positioning hints for aligning the menu relative to a rectangle.

These hints determine how the menu should be positioned in the case that
the menu would fall off-screen if placed in its ideal position.

![](popup-flip.png)

For example, `gdk::AnchorHints::FlipY` will replace `gdk::Gravity::NorthWest` with
`gdk::Gravity::SouthWest` and vice versa if the menu extends beyond the
bottom edge of the monitor.

See gtk_menu_popup_at_rect (), gtk_menu_popup_at_widget (),
gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer (), `Menu:rect-anchor-dx`,
`Menu:rect-anchor-dy`, `Menu:menu-type-hint`, and `Menu::popped-up`.

<!-- struct MenuBar -->
The `MenuBar` is a subclass of `MenuShell` which contains one or
more ``GtkMenuItems``. The result is a standard menu bar which can hold
many menu items.

# CSS nodes

`MenuBar` has a single CSS node with name menubar.

# Implements

[`MenuShellExt`](trait.MenuShellExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `MenuBar`

# Returns

the new menu bar, as a `Widget`
<!-- impl MenuBar::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a new `MenuBar` and populates it with menu items
and submenus according to `model`.

The created menu items are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the menu bar belongs - typically
by means of being contained within the ``GtkApplicationWindows``
widget hierarchy.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

a new `MenuBar`
<!-- struct MenuButton -->
The `MenuButton` widget is used to display a popup when clicked on.
This popup can be provided either as a `Menu`, a `Popover` or an
abstract `gio::MenuModel`.

The `MenuButton` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it
can hold almost any other standard `Widget`. The most commonly used
child is `Image`. If no widget is explicitely added to the `MenuButton`,
a `Image` is automatically created, using an arrow image oriented
according to `MenuButton:direction` or the generic “open-menu-symbolic”
icon if the direction is not set.

The positioning of the popup is determined by the `MenuButton:direction`
property of the menu button.

For menus, the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties of the
menu are also taken into account. For example, when the direction is
`ArrowType::Down` and the horizontal alignment is `Align::Start`, the
menu will be positioned below the button, with the starting edge
(depending on the text direction) of the menu aligned with the starting
edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

<!-- trait MenuButtonExt -->
Trait containing all `MenuButton` methods.

# Implementors

[`MenuButton`](struct.MenuButton.html)
<!-- impl MenuButton::fn new -->
Creates a new `MenuButton` widget with downwards-pointing
arrow as the only child. You can replace the child widget
with another `Widget` should you wish to.

# Returns

The newly created `MenuButton` widget
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn get_align_widget -->
Returns the parent `Widget` to use to line up with menu.

<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn get_popup -->
Returns the `Menu` that pops out of the button.
If the button does not use a `Menu`, this function
returns `None`.

# Returns

a `Menu` or `None`
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn get_use_popover -->
Returns whether a `Popover` or a `Menu` will be constructed
from the menu model.

# Returns

`true` if using a `Popover`
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn set_align_widget -->
Sets the `Widget` to use to line the menu with when popped up.
Note that the `align_widget` must contain the `MenuButton` itself.

Setting it to `None` means that the menu will be aligned with the
button itself.

Note that this property is only used with menus currently,
and not for popovers.
## `align_widget`
a `Widget`
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn set_direction -->
Sets the direction in which the popup will be popped up, as
well as changing the arrow’s direction. The child will not
be changed to an arrow if it was customized.

If the does not fit in the available space in the given direction,
GTK+ will its best to keep it inside the screen and fully visible.

If you pass `ArrowType::None` for a `direction`, the popup will behave
as if you passed `ArrowType::Down` (although you won’t see any arrows).
## `direction`
a `ArrowType`
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn set_menu_model -->
Sets the `gio::MenuModel` from which the popup will be constructed,
or `None` to dissociate any existing menu model and disable the button.

Depending on the value of `MenuButton:use-popover`, either a
`Menu` will be created with `Menu::new_from_model`, or a
`Popover` with `Popover::new_from_model`. In either case,
actions will be connected as documented for these functions.

If `MenuButton:popup` or `MenuButton:popover` are already set, those
widgets are dissociated from the `self`, and those properties are set
to `None`.
## `menu_model`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None` to unset and disable the
 button
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn set_popover -->
Sets the `Popover` that will be popped up when the `self` is clicked,
or `None` to dissociate any existing popover and disable the button.

If `MenuButton:menu-model` or `MenuButton:popup` are set, those objects
are dissociated from the `self`, and those properties are set to `None`.
## `popover`
a `Popover`, or `None` to unset and disable the button
<!-- trait MenuButtonExt::fn set_popup -->
Sets the `Menu` that will be popped up when the `self` is clicked, or

To the submenu, if any, associated with the item
<!-- enum MenuDirectionType::variant Next -->
To the next menu item
<!-- enum MenuDirectionType::variant Prev -->
To the previous menu item
<!-- struct MenuItem -->
The `MenuItem` widget and the derived widgets are the only valid
children for menus. Their function is to correctly handle highlighting,
alignment, events and submenus.

As a `MenuItem` derives from `Bin` it can hold any valid child widget,
although only a few are really useful.

By default, a `MenuItem` sets a `AccelLabel` as its child.
`MenuItem` has direct functions to set the label and its mnemonic.
For more advanced label settings, you can fetch the child widget from the `Bin`.

An example for setting markup and accelerator on a MenuItem:

```C
GtkWidget *menu_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Example Menu Item");

GtkWidget *child = gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (menu_item));
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (child), "<i>new label</i> with <b>markup</b>");
gtk_accel_label_set_accel (GTK_ACCEL_LABEL (child), GDK_KEY_1, 0);
```

# `MenuItem` as `Buildable`

The `MenuItem` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding a submenu by specifying “submenu” as the “type” attribute of
a `<child>` element.

An example of UI definition fragment with submenus:

```plain
menuitem
├── <child>
╰── [arrow.right]
```

`MenuItem` has a single CSS node with name menuitem. If the menuitem

<!-- impl MenuItem::fn new -->
Creates a new `MenuItem`.

# Returns

the newly created `MenuItem`
<!-- impl MenuItem::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `MenuItem` whose child is a `Label`.
## `label`
the text for the label

# Returns

the newly created `MenuItem`
<!-- impl MenuItem::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `MenuItem` containing a label.

The label will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`,
so underscores in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the menu item.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `MenuItem`
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn activate -->
Emits the `MenuItem::activate` signal on the given item
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn deselect -->
Emits the `MenuItem::deselect` signal on the given item.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_accel_path -->
Retrieve the accelerator path that was previously set on `self`.

See `GtkMenuItemExt::set_accel_path` for details.

# Returns

the accelerator path corresponding to
 this menu item’s functionality, or `None` if not set
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_label -->
Sets `text` on the `self` label

# Returns

The text in the `self` label. This is the internal
 string used by the label, and must not be modified.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_reserve_indicator -->
Returns whether the `self` reserves space for
the submenu indicator, regardless if it has a submenu
or not.

# Returns

`true` if `self` always reserves space for the
 submenu indicator
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_submenu -->
Gets the submenu underneath this menu item, if any.
See `GtkMenuItemExt::set_submenu`.

# Returns

submenu for this menu item, or `None` if none
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Checks if an underline in the text indicates the next character
should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.

# Returns

`true` if an embedded underline in the label
 indicates the mnemonic accelerator key.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn select -->
Emits the `MenuItem::select` signal on the given item.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_accel_path -->
Set the accelerator path on `self`, through which runtime
changes of the menu item’s accelerator caused by the user can be
identified and saved to persistent storage (see `AccelMap::save`
on this). To set up a default accelerator for this menu item, call
`AccelMap::add_entry` with the same `accel_path`. See also
`AccelMap::add_entry` on the specifics of accelerator paths,
and `GtkMenuExt::set_accel_path` for a more convenient variant of
this function.

This function is basically a convenience wrapper that handles
calling `WidgetExt::set_accel_path` with the appropriate accelerator
group for the menu item.

Note that you do need to set an accelerator on the parent menu with
`GtkMenuExt::set_accel_group` for this to work.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`.
Therefore, if you pass a static string, you can save some memory
by interning it first with `g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
accelerator path, corresponding to this menu
 item’s functionality, or `None` to unset the current path.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_label -->
Sets `text` on the `self` label
## `label`
the text you want to set
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_reserve_indicator -->
Sets whether the `self` should reserve space for
the submenu indicator, regardless if it actually has
a submenu or not.

There should be little need for applications to call
this functions.
## `reserve`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_submenu -->
Sets or replaces the menu item’s submenu, or removes it when a `None`
submenu is passed.
## `submenu`
the submenu, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text indicates the next character
should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `setting`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn toggle_size_allocate -->
Emits the `MenuItem::toggle-size-allocate` signal on the given item.
## `allocation`
the allocation to use as signal data.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn toggle_size_request -->
Emits the `MenuItem::toggle-size-request` signal on the given item.
## `requisition`
the requisition to use as signal data.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn connect_activate -->
Emitted when the item is activated.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn connect_activate_item -->
Emitted when the item is activated, but also if the menu item has a
submenu. For normal applications, the relevant signal is
`MenuItem::activate`.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_property_accel_path -->
Sets the accelerator path of the menu item, through which runtime
changes of the menu item's accelerator caused by the user can be
identified and saved to persistant storage.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_property_accel_path -->
Sets the accelerator path of the menu item, through which runtime
changes of the menu item's accelerator caused by the user can be
identified and saved to persistant storage.

<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_property_submenu -->
The submenu attached to the menu item, or `None` if it has none.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn get_property_use_underline -->
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics.
<!-- trait GtkMenuItemExt::fn set_property_use_underline -->
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics.
<!-- struct MenuShell -->
A `MenuShell` is the abstract base class used to derive the
`Menu` and `MenuBar` subclasses.

A `MenuShell` is a container of `MenuItem` objects arranged
in a list which can be navigated, selected, and activated by the
user to perform application functions. A `MenuItem` can have a
submenu associated with it, allowing for nested hierarchical menus.

# Terminology

A menu item can be “selected”, this means that it is displayed
in the prelight state, and if it has a submenu, that submenu
will be popped up.

A menu is “active” when it is visible onscreen and the user
is selecting from it. A menubar is not active until the user
clicks on one of its menuitems. When a menu is active,
passing the mouse over a submenu will pop it up.

There is also a concept of the current menu and a current
menu item. The current menu item is the selected menu item
that is furthest down in the hierarchy. (Every active menu shell
does not necessarily contain a selected menu item, but if
it does, then the parent menu shell must also contain
a selected menu item.) The current menu is the menu that
contains the current menu item. It will always have a GTK
grab and receive all key presses.

<!-- trait MenuShellExt -->
Trait containing all `MenuShell` methods.

# Implementors

[`MenuBar`](struct.MenuBar.html), [`MenuShell`](struct.MenuShell.html), [`Menu`](struct.Menu.html)
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn activate_item -->
Activates the menu item within the menu shell.
## `menu_item`
the `MenuItem` to activate
## `force_deactivate`
if `true`, force the deactivation of the
 menu shell after the menu item is activated
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn append -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the end of the menu shell's
item list.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn bind_model -->
Establishes a binding between a `MenuShell` and a `gio::MenuModel`.

The contents of `shell` are removed and then refilled with menu items
according to `model`. When `model` changes, `shell` is updated.
Calling this function twice on `shell` with different `model` will
cause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the new
model. If `model` is `None` then any previous binding is undone and
all children are removed.

`with_separators` determines if toplevel items (eg: sections) have
separators inserted between them. This is typically desired for
menus but doesn’t make sense for menubars.

If `action_namespace` is non-`None` then the effect is as if all
actions mentioned in the `model` have their names prefixed with the
namespace, plus a dot. For example, if the action “quit” is
mentioned and `action_namespace` is “app” then the effective action
name is “app.quit”.

This function uses `Actionable` to define the action name and
target values on the created menu items. If you want to use an
action group other than “app” and “win”, or if you want to use a
`MenuShell` outside of a `ApplicationWindow`, then you will need
to attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy using
`WidgetExt::insert_action_group`. As an example, if you created a
group with a “quit” action and inserted it with the name “mygroup”
then you would use the action name “mygroup.quit” in your
`gio::MenuModel`.

For most cases you are probably better off using
`Menu::new_from_model` or `MenuBar::new_from_model` or just
directly passing the `gio::MenuModel` to `GtkApplicationExt::set_app_menu` or
`GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.
## `model`
the `gio::MenuModel` to bind to or `None` to remove
 binding
## `action_namespace`
the namespace for actions in `model`
## `with_separators`
`true` if toplevel items in `shell` should have
 separators between them
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn cancel -->
Cancels the selection within the menu shell.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn deactivate -->
Deactivates the menu shell.

Typically this results in the menu shell being erased
from the screen.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn deselect -->
Deselects the currently selected item from the menu shell,
if any.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_parent_shell -->
Gets the parent menu shell.

The parent menu shell of a submenu is the `Menu` or `MenuBar`
from which it was opened up.

# Returns

the parent `MenuShell`
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_selected_item -->
Gets the currently selected item.

# Returns

the currently selected item
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_take_focus -->
Returns `true` if the menu shell will take the keyboard focus on popup.

# Returns

`true` if the menu shell will take the keyboard focus on popup.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn insert -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the menu shell’s item list
at the position indicated by `position`.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
## `position`
The position in the item list where `child`
 is added. Positions are numbered from 0 to n-1
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn prepend -->
Adds a new `MenuItem` to the beginning of the menu shell's
item list.
## `child`
The `MenuItem` to add
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn select_first -->
Select the first visible or selectable child of the menu shell.
## `search_sensitive`
if `true`, search for the first selectable
 menu item, otherwise select nothing if
 the first item isn’t sensitive. This
 should be `false` if the menu is being
 popped up initially.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn select_item -->
Selects the menu item from the menu shell.
## `menu_item`
The `MenuItem` to select
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn set_take_focus -->
If `take_focus` is `true` (the default) the menu shell will take
the keyboard focus so that it will receive all keyboard events
which is needed to enable keyboard navigation in menus.

Setting `take_focus` to `false` is useful only for special applications
like virtual keyboard implementations which should not take keyboard
focus.

The `take_focus` state of a menu or menu bar is automatically
propagated to submenus whenever a submenu is popped up, so you
don’t have to worry about recursively setting it for your entire
menu hierarchy. Only when programmatically picking a submenu and
popping it up manually, the `take_focus` property of the submenu
needs to be set explicitly.

Note that setting it to `false` has side-effects:

If the focus is in some other app, it keeps the focus and keynav in
the menu doesn’t work. Consequently, keynav on the menu will only
work if the focus is on some toplevel owned by the onscreen keyboard.

To avoid confusing the user, menus with `take_focus` set to `false`
should not display mnemonics or accelerators, since it cannot be
guaranteed that they will work.
## `take_focus`
`true` if the menu shell should take the keyboard
 focus on popup
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_activate_current -->
An action signal that activates the current menu item within
the menu shell.
## `force_hide`
if `true`, hide the menu after activating the menu item
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_cancel -->
An action signal which cancels the selection within the menu shell.
Causes the `MenuShell::selection-done` signal to be emitted.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_cycle_focus -->
A keybinding signal which moves the focus in the
given `direction`.
## `direction`
the direction to cycle in
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_deactivate -->
This signal is emitted when a menu shell is deactivated.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_insert -->
The ::insert signal is emitted when a new `MenuItem` is added to
a `MenuShell`. A separate signal is used instead of
`Container`::add because of the need for an additional position
parameter.

The inverse of this signal is the `Container`::removed signal.
## `child`
the `MenuItem` that is being inserted
## `position`
the position at which the insert occurs
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_move_current -->
A keybinding signal which moves the current menu item
in the direction specified by `direction`.
## `direction`
the direction to move
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_move_selected -->
The ::move-selected signal is emitted to move the selection to
another item.
## `distance`
+1 to move to the next item, -1 to move to the previous

# Returns

`true` to stop the signal emission, `false` to continue
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn connect_selection_done -->
This signal is emitted when a selection has been
completed within a menu shell.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn get_property_take_focus -->
A boolean that determines whether the menu and its submenus grab the
keyboard focus. See `MenuShellExt::set_take_focus` and
`MenuShellExt::get_take_focus`.
<!-- trait MenuShellExt::fn set_property_take_focus -->
A boolean that determines whether the menu and its submenus grab the
keyboard focus. See `MenuShellExt::set_take_focus` and
`MenuShellExt::get_take_focus`.
<!-- struct MenuToolButton -->
A `MenuToolButton` is a `ToolItem` that contains a button and
a small additional button with an arrow. When clicked, the arrow
button pops up a dropdown menu.

Use `MenuToolButton::new` to create a new
`MenuToolButton`.

# `MenuToolButton` as `Buildable`

The `MenuToolButton` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding a menu by specifying “menu” as the “type” attribute
of a `<child>` element.

An example for a UI definition fragment with menus:

```text
<object class="GtkMenuToolButton">
  <child type="menu">
    <object class="GtkMenu"/>
  </child>
</object>
```

# Implementors

[`MenuToolButton`](struct.MenuToolButton.html)
<!-- impl MenuToolButton::fn new -->
Creates a new `MenuToolButton` using `icon_widget` as icon and
`label` as label.
## `icon_widget`
a widget that will be used as icon widget, or `None`
## `label`
a string that will be used as label, or `None`

# Returns

the new `MenuToolButton`
<!-- trait MenuToolButtonExt::fn get_menu -->
Gets the `Menu` associated with `MenuToolButton`.

# Returns

the `Menu` associated
 with `MenuToolButton`
<!-- trait MenuToolButtonExt::fn set_arrow_tooltip_markup -->
Sets the tooltip markup text to be used as tooltip for the arrow button
which pops up the menu. See `ToolItem::set_tooltip_text` for setting
a tooltip on the whole `MenuToolButton`.
## `markup`
markup text to be used as tooltip text for button’s arrow button
<!-- trait MenuToolButtonExt::fn set_arrow_tooltip_text -->
Sets the tooltip text to be used as tooltip for the arrow button which
pops up the menu. See `ToolItem::set_tooltip_text` for setting a tooltip
on the whole `MenuToolButton`.
## `text`
text to be used as tooltip text for button’s arrow button
<!-- trait MenuToolButtonExt::fn set_menu -->
Sets the `Menu` that is popped up when the user clicks on the arrow.
If `menu` is NULL, the arrow button becomes insensitive.
## `menu`
the `Menu` associated with `MenuToolButton`
<!-- trait MenuToolButtonExt::fn connect_show_menu -->
The ::show-menu signal is emitted before the menu is shown.

It can be used to populate the menu on demand, using
`MenuToolButtonExt::set_menu`.

Note that even if you populate the menu dynamically in this way,
you must set an empty menu on the `MenuToolButton` beforehand,
since the arrow is made insensitive if the menu is not set.
<!-- struct MessageDialog -->
`MessageDialog` presents a dialog with some message text. It’s simply a
convenience widget; you could construct the equivalent of `MessageDialog`
from `Dialog` without too much effort, but `MessageDialog` saves typing.

The easiest way to do a modal message dialog is to use `Dialog::run`, though
you can also pass in the `DialogFlags::Modal` flag, `Dialog::run` automatically
makes the dialog modal and waits for the user to respond to it. `Dialog::run`
returns when any dialog button is clicked.

An example for using a modal dialog:

```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                  filename,
                                  g_strerror (errno));
 gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
```

You might do a non-modal `MessageDialog` as follows:

An example for a non-modal dialog:

```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                  filename,
                                  g_strerror (errno));

 // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
 // (e.g. clicks a button)

 g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog, "response",
                           G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy),
                           dialog);
```

<!-- trait MessageDialogExt -->
Trait containing all `MessageDialog` methods.

# Implementors

[`MessageDialog`](struct.MessageDialog.html)
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text
the user may want to see. When the user clicks a button a “response”
signal is emitted with response IDs from `ResponseType`. See
`Dialog` for more details.
## `parent`
transient parent, or `None` for none
## `flags`
flags
## `type_`
type of message
## `buttons`
set of buttons to use
## `message_format`
`printf`-style format string, or `None`

# Returns

a new `MessageDialog`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new_with_markup -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text that
is marked up with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
When the user clicks a button a “response” signal is emitted with
response IDs from `ResponseType`. See `Dialog` for more details.

Special XML characters in the `printf` arguments passed to this
function will automatically be escaped as necessary.
(See `g_markup_printf_escaped` for how this is implemented.)
Usually this is what you want, but if you have an existing
Pango markup string that you want to use literally as the
label, then you need to use `MessageDialogExt::set_markup`
instead, since you can’t pass the markup string either
as the format (it might contain “%” characters) or as a string
argument.

```C
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,

## `flags`
flags
## `type_`
type of message
## `buttons`
set of buttons to use
## `message_format`

# Returns

a new `MessageDialog`
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn format_secondary_markup -->
Sets the secondary text of the message dialog to be `message_format` (with
`printf`-style), which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Due to an oversight, this function does not escape special XML characters
like `MessageDialog::new_with_markup` does. Thus, if the arguments
may contain special XML characters, you should use `g_markup_printf_escaped`
to escape it.


```C
gchar *msg;

msg = g_markup_printf_escaped (message_format, ...);
gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup (message_dialog,
                                            "%s", msg);
g_free (msg);
```
## `message_format`
`printf`-style markup string (see
 [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat]), or `None`
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn format_secondary_text -->
Sets the secondary text of the message dialog to be `message_format`
(with `printf`-style).
## `message_format`
`printf`-style format string, or `None`
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_message_area -->
Returns the message area of the dialog. This is the box where the
dialog’s primary and secondary labels are packed. You can add your
own extra content to that box and it will appear below those labels.
See `DialogExt::get_content_area` for the corresponding
function in the parent `Dialog`.

# Returns

A `Box` corresponding to the
 “message area” in the `self`.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn set_markup -->
Sets the text of the message dialog to be `str`, which is marked
up with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
## `str`
markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_property_message_area -->
The `Box` that corresponds to the message area of this dialog. See

<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_property_secondary_text -->
The secondary text of the message dialog.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn set_property_secondary_text -->
The secondary text of the message dialog.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_property_secondary_use_markup -->
`true` if the secondary text of the dialog includes Pango markup.
See `pango_parse_markup`.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn set_property_secondary_use_markup -->
`true` if the secondary text of the dialog includes Pango markup.
See `pango_parse_markup`.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_property_text -->
The primary text of the message dialog. If the dialog has
a secondary text, this will appear as the title.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn set_property_text -->
The primary text of the message dialog. If the dialog has
a secondary text, this will appear as the title.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn get_property_use_markup -->
`true` if the primary text of the dialog includes Pango markup.
See `pango_parse_markup`.
<!-- trait MessageDialogExt::fn set_property_use_markup -->
`true` if the primary text of the dialog includes Pango markup.
See `pango_parse_markup`.
<!-- enum MessageType -->
The type of message being displayed in the dialog.
<!-- enum MessageType::variant Info -->
Informational message
<!-- enum MessageType::variant Warning -->
Non-fatal warning message
<!-- enum MessageType::variant Question -->
Question requiring a choice
<!-- enum MessageType::variant Error -->
Fatal error message
<!-- enum MessageType::variant Other -->
None of the above
<!-- struct ModelButton -->
`ModelButton` is a button class that can use a `gio::Action` as its model.
In contrast to `ToggleButton` or `RadioButton`, which can also
be backed by a `gio::Action` via the `Actionable:action-name` property,
`ModelButton` will adapt its appearance according to the kind of
action it is backed by, and appear either as a plain, check or
radio button.

Model buttons are used when popovers from a menu model with
`Popover::new_from_model`; they can also be used manually in
a `PopoverMenu`.

When the action is specified via the `Actionable:action-name`
and `Actionable:action-target` properties, the role of the button
(i.e. whether it is a plain, check or radio button) is determined by
the type of the action and doesn't have to be explicitly specified
with the `ModelButton:role` property.

The content of the button is specified by the `ModelButton:text`
and `ModelButton:icon` properties.

The appearance of model buttons can be influenced with the
`ModelButton:centered` and `ModelButton:iconic` properties.

Model buttons have built-in support for submenus in `PopoverMenu`.
To make a `ModelButton` that opens a submenu when activated, set
the `ModelButton:menu-name` property. To make a button that goes
back to the parent menu, you should set the `ModelButton:inverted`
property to place the submenu indicator at the opposite side.

# Example


```plain
modelbutton
├── <child>
╰── check
```


```plain
modelbutton
├── <child>
╰── radio
```


```plain
modelbutton
├── <child>
╰── arrow
```

`ModelButton` has a main CSS node with name modelbutton, and a subnode,
which will have the name check, radio or arrow, depending on the role
of the button and whether it has a menu name set.

The subnode is positioned before or after the content nodes and gets the
.left or .right style class, depending on where it is located.


```plain
button.model
├── <child>
╰── check
```

Iconic model buttons (see `ModelButton:iconic`) change the name of
their main node to button and add a .model style class to it. The indicator
subnode is invisible in this case.

<!-- struct NativeDialog -->
Native dialogs are platform dialogs that don't use `Dialog` or
`Window`. They are used in order to integrate better with a
platform, by looking the same as other native applications and
supporting platform specific features.

The `Dialog` functions cannot be used on such objects, but we
need a similar API in order to drive them. The `NativeDialog`
object is an API that allows you to do this. It allows you to set
various common properties on the dialog, as well as show and hide
it and get a `NativeDialog::response` signal when the user finished
with the dialog.

There is also a `NativeDialogExt::run` helper that makes it easy
to run any native dialog in a modal way with a recursive mainloop,
similar to `Dialog::run`.

# Implements

[`NativeDialogExt`](trait.NativeDialogExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt -->
Trait containing all `NativeDialog` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserNative`](struct.FileChooserNative.html), [`NativeDialog`](struct.NativeDialog.html)
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn destroy -->
Destroys a dialog.

When a dialog is destroyed, it will break any references it holds
to other objects. If it is visible it will be hidden and any underlying
window system resources will be destroyed.

Note that this does not release any reference to the object (as opposed to
destroying a `Window`) because there is no reference from the windowing
system to the `NativeDialog`.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the dialog is modal. See `NativeDialogExt::set_modal`.

# Returns

`true` if the dialog is set to be modal
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_title -->
Gets the title of the `NativeDialog`.

# Returns

the title of the dialog, or `None` if none has
 been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
 and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_transient_for -->
Fetches the transient parent for this window. See
`NativeDialogExt::set_transient_for`.

# Returns

the transient parent for this window,
or `None` if no transient parent has been set.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_visible -->
Determines whether the dialog is visible.

# Returns

`true` if the dialog is visible
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn hide -->
Hides the dialog if it is visilbe, aborting any interaction. Once this
is called the `NativeDialog::response` signal will not be emitted
until after the next call to `NativeDialogExt::show`.

If the dialog is not visible this does nothing.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn run -->
Blocks in a recursive main loop until `self` emits the
`NativeDialog::response` signal. It then returns the response ID
from the ::response signal emission.

Before entering the recursive main loop, `NativeDialogExt::run`
calls `NativeDialogExt::show` on the dialog for you.

After `NativeDialogExt::run` returns, then dialog will be hidden.

Typical usage of this function might be:

```C
  gint result = gtk_native_dialog_run (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (dialog));
  switch (result)
    {
      case GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT:
         do_application_specific_something ();
         break;
      default:
         do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled ();
         break;
    }
  g_object_unref (dialog);
```

Note that even though the recursive main loop gives the effect of a
modal dialog (it prevents the user from interacting with other
windows in the same window group while the dialog is run), callbacks
such as timeouts, IO channel watches, DND drops, etc, will
be triggered during a `NativeDialogExt::run` call.

# Returns

response ID
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets a dialog modal or non-modal. Modal dialogs prevent interaction
with other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogs
on top of main application windows, use
`NativeDialogExt::set_transient_for` to make the dialog transient for the
parent; most [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
will then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
## `modal`
whether the window is modal
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `NativeDialog`.
## `title`
title of the dialog
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_transient_for -->
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window.

Passing `None` for `parent` unsets the current transient window.
## `parent`
parent window, or `None`
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn show -->
Shows the dialog on the display, allowing the user to interact with
it. When the user accepts the state of the dialog the dialog will
be automatically hidden and the `NativeDialog::response` signal
will be emitted.

Multiple calls while the dialog is visible will be ignored.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when the user responds to the dialog.

When this is called the dialog has been hidden.

If you call `NativeDialogExt::hide` before the user responds to
the dialog this signal will not be emitted.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_modal -->
Whether the window should be modal with respect to its transient parent.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_modal -->
Whether the window should be modal with respect to its transient parent.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_title -->
The title of the dialog window
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_title -->
The title of the dialog window
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the dialog, or `None` for none.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the dialog, or `None` for none.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_visible -->
Whether the window is currenlty visible.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_visible -->
Whether the window is currenlty visible.
<!-- struct Notebook -->
The `Notebook` widget is a `Container` whose children are pages that
can be switched between using tab labels along one edge.

There are many configuration options for `Notebook`. Among other
things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear
(see `NotebookExt::set_tab_pos`), whether, if there are too many
tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling
arrows added (see `NotebookExt::set_scrollable`), and whether there
will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages.
(see `NotebookExt::popup_enable`, `NotebookExt::popup_disable`)

# `Notebook` as `Buildable`

The `Notebook` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing children into tabs by specifying “tab” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. Note that the content
of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled.
A tab child can be specified without specifying a `<child>`
type attribute.

To add a child widget in the notebooks action area, specify
"action-start" or “action-end” as the “type” attribute of the
`<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Notebook`:

```plain
notebook
├── header.top
│   ├── [<action widget>]
│   ├── tabs
│   │   ├── [arrow]
│   │   ├── tab
│   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
┊   ┊   ┊
│   │   ├── tab[.reorderable-page]
│   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
│   │   ╰── [arrow]
│   ╰── [<action widget>]
│
╰── stack
    ├── <child>
    ┊
    ╰── <child>
```

`Notebook` has a main CSS node with name notebook, a subnode
with name header and below that a subnode with name tabs which
contains one subnode per tab with name tab.

If action widgets are present, their CSS nodes are placed next
to the tabs node. If the notebook is scrollable, CSS nodes with
name arrow are placed as first and last child of the tabs node.

The main node gets the .frame style class when the notebook
has a border (see `NotebookExt::set_show_border`).

The header node gets one of the style class .top, .bottom,
.left or .right, depending on where the tabs are placed. For
reorderable pages, the tab node gets the .reorderable-page class.

A tab node gets the .dnd style class while it is moved with drag-and-drop.

The nodes are always arranged from left-to-right, regarldess of text direction.

a `Box` if you need to pack more than one widget on the same side.

Note that action widgets are “internal” children of the notebook and thus
not included in the list returned from `ContainerExt::foreach`.
## `widget`
a `Widget`
## `pack_type`
pack type of the action widget
<!-- trait NotebookExtManual::fn set_current_page -->
Switches to the page number `page_num`.

Note that due to historical reasons, `Notebook` refuses
to switch to a page unless the child widget is visible.
Therefore, it is recommended to show child widgets before
adding them to a notebook.
## `page_num`

 If negative, the last page will be used. If greater
 than the number of pages in the notebook, nothing
 will be done.
<!-- trait NotebookExt::fn set_group_name -->

## `child`
the child widget
## `menu_text`

<!-- trait NotebookExt::fn set_scrollable -->
Sets whether the tab label area will have arrows for
scrolling if there are too many tabs to fit in the area.
## `scrollable`
`true` if scroll arrows should be added
<!-- trait NotebookExt::fn set_show_border -->
Sets whether a bevel will be drawn around the notebook pages.
This only has a visual effect when the tabs are not shown.
See `NotebookExt::set_show_tabs`.
## `show_border`
`true` if a bevel should be drawn around the notebook
<!-- trait NotebookExt::fn set_show_tabs -->
Sets whether to show the tabs for the notebook or not.
## `show_tabs`
`true` if the tabs should be shown
<!-- trait NotebookExt::fn set_tab_detachable -->
Sets whether the tab can be detached from `self` to another
notebook or widget.

Note that 2 notebooks must share a common group identificator
(see `NotebookExt::set_group_name`) to allow automatic tabs
interchange between them.

If you want a widget to interact with a notebook through DnD
(i.e.: accept dragged tabs from it) it must be set as a drop
destination and accept the target “GTK_NOTEBOOK_TAB”. The notebook
will fill the selection with a `Widget`** pointing to the child
widget that corresponds to the dropped tab.

Note that you should use `NotebookExt::detach_tab` instead
of `ContainerExt::remove` if you want to remove the tab from
the source notebook as part of accepting a drop. Otherwise,
the source notebook will think that the dragged tab was
removed from underneath the ongoing drag operation, and
will initiate a drag cancel animation.


```C
 static void
 on_drag_data_received (GtkWidget        *widget,
                        GdkDrag          *drag,
                        GtkSelectionData *data,
                        guint             time,
                        gpointer          user_data)
 {
   GtkWidget *notebook;
   GtkWidget **child;

   notebook = gtk_drag_get_source_widget (drag);
   child = (void*) gtk_selection_data_get_data (data);

   // process_widget (*child);

   gtk_notebook_detach_tab (GTK_NOTEBOOK (notebook), *child);
 }
```

If you want a notebook to accept drags from other widgets,
you will have to set your own DnD code to do it.

<!-- struct Orientable -->
The `Orientable` interface is implemented by all widgets that can be
oriented horizontally or vertically. `Orientable` is more flexible in that
it allows the orientation to be changed at runtime, allowing the widgets
to “flip”.

`Orientable` was introduced in GTK+ 2.16.

<!-- enum Orientation -->
Represents the orientation of widgets and other objects which can be switched
between horizontal and vertical orientation on the fly, like `Toolbar` or
`GesturePan`.
<!-- enum Orientation::variant Horizontal -->
The element is in horizontal orientation.
<!-- enum Orientation::variant Vertical -->
The element is in vertical orientation.
<!-- enum Overflow -->
Defines how content overflowing a given area should be handled, such as
with `WidgetExt::set_overflow`. This property is modeled after the CSS overflow
property, but implements it only partially.
<!-- enum Overflow::variant Visible -->
No change is applied. Content is drawn at the specified
 position.
<!-- enum Overflow::variant Hidden -->
Content is clipped to the bounds of the area. Content
 outside the area is not drawn and cannot be interacted with.
<!-- struct Overlay -->
`Overlay` is a container which contains a single main child, on top
of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The position of each overlay
widget is determined by its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign`
properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to `Align::Start`
will be placed at the top left corner of the `Overlay` container,
whereas an overlay with halign set to `Align::Center` and valign set
to `Align::End` will be placed a the bottom edge of the `Overlay`,
horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin
properties of the child to non-zero values.

More complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting
to the `Overlay::get-child-position` signal.

# `Overlay` as `Buildable`

The `Overlay` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing a child as an overlay by specifying “overlay” as
the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

# CSS nodes

`Overlay` has a single CSS node with the name “overlay”. Overlay children
whose alignments cause them to be positioned at an edge get the style classes
“.left”, “.right”, “.top”, and/or “.bottom” according to their position.

# Implements

<!-- trait OverlayExt -->
Trait containing all `Overlay` methods.

# Implementors

[`Overlay`](struct.Overlay.html)
<!-- impl Overlay::fn new -->
Creates a new `Overlay`.

# Returns

a new `Overlay` object.
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn add_overlay -->
Adds `widget` to `self`.

The widget will be stacked on top of the main widget
added with `ContainerExt::add`.

The position at which `widget` is placed is determined
from its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties.
## `widget`
a `Widget` to be added to the container
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn get_clip_overlay -->
Convenience function to get the value of the `Overlay:clip-overlay`
child property for `widget`.
## `widget`
an overlay child of `Overlay`

# Returns

whether the widget is clipped within the parent.
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn get_measure_overlay -->
Gets whether `widget`'s size is included in the measurement of
`self`.
## `widget`

# Returns

whether the widget is measured
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn set_clip_overlay -->
Convenience function to set the value of the `Overlay:clip-overlay`
child property for `widget`.
## `widget`
an overlay child of `Overlay`
## `clip_overlay`
whether the child should be clipped
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn set_measure_overlay -->
Sets whether `widget` is included in the measured size of `self`.

The overlay will request the size of the largest child that has
this property set to `true`. Children who are not included may
be drawn outside of `self`'s allocation if they are too large.
## `widget`
an overlay child of `Overlay`
## `measure`
whether the child should be measured
<!-- trait OverlayExt::fn connect_get_child_position -->
The ::get-child-position signal is emitted to determine
the position and size of any overlay child widgets. A
handler for this signal should fill `allocation` with
the desired position and size for `widget`, relative to
the 'main' child of `overlay`.

The default handler for this signal uses the `widget`'s
halign and valign properties to determine the position
and gives the widget its natural size (except that an
alignment of `Align::Fill` will cause the overlay to
be full-width/height). If the main child is a
`ScrolledWindow`, the overlays are placed relative
to its contents.
## `widget`
the child widget to position
## `allocation`
return
 location for the allocation

# Returns

`true` if the `allocation` has been filled
<!-- enum PackType -->
Represents the packing location `Box` children
<!-- enum PackType::variant Start -->

<!-- struct PadActionEntry -->
Struct defining a pad action entry.
<!-- enum PadActionType -->
The type of a pad action.
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Button -->
Action is triggered by a pad button
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Ring -->
Action is triggered by a pad ring
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Strip -->
Action is triggered by a pad strip
<!-- struct PadController -->
`PadController` is an event controller for the pads found in drawing
tablets (The collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
the stylus-sensitive area).

These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
perform no action, this event controller is provided to map those to
`gio::Action` objects, thus letting the application give those a more semantic
meaning.

Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action, some
`gdk::InputSource::TabletPad` devices feature multiple "modes", all these input
elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
being triggered. Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups,
all elements in a group share the same current mode, but different groups
may have different modes. See `gdk::DevicePad::get_n_groups` and
`gdk::DevicePad::get_group_n_modes`.

Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given
mode is defined by `PadActionEntry`, it contains an action name that
will be looked up in the given `gio::ActionGroup` and activated whenever the
specified input element and mode are triggered.

A simple example of `PadController` usage, assigning button 1 in all
modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:

```text
  GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
    { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
    …
  };

  …
  action_group = g_simple_action_group_new ();
  action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
  g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
  g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
  …
  pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (action_group, NULL);
```

The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE` bearing the value of the given axis, it
is required that those are made stateful and accepting this `glib::VariantType`.

# Implements

[`EventControllerExt`](trait.EventControllerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl PadController::fn new -->
Creates a new `PadController` that will associate events from `pad` to
actions. A `None` pad may be provided so the controller manages all pad devices
generically, it is discouraged to mix `PadController` objects with `None`
and non-`None` `pad` argument on the same toplevel window, as execution order
is not guaranteed.

The `PadController` is created with no mapped actions. In order to map pad
events to actions, use `PadController::set_action_entries` or
`PadController::set_action`.

Be aware that pad events will only be delivered to ``GtkWindows``, so adding a pad
controller to any other type of widget will not have an effect.
## `group`
`gio::ActionGroup` to trigger actions from
## `pad`
A `gdk::InputSource::TabletPad` device, or `None` to handle all pads

# Returns

A newly created `PadController`
<!-- impl PadController::fn set_action -->
Adds an individual action to `self`. This action will only be activated
if the given button/ring/strip number in `index` is interacted while
the current mode is `mode`. -1 may be used for simple cases, so the action
is triggered on all modes.

The given `label` should be considered user-visible, so internationalization
rules apply. Some windowing systems may be able to use those for user
feedback.
## `type_`
the type of pad feature that will trigger this action
## `index`
the 0-indexed button/ring/strip number that will trigger this action
## `mode`
the mode that will trigger this action, or -1 for all modes.
## `label`
Human readable description of this action, this string should
 be deemed user-visible.
## `action_name`
action name that will be activated in the `gio::ActionGroup`
<!-- impl PadController::fn set_action_entries -->
This is a convenience function to add a group of action entries on
`self`. See `PadActionEntry` and `PadController::set_action`.
## `entries`
the action entries to set on `self`
## `n_entries`
the number of elements in `entries`
<!-- enum PageOrientation -->
See also `PrintSettings::set_orientation`.
<!-- enum PageOrientation::variant Portrait -->

Reverse portrait mode.
<!-- enum PageOrientation::variant ReverseLandscape -->
Reverse landscape mode.
<!-- struct PageRange -->
See also `PrintSettings::set_page_ranges`.
<!-- enum PageSet -->
See also `gtk_print_job_set_page_set`.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant All -->
All pages.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant Even -->
Even pages.
<!-- enum PageSet::variant Odd -->
Odd pages.
<!-- struct PageSetup -->
A `PageSetup` object stores the page size, orientation and margins.
The idea is that you can get one of these from the page setup dialog
and then pass it to the `PrintOperation` when printing.
The benefit of splitting this out of the `PrintSettings` is that
these affect the actual layout of the page, and thus need to be set
long before user prints.

## Margins ## {`print`-margins}
The margins specified in this object are the “print margins”, i.e. the
parts of the page that the printer cannot print on. These are different
from the layout margins that a word processor uses; they are typically
used to determine the minimal size for the layout
margins.

To obtain a `PageSetup` use `PageSetup::new` to get the defaults,
or use `gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog` to show the page setup dialog
and receive the resulting page setup.

## A page setup dialog


```C
static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;
static GtkPageSetup *page_setup = NULL;

static void
do_page_setup (void)
{
  GtkPageSetup *new_page_setup;

  if (settings == NULL)
    settings = gtk_print_settings_new ();

  new_page_setup = gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog (GTK_WINDOW (main_window),
                                                    page_setup, settings);

  if (page_setup)
    g_object_unref (page_setup);

  page_setup = new_page_setup;
}
```

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- struct Paned -->
`Paned` has two panes, arranged either
horizontally or vertically. The division between
the two panes is adjustable by the user by dragging
a handle.

Child widgets are
added to the panes of the widget with `PanedExt::pack1` and
`PanedExt::pack2`. The division between the two children is set by default
from the size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the
user.

A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a
small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not
draw any relief around the children or around the separator. (The space
in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to put
each child inside a `Frame` with the shadow type set to `ShadowType::In`
so that the gutter appears as a ridge. No separator is drawn if one of
the children is missing.

Each child has two options that can be set, `resize` and `shrink`. If
`resize` is true, then when the `Paned` is resized, that child will
expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If `shrink` is true, then
that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user.
Setting `shrink` to `false` allows the application to set a minimum size.
If `resize` is false for both children, then this is treated as if
`resize` is true for both children.

The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set
by the user, by calling `PanedExt::set_position`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
paned
├── <child>
├── separator[.wide]
╰── <child>
```

`Paned` has a main CSS node with name paned, and a subnode for
the separator with name separator. The subnode gets a .wide style
class when the paned is supposed to be wide.

In horizontal orientation, the nodes are arranged based on the text
direction, so in left-to-right mode, :first-child will select the
leftmost child, while it will select the rightmost child in
RTL layouts.

## Creating a paned widget with minimum sizes.

<!-- struct PaperSize -->
`PaperSize` handles paper sizes. It uses the standard called
[PWG 5101.1-2002 PWG: Standard for Media Standardized Names](http://www.pwg.org/standards.html)
to name the paper sizes (and to get the data for the page sizes).
In addition to standard paper sizes, `PaperSize` allows to
construct custom paper sizes with arbitrary dimensions.

and height) of a paper size and its name, it also provides
default [print margins][print-margins].

<!-- struct Picture -->
The `Picture` widget displays a `gdk::Paintable`. Many convenience functions
are provided to make pictures simple to use. For example, if you want to load
an image from a file, and then display that, there’s a convenience function
to do this:

```C
  GtkWidget *widget;
  widget = gtk_picture_new_for_filename ("myfile.png");
```
If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the picture will contain a
“broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file`, then create the `Picture` with
`Picture::new_for_paintable`.

Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
files, such as image files. See the documentation of `gio::Resource` for details.
In this case, `Picture::new_for_resource` and `PictureExt::set_resource`
should be used.

# CSS nodes

`Picture` has a single CSS node with the name picture.

 independent of the content.
<!-- enum PolicyType::variant Automatic -->
The scrollbar will appear and disappear as necessary.

<!-- enum PolicyType::variant External -->
Don't show a scrollbar, but don't force the
 size to follow the content. This can be used e.g. to make multiple
 scrolled windows share a scrollbar.
<!-- struct Popover -->
`Popover` is a bubble-like context window, primarily meant to
provide context-dependent information or options. Popovers are
attached to a widget, passed at construction time on `Popover::new`,
or updated afterwards through `PopoverExt::set_relative_to`, by
default they will point to the whole widget area, although this
behavior can be changed through `PopoverExt::set_pointing_to`.

The position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to
can also be changed through `PopoverExt::set_position`.

By default, `Popover` performs a GTK+ grab, in order to ensure
input events get redirected to it while it is shown, and also so
the popover is dismissed in the expected situations (clicks outside
the popover, or the Esc key being pressed). If no such modal behavior
is desired on a popover, `PopoverExt::set_modal` may be called on it
to tweak its behavior.

## `Popover` as menu replacement

`Popover` is often used to replace menus. To facilitate this, it
supports being populated from a `gio::MenuModel`, using
`Popover::new_from_model`. In addition to all the regular menu
model features, this function supports rendering sections in the
model in a more compact form, as a row of icon buttons instead of
menu items.

To use this rendering, set the ”display-hint” attribute of the
section to ”horizontal-buttons” and set the icons of your items
with the ”verb-icon” attribute.


```plain
popover
├── arrow
╰── contents.background[.menu]
    ╰── <child>
```

The contents child node always gets the .background style class and it
gets the .menu style class if the popover is menu-like (e.g. `PopoverMenu`
or created using `Popover::new_from_model`).

Particular uses of `Popover`, such as touch selection popups
or magnifiers in `Entry` or `TextView` get style classes
like .touch-selection or .magnifier to differentiate from
plain popovers.

When styling a popover directly, the popover node should usually not have any
background.

Note that, in order to accomplish appropriate arrow visuals, `Popover` uses
custom drawing for the arrow node. This makes it possible for the arrow to change
its shape dynamically, but it also limits the possibilities of styling it using CSS.
In particular, the arrow gets drawn over the content node's border so they look
like one shape, which means that the border-width of the content node and the arrow
node should be the same. The arrow also does not support any border shape other than
solid, no border-radius, only one border width (border-bottom-width is used) and no box-shadow.

<!-- impl Popover::fn new -->
Creates a new popover to point to `relative_to`
## `relative_to`
`Widget` the popover is related to

# Returns

a new `Popover`
<!-- impl Popover::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a `Popover` and populates it according to
`model`. The popover is pointed to the `relative_to` widget.

The created buttons are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the popover belongs - typically
by means of being attached to a widget that is contained within
the ``GtkApplicationWindows`` widget hierarchy.

Actions can also be added using `WidgetExt::insert_action_group`
on the menus attach widget or on any of its parent widgets.
## `relative_to`
`Widget` the popover is related to
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`

# Returns

the new `Popover`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn bind_model -->
Establishes a binding between a `Popover` and a `gio::MenuModel`.

The contents of `self` are removed and then refilled with menu items
according to `model`. When `model` changes, `self` is updated.
Calling this function twice on `self` with different `model` will
cause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the new
model. If `model` is `None` then any previous binding is undone and
all children are removed.

If `action_namespace` is non-`None` then the effect is as if all
actions mentioned in the `model` have their names prefixed with the
namespace, plus a dot. For example, if the action “quit” is
mentioned and `action_namespace` is “app” then the effective action
name is “app.quit”.

This function uses `Actionable` to define the action name and
target values on the created menu items. If you want to use an
action group other than “app” and “win”, or if you want to use a
`MenuShell` outside of a `ApplicationWindow`, then you will need
to attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy using
`WidgetExt::insert_action_group`. As an example, if you created a
group with a “quit” action and inserted it with the name “mygroup”
then you would use the action name “mygroup.quit” in your
`gio::MenuModel`.
## `model`
the `gio::MenuModel` to bind to or `None` to remove
 binding
## `action_namespace`
the namespace for actions in `model`

the popover without a transition, use `WidgetExt::hide`.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn popup -->
Pops `self` up. This is different than a `WidgetExt::show` call
in that it shows the popover with a transition. If you want to show
the popover without a transition, use `WidgetExt::show`.

Sets the widget that should be set as default widget while
the popover is shown (see `gtk_window_set_default`). `Popover`
remembers the previous default widget and reestablishes it
when the popover is dismissed.
## `widget`
the new default widget, or `None`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets whether `self` is modal, a modal popover will grab all input
within the toplevel and grab the keyboard focus on it when being
displayed. Clicking outside the popover area or pressing Esc will
dismiss the popover and ungrab input.
## `modal`
`true` to make popover claim all input within the toplevel
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_pointing_to -->
Sets the rectangle that `self` will point to, in the
coordinate space of the widget `self` is attached to,
see `PopoverExt::set_relative_to`.
## `rect`
rectangle to point to
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_position -->
Sets the preferred position for `self` to appear. If the `self`
is currently visible, it will be immediately updated.

This preference will be respected where possible, although
on lack of space (eg. if close to the window edges), the
`Popover` may choose to appear on the opposite side
## `position`
preferred popover position
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_relative_to -->
Sets a new widget to be attached to `self`. If `self` is
visible, the position will be updated.

Note: the ownership of popovers is always given to their `relative_to`
widget, so if `relative_to` is set to `None` on an attached `self`, it
will be detached from its previous widget, and consequently destroyed
unless extra references are kept.
## `relative_to`
a `Widget`
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn connect_closed -->
This signal is emitted when the popover is dismissed either through
API or user interaction.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_property_constrain_to -->
Sets a constraint for the popover position.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_property_constrain_to -->
Sets a constraint for the popover position.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_property_modal -->
Sets whether the popover is modal (so other elements in the window do not
receive input while the popover is visible).
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_property_modal -->
Sets whether the popover is modal (so other elements in the window do not
receive input while the popover is visible).
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_property_pointing_to -->
Marks a specific rectangle to be pointed.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_property_pointing_to -->
Marks a specific rectangle to be pointed.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_property_position -->
Sets the preferred position of the popover.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_property_position -->
Sets the preferred position of the popover.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn get_property_relative_to -->
Sets the attached widget.
<!-- trait PopoverExt::fn set_property_relative_to -->
Sets the attached widget.
<!-- enum PopoverConstraint -->
Describes constraints to positioning of popovers. More values
may be added to this enumeration in the future.
<!-- enum PopoverConstraint::variant None -->
Don't constrain the popover position
 beyond what is imposed by the implementation
<!-- enum PopoverConstraint::variant Window -->
Constrain the popover to the boundaries
 of the window that it is attached to
<!-- struct PopoverMenu -->
`PopoverMenu` is a subclass of `Popover` that treats its
children like menus and allows switching between them. It is
meant to be used primarily together with `ModelButton`, but
any widget can be used, such as `SpinButton` or `Scale`.
In this respect, `PopoverMenu` is more flexible than popovers
that are created from a `gio::MenuModel` with `Popover::new_from_model`.

To add a child as a submenu, use `PopoverMenuExt::add_submenu`.
To let the user open this submenu, add a `ModelButton` whose
`ModelButton:menu-name` property is set to the name you've given
to the submenu.

To add a named submenu in a ui file, set the `Widget:name` property
of the widget that you are adding as a child of the popover menu.

By convention, the first child of a submenu should be a `ModelButton`
to switch back to the parent menu. Such a button should use the
`ModelButton:inverted` and `ModelButton:centered` properties
to achieve a title-like appearance and place the submenu indicator
at the opposite side. To switch back to the main menu, use "main"
as the menu name.

# Example


```text
<object class="GtkPopoverMenu">

    <object class="GtkBox">
      <property name="visible">True</property>
      <property name="margin">10</property>

# CSS Nodes

`PopoverMenu` is just a subclass of `Popover` that adds
custom content to it, therefore it has the same CSS nodes.
It is one of the cases that add a .menu style class to the
popover's contents node.

# Implements

[`PopoverMenuExt`](trait.PopoverMenuExt.html), [`PopoverExt`](trait.PopoverExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait PopoverMenuExt -->
Trait containing all `PopoverMenu` methods.

# Implementors

[`PopoverMenu`](struct.PopoverMenu.html)
<!-- impl PopoverMenu::fn new -->
Creates a new popover menu.

# Returns

a new `PopoverMenu`
<!-- trait PopoverMenuExt::fn add_submenu -->
Adds a submenu to the popover menu.
## `submenu`
a widget to add as submenu
## `name`
the name for the submenu
<!-- trait PopoverMenuExt::fn open_submenu -->
Opens a submenu of the `self`. The `name`
must be one of the names given to the submenus
of `self` with `PopoverMenu:submenu`, or
"main" to switch back to the main menu.

`ModelButton` will open submenus automatically
when the `ModelButton:menu-name` property is set,
so this function is only needed when you are using
other kinds of widgets to initiate menu changes.
## `name`
the name of the menu to switch to
<!-- enum PositionType -->
Describes which edge of a widget a certain feature is positioned at, e.g. the
tabs of a `Notebook`, the handle of a ``GtkHandleBox`` or the label of a
`Scale`.
<!-- enum PositionType::variant Left -->
The feature is at the left edge.
<!-- enum PositionType::variant Right -->
The feature is at the right edge.
<!-- enum PositionType::variant Top -->
The feature is at the top edge.
<!-- enum PositionType::variant Bottom -->
The feature is at the bottom edge.
<!-- struct PrintContext -->
A `PrintContext` encapsulates context information that is required when
drawing pages for printing, such as the cairo context and important
parameters like page size and resolution. It also lets you easily
create `pango::Layout` and `pango::Context` objects that match the font metrics
of the cairo surface.

`PrintContext` objects gets passed to the `PrintOperation::begin-print`,
`PrintOperation::end-print`, `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals on the `PrintOperation`.

## Using `PrintContext` in a `PrintOperation::draw-page` callback


```C
static void
draw_page (GtkPrintOperation *operation,
       GtkPrintContext   *context,
       int                page_nr)
{
  cairo_t *cr;
  PangoLayout *layout;
  PangoFontDescription *desc;

  cr = gtk_print_context_get_cairo_context (context);

  // Draw a red rectangle, as wide as the paper (inside the margins)
  cairo_set_source_rgb (cr, 1.0, 0, 0);
  cairo_rectangle (cr, 0, 0, gtk_print_context_get_width (context), 50);

  pango_layout_set_text (layout, "Hello World! Printing is easy", -1);
  desc = pango_font_description_from_string ("sans 28");
  pango_layout_set_font_description (layout, desc);
  pango_font_description_free (desc);

  cairo_move_to (cr, 30, 20);

  // Font Fill
  cairo_set_source_rgb (cr, 0, 0.0, 1.0);
  cairo_fill (cr);

  g_object_unref (layout);
}
```

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

an internal print preview, it is not needed for printing,
since GTK+ itself creates a suitable cairo context in that
case.
## `cr`

An error occurred while loading a page setup
 or paper size from a key file.
<!-- struct PrintOperation -->
`PrintOperation` is the high-level, portable printing API.
It looks a bit different than other GTK+ dialogs such as the
`FileChooser`, since some platforms don’t expose enough
infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such
platforms, `PrintOperation` uses the native print dialog.
On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK+
uses its own, see ``GtkPrintUnixDialog``.

The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create
a `PrintOperation` object with `PrintOperation::new` when
the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it,
e.g. the page size, any `PrintSettings` from previous print
operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.

Then you start the print operation by calling `PrintOperationExt::run`.
It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and
options. When the user finished the dialog various signals will
be emitted on the `PrintOperation`, the main one being
`PrintOperation::draw-page`, which you are supposed to catch
and render the page on the provided `PrintContext` using Cairo.

# The high-level printing API


```C
static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;

static void
do_print (void)
{
  GtkPrintOperation *print;
  GtkPrintOperationResult res;

  print = gtk_print_operation_new ();

  if (settings != NULL)
    gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);

  g_signal_connect (print, "begin_print", G_CALLBACK (begin_print), NULL);
  g_signal_connect (print, "draw_page", G_CALLBACK (draw_page), NULL);

  res = gtk_print_operation_run (print, GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                                 GTK_WINDOW (main_window), NULL);

  if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY)
    {
      if (settings != NULL)
        g_object_unref (settings);
      settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
    }

  g_object_unref (print);
}
```

By default `PrintOperation` uses an external application to do
print preview. To implement a custom print preview, an application
must connect to the preview signal. The functions
`PrintOperationPreview::render_page`,
`PrintOperationPreview::end_preview` and
`PrintOperationPreview::is_selected`
are useful when implementing a print preview.

# Implements

[`PrintOperationExt`](trait.PrintOperationExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`PrintOperationPreviewExt`](trait.PrintOperationPreviewExt.html)
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt -->
Trait containing all `PrintOperation` methods.

# Implementors

[`PrintOperation`](struct.PrintOperation.html)
<!-- impl PrintOperation::fn new -->
Creates a new `PrintOperation`.

# Returns

a new `PrintOperation`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn cancel -->
Cancels a running print operation. This function may
be called from a `PrintOperation::begin-print`,
`PrintOperation::paginate` or `PrintOperation::draw-page`
signal handler to stop the currently running print
operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn draw_page_finish -->
Signalize that drawing of particular page is complete.

It is called after completion of page drawing (e.g. drawing in another
thread).
If `PrintOperationExt::set_defer_drawing` was called before, then this function
has to be called by application. In another case it is called by the library
itself.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_default_page_setup -->
Returns the default page setup, see
`PrintOperationExt::set_default_page_setup`.

# Returns

the default page setup
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_embed_page_setup -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:embed-page-setup` property.

# Returns

whether page setup selection combos are embedded
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_error -->
Call this when the result of a print operation is
`PrintOperationResult::Error`, either as returned by
`PrintOperationExt::run`, or in the `PrintOperation::done` signal
handler. The returned `glib::Error` will contain more details on what went wrong.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_has_selection -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:has-selection` property.

# Returns

whether there is a selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_n_pages_to_print -->
Returns the number of pages that will be printed.

Note that this value is set during print preparation phase
(`PrintStatus::Preparing`), so this function should never be
called before the data generation phase (`PrintStatus::GeneratingData`).
You can connect to the `PrintOperation::status-changed` signal
and call `PrintOperationExt::get_n_pages_to_print` when
print status is `PrintStatus::GeneratingData`.
This is typically used to track the progress of print operation.

# Returns

the number of pages that will be printed
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_print_settings -->
Returns the current print settings.

Note that the return value is `None` until either
`PrintOperationExt::set_print_settings` or
`PrintOperationExt::run` have been called.

# Returns

the current print settings of `self`.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_status -->
Returns the status of the print operation.
Also see `PrintOperationExt::get_status_string`.

# Returns

the status of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_status_string -->
Returns a string representation of the status of the
print operation. The string is translated and suitable
for displaying the print status e.g. in a `Statusbar`.

Use `PrintOperationExt::get_status` to obtain a status
value that is suitable for programmatic use.

# Returns

a string representation of the status
 of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_support_selection -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:support-selection` property.

# Returns

whether the application supports print of selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn is_finished -->
A convenience function to find out if the print operation
is finished, either successfully (`PrintStatus::Finished`)
or unsuccessfully (`PrintStatus::FinishedAborted`).

Note: when you enable print status tracking the print operation
can be in a non-finished state even after done has been called, as
the operation status then tracks the print job status on the printer.

# Returns

`true`, if the print operation is finished.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn run -->
Runs the print operation, by first letting the user modify
print settings in the print dialog, and then print the document.

Normally that this function does not return until the rendering of all
pages is complete. You can connect to the
`PrintOperation::status-changed` signal on `self` to obtain some
information about the progress of the print operation.
Furthermore, it may use a recursive mainloop to show the print dialog.

If you call `PrintOperationExt::set_allow_async` or set the
`PrintOperation:allow-async` property the operation will run
asynchronously if this is supported on the platform. The
`PrintOperation::done` signal will be emitted with the result of the
operation when the it is done (i.e. when the dialog is canceled, or when
the print succeeds or fails).

```C
if (settings != NULL)
  gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);
  
if (page_setup != NULL)
  gtk_print_operation_set_default_page_setup (print, page_setup);
  
g_signal_connect (print, "begin-print",
                  G_CALLBACK (begin_print), &data);
g_signal_connect (print, "draw-page",
                  G_CALLBACK (draw_page), &data);
 
res = gtk_print_operation_run (print,
                               GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                               parent,
                               &error);
 
if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_ERROR)
 {
   error_dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (GTK_WINDOW (parent),
                                   GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
                         GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                         GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                         "Error printing file:\n%s",
                         error->message);
   g_signal_connect (error_dialog, "response",
                     G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), NULL);
   gtk_widget_show (error_dialog);
   g_error_free (error);
 }
else if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY)
 {
   if (settings != NULL)
g_object_unref (settings);
   settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
 }
```

Note that `PrintOperationExt::run` can only be called once on a
given `PrintOperation`.
## `action`
the action to start
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog

# Returns

the result of the print operation. A return value of
 `PrintOperationResult::Apply` indicates that the printing was
 completed successfully. In this case, it is a good idea to obtain
 the used print settings with `PrintOperationExt::get_print_settings`
 and store them for reuse with the next print operation. A value of
 `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` means the operation is running
 asynchronously, and will emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when
 done.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_allow_async -->
Sets whether the `PrintOperationExt::run` may return
before the print operation is completed. Note that
some platforms may not allow asynchronous operation.
## `allow_async`
`true` to allow asynchronous operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_current_page -->
Sets the current page.

If this is called before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
## `current_page`
the current page, 0-based
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_custom_tab_label -->
Sets the label for the tab holding custom widgets.
## `label`
the label to use, or `None` to use the default label
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_default_page_setup -->
Makes `default_page_setup` the default page setup for `self`.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,
but it can be overridden on a per-page basis by connecting
to the `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` signal.
## `default_page_setup`
a `PageSetup`, or `None`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_defer_drawing -->
Sets up the `PrintOperation` to wait for calling of
`PrintOperationExt::draw_page_finish` from application. It can
be used for drawing page in another thread.

This function must be called in the callback of “draw-page” signal.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_embed_page_setup -->
Embed page size combo box and orientation combo box into page setup page.
Selected page setup is stored as default page setup in `PrintOperation`.
## `embed`
`true` to embed page setup selection in the ``GtkPrintUnixDialog``
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_export_filename -->
Sets up the `PrintOperation` to generate a file instead
of showing the print dialog. The indended use of this function
is for implementing “Export to PDF” actions. Currently, PDF
is the only supported format.

“Print to PDF” support is independent of this and is done
by letting the user pick the “Print to PDF” item from the list
of printers in the print dialog.
## `filename`
the filename for the exported file
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_has_selection -->
Sets whether there is a selection to print.

Application has to set number of pages to which the selection
will draw by `PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages` in a callback of
`PrintOperation::begin-print`.
## `has_selection`
`true` indicates that a selection exists
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_job_name -->
Sets the name of the print job. The name is used to identify
the job (e.g. in monitoring applications like eggcups).

If you don’t set a job name, GTK+ picks a default one by
numbering successive print jobs.
## `job_name`
a string that identifies the print job
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_n_pages -->
Sets the number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal hander.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup`
and `PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
## `n_pages`
the number of pages
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_print_settings -->
Sets the print settings for `self`. This is typically used to
re-establish print settings from a previous print operation,
see `PrintOperationExt::run`.
## `print_settings`
`PrintSettings`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_show_progress -->
If `show_progress` is `true`, the print operation will show a
progress dialog during the print operation.
## `show_progress`
`true` to show a progress dialog
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_support_selection -->
Sets whether selection is supported by `PrintOperation`.
## `support_selection`
`true` to support selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_track_print_status -->
If track_status is `true`, the print operation will try to continue report
on the status of the print job in the printer queues and printer. This
can allow your application to show things like “out of paper” issues,
and when the print job actually reaches the printer.

This function is often implemented using some form of polling, so it should
not be enabled unless needed.
## `track_status`
`true` to track status after printing
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_unit -->
Sets up the transformation for the cairo context obtained from
`PrintContext` in such a way that distances are measured in
units of `unit`.
## `unit`
the unit to use
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_use_full_page -->
If `full_page` is `true`, the transformation for the cairo context
obtained from `PrintContext` puts the origin at the top left
corner of the page (which may not be the top left corner of the
sheet, depending on page orientation and the number of pages per
sheet). Otherwise, the origin is at the top left corner of the
imageable area (i.e. inside the margins).
## `full_page`
`true` to set up the `PrintContext` for the full page
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_begin_print -->
Emitted after the user has finished changing print settings
in the dialog, before the actual rendering starts.

A typical use for ::begin-print is to use the parameters from the
`PrintContext` and paginate the document accordingly, and then
set the number of pages with `PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages`.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_create_custom_widget -->
Emitted when displaying the print dialog. If you return a
widget in a handler for this signal it will be added to a custom
tab in the print dialog. You typically return a container widget
with multiple widgets in it.

The print dialog owns the returned widget, and its lifetime is not
controlled by the application. However, the widget is guaranteed
to stay around until the `PrintOperation::custom-widget-apply`
signal is emitted on the operation. Then you can read out any
information you need from the widgets.

# Returns

A custom widget that gets embedded in
 the print dialog, or `None`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_custom_widget_apply -->
Emitted right before `PrintOperation::begin-print` if you added
a custom widget in the `PrintOperation::create-custom-widget` handler.
When you get this signal you should read the information from the
custom widgets, as the widgets are not guaraneed to be around at a
later time.
## `widget`
the custom widget added in create-custom-widget
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_done -->
Emitted when the print operation run has finished doing
everything required for printing.

`result` gives you information about what happened during the run.
If `result` is `PrintOperationResult::Error` then you can call
`PrintOperationExt::get_error` for more information.

If you enabled print status tracking then
`PrintOperationExt::is_finished` may still return `false`
after `PrintOperation::done` was emitted.
## `result`
the result of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_draw_page -->
Emitted for every page that is printed. The signal handler
must render the `page_nr`'s page onto the cairo context obtained
from `context` using `PrintContext::get_cairo_context`.

```C
static void
draw_page (GtkPrintOperation *operation,
           GtkPrintContext   *context,
           gint               page_nr,
           gpointer           user_data)
{
  cairo_t *cr;
  PangoLayout *layout;
  gdouble width, text_height;
  gint layout_height;
  PangoFontDescription *desc;
  
  cr = gtk_print_context_get_cairo_context (context);
  width = gtk_print_context_get_width (context);
  
  cairo_rectangle (cr, 0, 0, width, HEADER_HEIGHT);
  
  cairo_set_source_rgb (cr, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8);
  cairo_fill (cr);
  
  layout = gtk_print_context_create_pango_layout (context);
  
  desc = pango_font_description_from_string ("sans 14");
  pango_layout_set_font_description (layout, desc);
  pango_font_description_free (desc);
  
  pango_layout_set_text (layout, "some text", -1);
  pango_layout_set_width (layout, width * PANGO_SCALE);
  pango_layout_set_alignment (layout, PANGO_ALIGN_CENTER);
                   
  pango_layout_get_size (layout, NULL, &layout_height);
  text_height = (gdouble)layout_height / PANGO_SCALE;
  
  cairo_move_to (cr, width / 2,  (HEADER_HEIGHT - text_height) / 2);
  pango_cairo_show_layout (cr, layout);
  
  g_object_unref (layout);
}
```

Use `PrintOperationExt::set_use_full_page` and
`PrintOperationExt::set_unit` before starting the print operation
to set up the transformation of the cairo context according to your
needs.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
## `page_nr`
the number of the currently printed page (0-based)
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_end_print -->
Emitted after all pages have been rendered.
A handler for this signal can clean up any resources that have
been allocated in the `PrintOperation::begin-print` handler.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_paginate -->
Emitted after the `PrintOperation::begin-print` signal, but before
the actual rendering starts. It keeps getting emitted until a connected
signal handler returns `true`.

The ::paginate signal is intended to be used for paginating a document
in small chunks, to avoid blocking the user interface for a long
time. The signal handler should update the number of pages using
`PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages`, and return `true` if the document
has been completely paginated.

If you don't need to do pagination in chunks, you can simply do
it all in the ::begin-print handler, and set the number of pages
from there.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation

# Returns

`true` if pagination is complete
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_preview -->
Gets emitted when a preview is requested from the native dialog.

The default handler for this signal uses an external viewer
application to preview.

To implement a custom print preview, an application must return
`true` from its handler for this signal. In order to use the
provided `context` for the preview implementation, it must be
given a suitable cairo context with `PrintContext::set_cairo_context`.

The custom preview implementation can use
`PrintOperationPreview::is_selected` and
`PrintOperationPreview::render_page` to find pages which
are selected for print and render them. The preview must be
finished by calling `PrintOperationPreview::end_preview`
(typically in response to the user clicking a close button).
## `preview`
the `PrintOperationPreview` for the current operation
## `context`
the `PrintContext` that will be used
## `parent`
the `Window` to use as window parent, or `None`

# Returns

`true` if the listener wants to take over control of the preview
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_request_page_setup -->
Emitted once for every page that is printed, to give
the application a chance to modify the page setup. Any changes
done to `setup` will be in force only for printing this page.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
## `page_nr`
the number of the currently printed page (0-based)
## `setup`
the `PageSetup`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_status_changed -->
Emitted at between the various phases of the print operation.
See `PrintStatus` for the phases that are being discriminated.
Use `PrintOperationExt::get_status` to find out the current
status.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_update_custom_widget -->
Emitted after change of selected printer. The actual page setup and
print settings are passed to the custom widget, which can actualize
itself according to this change.
## `widget`
the custom widget added in create-custom-widget
## `setup`
actual page setup
## `settings`
actual print settings
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_allow_async -->
Determines whether the print operation may run asynchronously or not.

Some systems don't support asynchronous printing, but those that do
will return `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` as the status, and
emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when the operation is actually
done.

The Windows port does not support asynchronous operation at all (this
is unlikely to change). On other platforms, all actions except for
`PrintOperationAction::Export` support asynchronous operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_allow_async -->
Determines whether the print operation may run asynchronously or not.

Some systems don't support asynchronous printing, but those that do
will return `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` as the status, and
emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when the operation is actually
done.

The Windows port does not support asynchronous operation at all (this
is unlikely to change). On other platforms, all actions except for
`PrintOperationAction::Export` support asynchronous operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_current_page -->
The current page in the document.

If this is set before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_current_page -->
The current page in the document.

If this is set before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_custom_tab_label -->
Used as the label of the tab containing custom widgets.
Note that this property may be ignored on some platforms.

If this is `None`, GTK+ uses a default label.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_custom_tab_label -->
Used as the label of the tab containing custom widgets.
Note that this property may be ignored on some platforms.

If this is `None`, GTK+ uses a default label.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_default_page_setup -->
The `PageSetup` used by default.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,
but it can be overridden on a per-page basis by connecting
to the `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` signal.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_default_page_setup -->
The `PageSetup` used by default.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,
but it can be overridden on a per-page basis by connecting
to the `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` signal.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_embed_page_setup -->
If `true`, page size combo box and orientation combo box are embedded into page setup page.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_embed_page_setup -->
If `true`, page size combo box and orientation combo box are embedded into page setup page.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_export_filename -->
The name of a file to generate instead of showing the print dialog.
Currently, PDF is the only supported format.

The intended use of this property is for implementing
“Export to PDF” actions.

“Print to PDF” support is independent of this and is done
by letting the user pick the “Print to PDF” item from the
list of printers in the print dialog.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_export_filename -->
The name of a file to generate instead of showing the print dialog.
Currently, PDF is the only supported format.

The intended use of this property is for implementing
“Export to PDF” actions.

“Print to PDF” support is independent of this and is done
by letting the user pick the “Print to PDF” item from the
list of printers in the print dialog.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_has_selection -->
Determines whether there is a selection in your application.
This can allow your application to print the selection.
This is typically used to make a "Selection" button sensitive.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_has_selection -->
Determines whether there is a selection in your application.
This can allow your application to print the selection.
This is typically used to make a "Selection" button sensitive.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_job_name -->
A string used to identify the job (e.g. in monitoring
applications like eggcups).

If you don't set a job name, GTK+ picks a default one
by numbering successive print jobs.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_job_name -->
A string used to identify the job (e.g. in monitoring
applications like eggcups).

If you don't set a job name, GTK+ picks a default one
by numbering successive print jobs.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_n_pages -->
The number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal hander.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_n_pages -->
The number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal hander.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_n_pages_to_print -->
The number of pages that will be printed.

Note that this value is set during print preparation phase
(`PrintStatus::Preparing`), so this value should never be
get before the data generation phase (`PrintStatus::GeneratingData`).
You can connect to the `PrintOperation::status-changed` signal
and call `PrintOperationExt::get_n_pages_to_print` when
print status is `PrintStatus::GeneratingData`.
This is typically used to track the progress of print operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_print_settings -->
The `PrintSettings` used for initializing the dialog.

Setting this property is typically used to re-establish
print settings from a previous print operation, see
`PrintOperationExt::run`.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_print_settings -->
The `PrintSettings` used for initializing the dialog.

Setting this property is typically used to re-establish
print settings from a previous print operation, see
`PrintOperationExt::run`.

status e.g. in a `Statusbar`.

See the `PrintOperation:status` property for a status value that
is suitable for programmatic use.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_support_selection -->
If `true`, the print operation will support print of selection.
This allows the print dialog to show a "Selection" button.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_support_selection -->
If `true`, the print operation will support print of selection.
This allows the print dialog to show a "Selection" button.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_track_print_status -->
If `true`, the print operation will try to continue report on
the status of the print job in the printer queues and printer.
This can allow your application to show things like “out of paper”
issues, and when the print job actually reaches the printer.
However, this is often implemented using polling, and should
not be enabled unless needed.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_track_print_status -->
If `true`, the print operation will try to continue report on
the status of the print job in the printer queues and printer.
This can allow your application to show things like “out of paper”
issues, and when the print job actually reaches the printer.
However, this is often implemented using polling, and should
not be enabled unless needed.

from `PrintContext` puts the origin at the top left corner
of the page (which may not be the top left corner of the sheet,
depending on page orientation and the number of pages per sheet).
Otherwise, the origin is at the top left corner of the imageable
area (i.e. inside the margins).
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_use_full_page -->
If `true`, the transformation for the cairo context obtained
from `PrintContext` puts the origin at the top left corner
of the page (which may not be the top left corner of the sheet,

<!-- trait PrintOperationPreviewExt::fn render_page -->
Renders a page to the preview, using the print context that
was passed to the `PrintOperation::preview` handler together

<!-- trait PrintOperationPreviewExt::fn connect_got_page_size -->
The ::got-page-size signal is emitted once for each page
that gets rendered to the preview.

according to `page_setup` and set up a suitable cairo
context, using `PrintContext::set_cairo_context`.
## `context`
the current `PrintContext`
## `page_setup`
the `PageSetup` for the current page
<!-- trait PrintOperationPreviewExt::fn connect_ready -->
The ::ready signal gets emitted once per preview operation,
before the first page is rendered.

A handler for this signal can be used for setup tasks.

<!-- struct PrintSettings -->
A `PrintSettings` object represents the settings of a print dialog in
a system-independent way. The main use for this object is that once
you’ve printed you can get a settings object that represents the settings
the user chose, and the next time you print you can pass that object in so
that the user doesn’t have to re-set all his settings.

Its also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can easily save
the settings for the next time your app runs, or even store them in a
document. The predefined keys try to use shared values as much as possible
so that moving such a document between systems still works.

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

<!-- struct ProgressBar -->
The `ProgressBar` is typically used to display the progress of a long
running operation. It provides a visual clue that processing is underway.
The `ProgressBar` can be used in two different modes: percentage mode
and activity mode.

When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
(e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
progress, it can use the `ProgressBar` in percentage mode and the
user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
`ProgressBarExt::set_fraction` periodically to update the progress bar.

When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
to do, it can use the `ProgressBar` in activity mode, which shows
activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
this mode, the application is required to call `ProgressBarExt::pulse`
periodically to update the progress bar.

There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
of the `ProgressBar`. Functions are provided to control the orientation
of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
step size used in activity mode can be set.

# CSS nodes


```plain
progressbar[.osd]
├── [text]
╰── trough[.empty][.full]
    ╰── progress[.pulse]
```

`ProgressBar` has a main CSS node with name progressbar and subnodes with
names text and trough, of which the latter has a subnode named progress. The
text subnode is only present if text is shown. The progress subnode has the
style class .pulse when in activity mode. It gets the style classes .left,
.right, .top or .bottom added when the progress 'touches' the corresponding
end of the `ProgressBar`. The .osd class on the progressbar node is for use
in overlays like the one Epiphany has for page loading progress.

<!-- trait ProgressBarExt -->
Trait containing all `ProgressBar` methods.

# Implementors

[`ProgressBar`](struct.ProgressBar.html)
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `ProgressBar`.

# Returns

a `ProgressBar`.
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_ellipsize -->
Returns the ellipsizing position of the progress bar.
See `ProgressBarExt::set_ellipsize`.

# Returns

`pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_fraction -->
Returns the current fraction of the task that’s been completed.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `ProgressBarExt::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the progress bar is inverted
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_pulse_step -->
Retrieves the pulse step set with `ProgressBarExt::set_pulse_step`.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_show_text -->
Gets the value of the `ProgressBar:show-text` property.
See `ProgressBarExt::set_show_text`.

# Returns

`true` if text is shown in the progress bar
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the text that is displayed with the progress bar,
if any, otherwise `None`. The return value is a reference
to the text, not a copy of it, so will become invalid
if you change the text in the progress bar.

# Returns

text, or `None`; this string is owned by the widget
and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn pulse -->
Indicates that some progress has been made, but you don’t know how much.
Causes the progress bar to enter “activity mode,” where a block
bounces back and forth. Each call to `ProgressBarExt::pulse`
causes the block to move by a little bit (the amount of movement
per pulse is determined by `ProgressBarExt::set_pulse_step`).
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") the
text if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_fraction -->
Causes the progress bar to “fill in” the given fraction
of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_inverted -->
Progress bars normally grow from top to bottom or left to right.
Inverted progress bars grow in the opposite direction.
## `inverted`
`true` to invert the progress bar
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_pulse_step -->
Sets the fraction of total progress bar length to move the
bouncing block for each call to `ProgressBarExt::pulse`.
## `fraction`
fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show text next to the bar.
The shown text is either the value of the `ProgressBar:text`
property or, if that is `None`, the `ProgressBar:fraction` value,
as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for containing
text (even if the actual text is blank), set `ProgressBar:show-text` to
`true` and `ProgressBar:text` to the empty string (not `None`).
## `show_text`
whether to show text
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_text -->
Causes the given `text` to appear next to the progress bar.

If `text` is `None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the current
value of `ProgressBar:fraction` will be displayed as a percentage.

If `text` is non-`None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the text
will be displayed. In this case, it will not display the progress
percentage. If `text` is the empty string, the progress bar will still
be styled and sized suitably for containing text, as long as
`ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`.
## `text`
a UTF-8 string, or `None`
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the progress bar does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the progress bar requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis ("..."). Another means to set a
progress bar's width is `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the progress bar does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the progress bar requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis ("..."). Another means to set a
progress bar's width is `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn get_property_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show a text in addition
to the bar itself. The shown text is either the value of
the `ProgressBar:text` property or, if that is `None`,
the `ProgressBar:fraction` value, as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for
showing text (even if the actual text is blank), set
`ProgressBar:show-text` to `true` and `ProgressBar:text`
to the empty string (not `None`).
<!-- trait ProgressBarExt::fn set_property_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show a text in addition
to the bar itself. The shown text is either the value of
the `ProgressBar:text` property or, if that is `None`,
the `ProgressBar:fraction` value, as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for
showing text (even if the actual text is blank), set
`ProgressBar:show-text` to `true` and `ProgressBar:text`
to the empty string (not `None`).
<!-- enum PropagationPhase -->
Describes the stage at which events are fed into a `EventController`.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant None -->
Events are not delivered automatically. Those can be
 manually fed through `EventControllerExt::handle_event`. This should
 only be used when full control about when, or whether the controller
 handles the event is needed.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Capture -->
Events are delivered in the capture phase. The
 capture phase happens before the bubble phase, runs from the toplevel down
 to the event widget. This option should only be used on containers that
 might possibly handle events before their children do.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Bubble -->
Events are delivered in the bubble phase. The bubble
 phase happens after the capture phase, and before the default handlers
 are run. This phase runs from the event widget, up to the toplevel.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Target -->
Events are delivered in the default widget event handlers,
 note that widget implementations must chain up on button, motion, touch and
 grab broken handlers for controllers in this phase to be run.
<!-- struct RadioButton -->
A single radio button performs the same basic function as a `CheckButton`,
as its position in the object hierarchy reflects. It is only when multiple
radio buttons are grouped together that they become a different user
interface component in their own right.

Every radio button is a member of some group of radio buttons. When one is
selected, all other radio buttons in the same group are deselected. A
`RadioButton` is one way of giving the user a choice from many options.

Radio button widgets are created with `RadioButton::new`, passing `None`
as the argument if this is the first radio button in a group. In subsequent
calls, the group you wish to add this button to should be passed as an
argument. Optionally, `RadioButton::new_with_label` can be used if you
want a text label on the radio button.

Alternatively, when adding widgets to an existing group of radio buttons,
use `RadioButton::new_from_widget` with a `RadioButton` that already
has a group assigned to it. The convenience function
`RadioButton::new_with_label_from_widget` is also provided.

To retrieve the group a `RadioButton` is assigned to, use
`RadioButtonExt::get_group`.

To remove a `RadioButton` from one group and make it part of a new one,
use `RadioButton::set_group`.

The group list does not need to be freed, as each `RadioButton` will remove
itself and its list item when it is destroyed.

# CSS nodes


```plain
radiobutton
├── radio
╰── <child>
```

A `RadioButton` with indicator (see `CheckButtonExt::set_draw_indicator`)) has a
main CSS node with name radiobutton and a subnode with name radio.


```plain
button.radio
├── radio
╰── <child>
```

A `RadioButton` without indicator changes the name of its main node
to button and adds a .radio style class to it. The subnode is invisible
in this case.

## How to create a group of two radio buttons.


```C
void create_radio_buttons (void) {

   GtkWidget *window, *radio1, *radio2, *box, *entry;
   window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
   box = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 2);
   gtk_box_set_homogeneous (GTK_BOX (box), TRUE);

   // Create a radio button with a GtkEntry widget
   radio1 = gtk_radio_button_new (NULL);
   entry = gtk_entry_new ();
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (radio1), entry);


   // Create a radio button with a label
   radio2 = gtk_radio_button_new_with_label_from_widget (GTK_RADIO_BUTTON (radio1),
                                                         "I’m the second radio button.");

   // Pack them into a box, then show all the widgets
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), radio1);
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), radio2);
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), box);
   gtk_widget_show (window);
   return;
}
```

When an unselected button in the group is clicked the clicked button
receives the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal, as does the previously
selected button.
Inside the `ToggleButton::toggled` handler, `ToggleButtonExt::get_active`
can be used to determine if the button has been selected or deselected.

 radio button group, or `None` if you are creating a new group.

# Returns

a new radio button
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_from_widget -->
Creates a new `RadioButton`, adding it to the same group as
`radio_group_member`. As with `RadioButton::new`, a widget
should be packed into the radio button.
## `radio_group_member`
an existing `RadioButton`.

# Returns

a new radio button.
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` with a text label.
## `group`
an existing
 radio button group, or `None` if you are creating a new group.
## `label`
the text label to display next to the radio button.

# Returns

a new radio button.
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_label_from_widget -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` with a text label, adding it to
the same group as `radio_group_member`.
## `radio_group_member`
widget to get radio group from or `None`
## `label`
a text string to display next to the radio button.

# Returns

a new radio button.
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` containing a label, adding it to the same
group as `group`. The label will be created using
`Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores in `label` indicate the
mnemonic for the button.
## `group`
the radio button
 group, or `None`
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `RadioButton`
<!-- impl RadioButton::fn new_with_mnemonic_from_widget -->
Creates a new `RadioButton` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the button.
## `radio_group_member`
widget to get radio group from or `None`
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

<!-- trait RadioButtonExt::fn get_group -->
Retrieves the group assigned to a radio button.

# Returns

a linked list
containing all the radio buttons in the same group
as `self`. The returned list is owned by the radio button
and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait RadioButtonExt::fn join_group -->
Joins a `RadioButton` object to the group of another `RadioButton` object

Use this in language bindings instead of the `RadioButtonExt::get_group`
and `RadioButton::set_group` methods

A common way to set up a group of radio buttons is the following:

```C
  GtkRadioButton *radio_button;
  GtkRadioButton *last_button;

  while (some_condition)
    {
       radio_button = gtk_radio_button_new (NULL);

       gtk_radio_button_join_group (radio_button, last_button);
       last_button = radio_button;
    }
```
## `group_source`
a radio button object whos group we are
 joining, or `None` to remove the radio button from its group
<!-- trait RadioButtonExt::fn set_group -->
Sets a `RadioButton`’s group. It should be noted that this does not change
the layout of your interface in any way, so if you are changing the group,
it is likely you will need to re-arrange the user interface to reflect these
changes.
## `group`
an existing radio
 button group, such as one returned from `RadioButtonExt::get_group`, or `None`.
<!-- trait RadioButtonExt::fn connect_group_changed -->
Emitted when the group of radio buttons that a radio button belongs
to changes. This is emitted when a radio button switches from
being alone to being part of a group of 2 or more buttons, or
vice-versa, and when a button is moved from one group of 2 or
more buttons to a different one, but not when the composition
of the group that a button belongs to changes.
<!-- trait RadioButtonExt::fn set_property_group -->
Sets a new group for a radio button.
<!-- struct RadioMenuItem -->
A radio menu item is a check menu item that belongs to a group. At each
instant exactly one of the radio menu items from a group is selected.

The group list does not need to be freed, as each `RadioMenuItem` will
remove itself and its list item when it is destroyed.

The correct way to create a group of radio menu items is approximatively
this:

## How to create a group of radio menu items.


```C
GSList *group = NULL;
GtkWidget *item;
gint i;

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
  item = gtk_radio_menu_item_new_with_label (group, "This is an example");
  group = gtk_radio_menu_item_get_group (GTK_RADIO_MENU_ITEM (item));
  if (i == 1)
    gtk_check_menu_item_set_active (GTK_CHECK_MENU_ITEM (item), TRUE);
}
```

# CSS nodes


```plain
menuitem
├── radio.left

`RadioMenuItem` has a main CSS node with name menuitem, and a subnode
with name radio, which gets the .left or .right style class.

<!-- struct RadioToolButton -->
A `RadioToolButton` is a `ToolItem` that contains a radio button,
that is, a button that is part of a group of toggle buttons where only
one button can be active at a time.

Use `RadioToolButton::new` to create a new `RadioToolButton`. Use
`RadioToolButton::new_from_widget` to create a new `RadioToolButton`
that is part of the same group as an existing `RadioToolButton`.

<!-- struct Range -->
`Range` is the common base class for widgets which visualize an
adjustment, e.g `Scale` or `Scrollbar`.

Apart from signals for monitoring the parameters of the adjustment,
`Range` provides properties and methods for setting a
“fill level” on range widgets. See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.

# Implements

[`RangeExt`](trait.RangeExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt -->
Trait containing all `Range` methods.

# Implementors

[`Range`](struct.Range.html), [`Scale`](struct.Scale.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_adjustment -->
Get the `Adjustment` which is the “model” object for `Range`.
See `RangeExt::set_adjustment` for details.
The return value does not have a reference added, so should not
be unreferenced.

# Returns

a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_fill_level -->
Gets the current position of the fill level indicator.

# Returns

The current fill level
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_flippable -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_flippable`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is inverted
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_range_rect -->
This function returns the area that contains the range’s trough,
in coordinates relative to `self`'s origin.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `range_rect`
return location for the range rectangle
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range is restricted to the fill level.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is restricted to the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_round_digits -->
Gets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.

# Returns

the number of digits to round to
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_show_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range displays the fill level graphically.

# Returns

`true` if `self` shows the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_range -->
This function returns sliders range along the long dimension,
in widget->window coordinates.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `slider_start`
return location for the slider's
 start, or `None`
## `slider_end`
return location for the slider's
 end, or `None`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_size_fixed -->
This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.

See `RangeExt::set_slider_size_fixed`.

# Returns

whether the range’s slider has a fixed size.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the range.

# Returns

current value of the range.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment to be used as the “model” object for this range
widget. The adjustment indicates the current range value, the
minimum and maximum range values, the step/page increments used
for keybindings and scrolling, and the page size. The page size
is normally 0 for `Scale` and nonzero for `Scrollbar`, and
indicates the size of the visible area of the widget being scrolled.
The page size affects the size of the scrollbar slider.
## `adjustment`
a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_fill_level -->
Set the new position of the fill level indicator.

The “fill level” is probably best described by its most prominent
use case, which is an indicator for the amount of pre-buffering in
a streaming media player. In that use case, the value of the range
would indicate the current play position, and the fill level would
be the position up to which the file/stream has been downloaded.

This amount of prebuffering can be displayed on the range’s trough
and is themeable separately from the trough. To enable fill level
display, use `RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`. The range defaults
to not showing the fill level.

Additionally, it’s possible to restrict the range’s slider position
to values which are smaller than the fill level. This is controller
by `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level` and is by default
enabled.
## `fill_level`
the new position of the fill level indicator
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_flippable -->
If a range is flippable, it will switch its direction if it is
horizontal and its direction is `TextDirection::Rtl`.

See `WidgetExt::get_direction`.
## `flippable`
`true` to make the range flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_increments -->
Sets the step and page sizes for the range.
The step size is used when the user clicks the `Scrollbar`
arrows or moves `Scale` via arrow keys. The page size
is used for example when moving via Page Up or Page Down keys.
## `step`
step size
## `page`
page size
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_inverted -->
Ranges normally move from lower to higher values as the
slider moves from top to bottom or left to right. Inverted
ranges have higher values at the top or on the right rather than
on the bottom or left.
## `setting`
`true` to invert the range
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_range -->
Sets the allowable values in the `Range`, and clamps the range
value to be between `min` and `max`. (If the range has a non-zero
page size, it is clamped between `min` and `max` - page-size.)
## `min`
minimum range value
## `max`
maximum range value
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Sets whether the slider is restricted to the fill level. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `restrict_to_fill_level`
Whether the fill level restricts slider movement.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_round_digits -->
Sets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.
## `round_digits`
the precision in digits, or -1
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_show_fill_level -->
Sets whether a graphical fill level is show on the trough. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `show_fill_level`
Whether a fill level indicator graphics is shown.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_slider_size_fixed -->
Sets whether the range’s slider has a fixed size, or a size that
depends on its adjustment’s page size.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `size_fixed`
`true` to make the slider size constant
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the current value of the range; if the value is outside the
minimum or maximum range values, it will be clamped to fit inside
them. The range emits the `Range::value-changed` signal if the
value changes.
## `value`
new value of the range
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_adjust_bounds -->
Emitted before clamping a value, to give the application a
chance to adjust the bounds.
## `value`
the value before we clamp
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_change_value -->
The `Range::change-value` signal is emitted when a scroll action is
performed on a range. It allows an application to determine the
type of scroll event that occurred and the resultant new value.
The application can handle the event itself and return `true` to
prevent further processing. Or, by returning `false`, it can pass
the event to other handlers until the default GTK+ handler is
reached.

The value parameter is unrounded. An application that overrides
the `Range`::change-value signal is responsible for clamping the
value to the desired number of decimal digits; the default GTK+
handler clamps the value based on `Range:round-digits`.
## `scroll`
the type of scroll action that was performed
## `value`
the new value resulting from the scroll action

# Returns

`true` to prevent other handlers from being invoked for
 the signal, `false` to propagate the signal further
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_move_slider -->

See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_property_restrict_to_fill_level -->
The restrict-to-fill-level property controls whether slider
movement is restricted to an upper boundary set by the
fill level. See `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_property_restrict_to_fill_level -->
The restrict-to-fill-level property controls whether slider
movement is restricted to an upper boundary set by the

<!-- struct RecentManager -->
`RecentManager` provides a facility for adding, removing and
looking up recently used files. Each recently used file is
identified by its URI, and has meta-data associated to it, like
the names and command lines of the applications that have
registered it, the number of time each application has registered
the same file, the mime type of the file and whether the file
should be displayed only by the applications that have
registered it.

The recently used files list is per user.

The `RecentManager` acts like a database of all the recently
used files. You can create new `RecentManager` objects, but
it is more efficient to use the default manager created by GTK+.

Adding a new recently used file is as simple as:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
gtk_recent_manager_add_item (manager, file_uri);
```

The `RecentManager` will try to gather all the needed information
from the file itself through GIO.

Looking up the meta-data associated with a recently used file
given its URI requires calling `RecentManagerExt::lookup_item`:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;
GtkRecentInfo *info;
GError *error = NULL;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
info = gtk_recent_manager_lookup_item (manager, file_uri, &error);
if (error)
  {
    g_warning ("Could not find the file: %s", error->message);
    g_error_free (error);
  }
else
 {
   // Use the info object
   gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
 }
```

In order to retrieve the list of recently used files, you can use
`RecentManagerExt::get_items`, which returns a list of `RecentInfo`-structs.

A `RecentManager` is the model used to populate the contents of
one, or more ``GtkRecentChooser`` implementations.

Note that the maximum age of the recently used files list is
controllable through the `Settings:gtk-recent-files-max-age`
property.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

# Implements

[`RecentManagerExt`](trait.RecentManagerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt -->
Trait containing all `RecentManager` methods.

# Implementors

[`RecentManager`](struct.RecentManager.html)
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn new -->
Creates a new recent manager object. Recent manager objects are used to
handle the list of recently used resources. A `RecentManager` object
monitors the recently used resources list, and emits the “changed” signal
each time something inside the list changes.

`RecentManager` objects are expensive: be sure to create them only when
needed. You should use `RecentManager::get_default` instead.

# Returns

A newly created `RecentManager` object
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn get_default -->
Gets a unique instance of `RecentManager`, that you can share
in your application without caring about memory management.

# Returns

A unique `RecentManager`. Do not ref or
 unref it.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn add_full -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list, using the metadata specified inside the
`RecentData`-struct passed in `recent_data`.

The passed URI will be used to identify this resource inside the
list.

In order to register the new recently used resource, metadata about
the resource must be passed as well as the URI; the metadata is
stored in a `RecentData`-struct, which must contain the MIME
type of the resource pointed by the URI; the name of the application
that is registering the item, and a command line to be used when
launching the item.

Optionally, a `RecentData`-struct might contain a UTF-8 string
to be used when viewing the item instead of the last component of
the URI; a short description of the item; whether the item should
be considered private - that is, should be displayed only by the
applications that have registered it.
## `uri`
a valid URI
## `recent_data`
metadata of the resource

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added to the
 recently used resources list, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn add_item -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list.

This function automatically retrieves some of the needed
metadata and setting other metadata to common default values;
it then feeds the data to `RecentManagerExt::add_full`.

See `RecentManagerExt::add_full` if you want to explicitly
define the metadata for the resource pointed by `uri`.
## `uri`
a valid URI

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added
 to the recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn get_items -->

<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn has_item -->
Checks whether there is a recently used resource registered
with `uri` inside the recent manager.
## `uri`
a URI

# Returns

`true` if the resource was found, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn lookup_item -->
Searches for a URI inside the recently used resources list, and
returns a `RecentInfo`-struct containing informations about the resource
like its MIME type, or its display name.
## `uri`
a URI

# Returns

a `RecentInfo`-struct containing information
 about the resource pointed by `uri`, or `None` if the URI was
 not registered in the recently used resources list. Free with
 `RecentInfo::unref`.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn move_item -->
Changes the location of a recently used resource from `uri` to `new_uri`.

Please note that this function will not affect the resource pointed
by the URIs, but only the URI used in the recently used resources list.
## `uri`
the URI of a recently used resource
## `new_uri`
the new URI of the recently used resource, or
 `None` to remove the item pointed by `uri` in the list

# Returns

`true` on success
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn purge_items -->
Purges every item from the recently used resources list.

# Returns

the number of items that have been removed from the
 recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn remove_item -->
Removes a resource pointed by `uri` from the recently used resources
list handled by a recent manager.
## `uri`
the URI of the item you wish to remove

# Returns

`true` if the item pointed by `uri` has been successfully
 removed by the recently used resources list, and `false` otherwise

<!-- struct Revealer -->
The `Revealer` widget is a container which animates
the transition of its child from invisible to visible.

The style of transition can be controlled with
`RevealerExt::set_transition_type`.

These animations respect the `Settings:gtk-enable-animations`
setting.

# CSS nodes

`Revealer` has a single CSS node with name revealer.
When styling `Revealer` using CSS, remember that it only hides its contents,
not itself. That means applied margin, padding and borders will be
visible even when the `Revealer:reveal-child` property is set to `false`.

The `Revealer` widget was added in GTK+ 3.10.

<!-- trait RevealerExt::fn get_reveal_child -->
Returns whether the child is currently
revealed. See `RevealerExt::set_reveal_child`.

This function returns `true` as soon as the transition
is to the revealed state is started. To learn whether
the child is fully revealed (ie the transition is completed),
use `RevealerExt::get_child_revealed`.

# Returns

`true` if the child is revealed.

<!-- struct Root -->
`Root` is the interface implemented by all widgets that can act as a toplevel
widget to a hierarchy of widgets. The root widget takes care of providing the
connection to the windowing system and manages layout, drawing and event delivery
for its widget hierarchy.

The obvious example of a `Root` is `Window`.

<!-- impl Root::fn get_for_surface -->
Finds the `Root` associated with the surface.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`

# Returns

the `Root` that is associated with `surface`
<!-- trait RootExt::fn get_focus -->
Retrieves the current focused widget within the root.

Note that this is the widget that would have the focus
if the root is active; if the root is not focused then
`gtk_widget_has_focus (widget)` will be `false` for the
widget.

# Returns

the currently focused widget,
 or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait RootExt::fn set_focus -->
If `focus` is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets
it as the focus widget for the root. If `focus` is `None`, unsets
the focus widget for the root.

To set the focus to a particular widget in the root, it is usually
more convenient to use `WidgetExt::grab_focus` instead of this function.
## `focus`
widget to be the new focus widget, or `None`
 to unset the focus widget
<!-- struct Scale -->
A `Scale` is a slider control used to select a numeric value.
To use it, you’ll probably want to investigate the methods on
its base class, `Range`, in addition to the methods for `Scale` itself.
To set the value of a scale, you would normally use `RangeExt::set_value`.
To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the
`Range::value-changed` signal.

Note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the `Scale` (through
the `Range` methods) will hide the slider itself. This is useful for
applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale, without
changing the layout of the application (such as movie or music players).

# `Scale` as `Buildable`

`Scale` supports a custom `<marks>` element, which can contain multiple
`<mark>` elements. The “value” and “position” attributes have the same
meaning as `ScaleExt::add_mark` parameters of the same name. If the
element is not empty, its content is taken as the markup to show at
the mark. It can be translated with the usual ”translatable” and
“context” attributes.

# CSS nodes


```plain
scale[.fine-tune][.marks-before][.marks-after]
├── marks.top
│   ├── mark
│   ┊    ├── [label]
│   ┊    ╰── indicator
┊   ┊
│   ╰── mark
├── [value][.top][.bottom]
├── trough
│   ├── [fill]
│   ├── [highlight]
│   ╰── slider
╰── marks.bottom
    ├── mark
    ┊    ├── indicator
    ┊    ╰── [label]
    ╰── mark
```

`Scale` has a main CSS node with name scale and a subnode for its contents,
with subnodes named trough and slider.

The main node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scale is in
'fine-tuning' mode.

If the scale has an origin (see `ScaleExt::set_has_origin`), there is a
subnode with name highlight below the trough node that is used for rendering
the highlighted part of the trough.

If the scale is showing a fill level (see `RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`),
there is a subnode with name fill below the trough node that is used for
rendering the filled in part of the trough.

If marks are present, there is a marks subnode before or after the trough
node, below which each mark gets a node with name mark. The marks nodes get
either the .top or .bottom style class.

The mark node has a subnode named indicator. If the mark has text, it also
has a subnode named label. When the mark is either above or left of the
scale, the label subnode is the first when present. Otherwise, the indicator
subnode is the first.

The main CSS node gets the 'marks-before' and/or 'marks-after' style classes
added depending on what marks are present.

If the scale is displaying the value (see `Scale:draw-value`), there is
subnode with name value. This node will get the .top or .bottom style classes
similar to the marks node.

<!-- trait ScaleExt -->
Trait containing all `Scale` methods.

# Implementors

[`Scale`](struct.Scale.html)
<!-- impl Scale::fn new -->
Creates a new `Scale`.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `adjustment`
the `Adjustment` which sets the range
 of the scale, or `None` to create a new adjustment.

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- impl Scale::fn new_with_range -->
Creates a new scale widget with the given orientation that lets the
user input a number between `min` and `max` (including `min` and `max`)
with the increment `step`. `step` must be nonzero; it’s the distance
the slider moves when using the arrow keys to adjust the scale
value.

Note that the way in which the precision is derived works best if `step`
is a power of ten. If the resulting precision is not suitable for your
needs, use `ScaleExt::set_digits` to correct it.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `min`
minimum value
## `max`
maximum value
## `step`
step increment (tick size) used with keyboard shortcuts

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn add_mark -->
Adds a mark at `value`.

A mark is indicated visually by drawing a tick mark next to the scale,
and GTK+ makes it easy for the user to position the scale exactly at the
marks value.

If `markup` is not `None`, text is shown next to the tick mark.

To remove marks from a scale, use `ScaleExt::clear_marks`.
## `value`
the value at which the mark is placed, must be between
 the lower and upper limits of the scales’ adjustment
## `position`
where to draw the mark. For a horizontal scale, `PositionType::Top`
 and `PositionType::Left` are drawn above the scale, anything else below.
 For a vertical scale, `PositionType::Left` and `PositionType::Top` are drawn to
 the left of the scale, anything else to the right.
## `markup`
Text to be shown at the mark, using [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat], or `None`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn clear_marks -->
Removes any marks that have been added with `ScaleExt::add_mark`.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_digits -->
Gets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value.

# Returns

the number of decimal places that are displayed
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_draw_value -->
Returns whether the current value is displayed as a string
next to the slider.

# Returns

whether the current value is displayed as a string
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_has_origin -->
Returns whether the scale has an origin.

# Returns

`true` if the scale has an origin.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the scale. The returned
object is owned by the scale so does not need to be freed by
the caller.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this scale,
 or `None` if the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the scale will draw the
`pango::Layout` representing the text in the scale. Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` function you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.

If the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`, the return
values are undefined.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_value_pos -->
Gets the position in which the current value is displayed.

# Returns

the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_digits -->
Sets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value. Also
causes the value of the adjustment to be rounded to this number of digits,
so the retrieved value matches the displayed one, if `Scale:draw-value` is
`true` when the value changes. If you want to enforce rounding the value when
`Scale:draw-value` is `false`, you can set `Range:round-digits` instead.

Note that rounding to a small number of digits can interfere with
the smooth autoscrolling that is built into `Scale`. As an alternative,
you can use the `Scale::format-value` signal to format the displayed
value yourself.
## `digits`
the number of decimal places to display,
 e.g. use 1 to display 1.0, 2 to display 1.00, etc
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_draw_value -->
Specifies whether the current value is displayed as a string next
to the slider.
## `draw_value`
`true` to draw the value
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_has_origin -->
If `Scale:has-origin` is set to `true` (the default), the scale will
highlight the part of the trough between the origin (bottom or left side)
and the current value.
## `has_origin`
`true` if the scale has an origin
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_value_pos -->
Sets the position in which the current value is displayed.
## `pos`
the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn connect_format_value -->
Signal which allows you to change how the scale value is displayed.
Connect a signal handler which returns an allocated string representing
`value`. That string will then be used to display the scale's value.

If no user-provided handlers are installed, the value will be displayed on
its own, rounded according to the value of the `Scale:digits` property.

Here's an example signal handler which displays a value 1.0 as
with "-->1.0<--".

```C
static gchar*
format_value_callback (GtkScale *scale,
                       gdouble   value)
{
  return g_strdup_printf ("-->\%0.*g<--",
                          gtk_scale_get_digits (scale), value);
 }
```
## `value`
the value to format

# Returns

allocated string representing `value`
<!-- struct ScaleButton -->
`ScaleButton` provides a button which pops up a scale widget.
This kind of widget is commonly used for volume controls in multimedia
applications, and GTK+ provides a `VolumeButton` subclass that
is tailored for this use case.

# CSS nodes

`ScaleButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .scale style class.

For details, see the `ScaleButton:icons` property.
## `icons`
a `None`-terminated array of icon names
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the current value of the scale; if the value is outside
the minimum or maximum range values, it will be clamped to fit
inside them. The scale button emits the `ScaleButton::value-changed`
signal if the value changes.
## `value`

<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn connect_popup -->
The ::popup signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to popup the scale widget.

The default bindings for this signal are Space, Enter and Return.
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
The ::value-changed signal is emitted when the value field has
changed.
## `value`
the new value
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn get_property_icons -->
The names of the icons to be used by the scale button.
The first item in the array will be used in the button
when the current value is the lowest value, the second
item for the highest value. All the subsequent icons will
be used for all the other values, spread evenly over the
range of values.

If there's only one icon name in the `icons` array, it will
be used for all the values. If only two icon names are in
the `icons` array, the first one will be used for the bottom
50% of the scale, and the second one for the top 50%.

It is recommended to use at least 3 icons so that the
`ScaleButton` reflects the current value of the scale
better for the users.

<!-- struct Scrollable -->
`Scrollable` is an interface that is implemented by widgets with native
scrolling ability.

To implement this interface you should override the
`Scrollable:hadjustment` and `Scrollable:vadjustment` properties.

## Creating a scrollable widget

All scrollable widgets should do the following.

- When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
 the widget should populate the adjustments’
 `Adjustment:lower`, `Adjustment:upper`,
 `Adjustment:step-increment`, `Adjustment:page-increment` and
 `Adjustment:page-size` properties and connect to the
 `Adjustment::value-changed` signal.

- Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
 the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
 This means that it must accept any value passed to its
 `WidgetClass.size_allocate`() function.

- When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
 the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.

- When any of the adjustments emits the `Adjustment::value-changed` signal,
 the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.

<!-- struct Scrollbar -->
The `Scrollbar` widget is a horizontal or vertical scrollbar,
depending on the value of the `Orientable:orientation` property.

Its position and movement are controlled by the adjustment that is passed to
or created by `Scrollbar::new`. See `Adjustment` for more details. The
`Adjustment:value` field sets the position of the thumb and must be between
`Adjustment:lower` and `Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page-size`. The
`Adjustment:page-size` represents the size of the visible scrollable area.
The fields `Adjustment:step-increment` and `Adjustment:page-increment`
fields are added to or subtracted from the `Adjustment:value` when the user
asks to move by a step (using e.g. the cursor arrow keys or, if present, the
stepper buttons) or by a page (using e.g. the Page Down/Up keys).

# CSS nodes


```plain
scrollbar
╰── box
    ╰── range[.fine-tune]
        ╰── trough
            ╰── slider
```

`Scrollbar` has a main CSS node with name scrollbar and a subnode for its
contents. Both the main node and the box subnode get the .horizontal or .vertical
style classes applied, depending on the scrollbar's orientation.

The range node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scrollbar is
in 'fine-tuning' mode.

If steppers are enabled, they are represented by up to four additional
subnodes with name button. These get the style classes .up and .down to
indicate in which direction they are moving.

Other style classes that may be added to scrollbars inside `ScrolledWindow`
include the positional classes (.left, .right, .top, .bottom) and style
classes related to overlay scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering).

<!-- struct ScrolledWindow -->
`ScrolledWindow` is a container that accepts a single child widget, makes
that child scrollable using either internally added scrollbars or externally
associated adjustments, and optionally draws a frame around the child.

Widgets with native scrolling support, i.e. those whose classes implement the
`Scrollable` interface, are added directly. For other types of widget, the
class `Viewport` acts as an adaptor, giving scrollability to other widgets.
`ScrolledWindow`’s implementation of `ContainerExt::add` intelligently
accounts for whether or not the added child is a `Scrollable`. If it isn’t,
`ScrolledWindow` wraps the child in a `Viewport` and adds that for you.
Therefore, you can just add any child widget and not worry about the details.

If `ContainerExt::add` has added a `Viewport` for you, you can remove
both your added child widget from the `Viewport`, and the `Viewport`
from the `ScrolledWindow`, like this:


```C
GtkWidget *scrolled_window = gtk_scrolled_window_new (NULL, NULL);
GtkWidget *child_widget = gtk_button_new ();

// GtkButton is not a GtkScrollable, so GtkScrolledWindow will automatically
// add a GtkViewport.
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (scrolled_window),
                   child_widget);

// Either of these will result in child_widget being unparented:
gtk_container_remove (GTK_CONTAINER (scrolled_window),
                      child_widget);
// or
gtk_container_remove (GTK_CONTAINER (scrolled_window),
                      gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (scrolled_window)));
```

Unless `ScrolledWindow:hscrolbar-policy` and `ScrolledWindow:vscrollbar-policy`
are GTK_POLICY_NEVER or GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL,
`ScrolledWindow` adds internal `Scrollbar` widgets around its child. The
scroll position of the child, and if applicable the scrollbars, is controlled
by the `ScrolledWindow:hadjustment` and `ScrolledWindow:vadjustment`
that are associated with the `ScrolledWindow`. See the docs on `Scrollbar`
for the details, but note that the “step_increment” and “page_increment”
fields are only effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.

If a `ScrolledWindow` doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
your own scrolling with `Scrollbar` and for example a `Grid`.

# Touch support

`ScrolledWindow` has built-in support for touch devices. When a
touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
`ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling` property if it is undesired.

`ScrolledWindow` also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
captured with the `ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.

If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlayed as
narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
can be turned off with the `ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling`
property.

# CSS nodes

`ScrolledWindow` has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.

It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to
draw the overflow and underflow indications. These nodes get
the .left, .right, .top or .bottom style class added depending
on where the indication is drawn.

`ScrolledWindow` also sets the positional style classes (.left,
.right, .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay
scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.

If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
with a subnode named junction.

# Implementors

[`ScrolledWindow`](struct.ScrolledWindow.html)
<!-- impl ScrolledWindow::fn new -->
Creates a new scrolled window.

The two arguments are the scrolled window’s adjustments; these will be
shared with the scrollbars and the child widget to keep the bars in sync
with the child. Usually you want to pass `None` for the adjustments, which
will cause the scrolled window to create them for you.
## `hadjustment`
horizontal adjustment
## `vadjustment`
vertical adjustment

# Returns

a new scrolled window
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn get_capture_button_press -->
Return whether button presses are captured during kinetic
scrolling. See `ScrolledWindowExt::set_capture_button_press`.

# Returns

the vertical scrollbar of the scrolled window.
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_capture_button_press -->
Changes the behaviour of `self` with regard to the initial
event that possibly starts kinetic scrolling. When `capture_button_press`
is set to `true`, the event is captured by the scrolled window, and
then later replayed if it is meant to go to the child widget.

This should be enabled if any child widgets perform non-reversible
actions on button press events. If they don't, and additionally handle
`Widget::grab-broken-event`, it might be better to set `capture_button_press`
to `false`.

This setting only has an effect if kinetic scrolling is enabled.

smaller than `ScrolledWindow:min-content-height`.
## `height`
the maximum content height
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_max_content_width -->
Sets the maximum width that `self` should keep visible. The
`self` will grow up to this width before it starts scrolling
the content.

It is a programming error to set the maximum content width to a value
smaller than `ScrolledWindow:min-content-width`.
## `width`
the maximum content width
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_min_content_height -->
Sets the minimum height that `self` should keep visible.
Note that this can and (usually will) be smaller than the minimum
size of the content.

It is a programming error to set the minimum content height to a
value greater than `ScrolledWindow:max-content-height`.
## `height`
the minimal content height
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_min_content_width -->
Sets the minimum width that `self` should keep visible.

Enables or disables overlay scrolling for this scrolled window.
## `overlay_scrolling`
whether to enable overlay scrolling
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_placement -->
Sets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars
for the scrolled window.

The default is `CornerType::TopLeft`, meaning the child is
in the top left, with the scrollbars underneath and to the right.
Other values in `CornerType` are `CornerType::TopRight`,
`CornerType::BottomLeft`, and `CornerType::BottomRight`.

See also `ScrolledWindowExt::get_placement` and
`ScrolledWindowExt::unset_placement`.
## `window_placement`
position of the child window
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_policy -->
Sets the scrollbar policy for the horizontal and vertical scrollbars.

The policy determines when the scrollbar should appear; it is a value
from the `PolicyType` enumeration. If `PolicyType::Always`, the
scrollbar is always present; if `PolicyType::Never`, the scrollbar is
never present; if `PolicyType::Automatic`, the scrollbar is present only
if needed (that is, if the slider part of the bar would be smaller
than the trough — the display is larger than the page size).
## `hscrollbar_policy`
policy for horizontal bar
## `vscrollbar_policy`
policy for vertical bar
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn set_propagate_natural_height -->
Sets whether the natural height of the child should be calculated and propagated
through the scrolled window’s requested natural height.
## `propagate`
whether to propagate natural height

Sets the `Adjustment` for the vertical scrollbar.
## `vadjustment`
vertical scroll adjustment
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn unset_placement -->
Unsets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars
for the scrolled window. If no window placement is set for a scrolled
window, it defaults to `CornerType::TopLeft`.

See also `ScrolledWindowExt::set_placement` and
`ScrolledWindowExt::get_placement`.
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn connect_edge_overshot -->
The ::edge-overshot signal is emitted whenever user initiated scrolling
makes the scrolled window firmly surpass (i.e. with some edge resistance)
the lower or upper limits defined by the adjustment in that orientation.

A similar behavior without edge resistance is provided by the
`ScrolledWindow::edge-reached` signal.

Note: The `pos` argument is LTR/RTL aware, so callers should be aware too
if intending to provide behavior on horizontal edges.
## `pos`
edge side that was hit
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn connect_edge_reached -->
The ::edge-reached signal is emitted whenever user-initiated scrolling
makes the scrolled window exactly reach the lower or upper limits
defined by the adjustment in that orientation.

A similar behavior with edge resistance is provided by the
`ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.

Note: The `pos` argument is LTR/RTL aware, so callers should be aware too
if intending to provide behavior on horizontal edges.
## `pos`
edge side that was reached
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn connect_move_focus_out -->
The ::move-focus-out signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`] which gets
emitted when focus is moved away from the scrolled window by a
keybinding. The `Widget::move-focus` signal is emitted with
`direction_type` on this scrolled window’s toplevel parent in the
container hierarchy. The default bindings for this signal are
`Ctrl + Tab` to move forward and `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` to move backward.
## `direction_type`
either `DirectionType::TabForward` or
 `DirectionType::TabBackward`
<!-- trait ScrolledWindowExt::fn connect_scroll_child -->
The ::scroll-child signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when a keybinding that scrolls is pressed.
The horizontal or vertical adjustment is updated which triggers a
signal that the scrolled window’s child may listen to and scroll itself.
## `scroll`
a `ScrollType` describing how much to scroll
## `horizontal`
whether the keybinding scrolls the child
 horizontally or not

enough space for the natural size of the child.
<!-- struct SearchBar -->
`SearchBar` is a container made to have a search entry (possibly
with additional connex widgets, such as drop-down menus, or buttons)
built-in. The search bar would appear when a search is started through
typing on the keyboard, or the application’s search mode is toggled on.

For keyboard presses to start a search, the search bar must be told
of a widget to capture key events from through
`SearchBarExt::set_key_capture_widget`. This widget will typically
be the top-level window, or a parent container of the search bar. Common
shortcuts such as Ctrl+F should be handled as an application action, or
through the menu items.

You will also need to tell the search bar about which entry you
are using as your search entry using `SearchBarExt::connect_entry`.
The following example shows you how to create a more complex search
entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
searchbar
╰── revealer
    ╰── box
         ├── [child]
         ╰── [button.close]
```

`SearchBar` has a main CSS node with name searchbar. It has a child node
with name revealer that contains a node with name box. The box node contains both the
CSS node of the child widget as well as an optional button node which gets the .close
style class applied.

# Implementors

[`SearchBar`](struct.SearchBar.html)
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn new -->
Creates a `SearchBar`. You will need to tell it about
which widget is going to be your text entry using
`SearchBarExt::connect_entry`.

# Returns

a new `SearchBar`
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn connect_entry -->
Connects the `Entry` widget passed as the one to be used in
this search bar. The entry should be a descendant of the search bar.
This is only required if the entry isn’t the direct child of the
search bar (as in our main example).
## `entry`
a `Editable`
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn get_key_capture_widget -->
Gets the widget that `self` is capturing key events from.

# Returns

The key capture widget.
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn get_search_mode -->
Returns whether the search mode is on or off.

# Returns

whether search mode is toggled on
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn get_show_close_button -->
Returns whether the close button is shown.

# Returns

whether the close button is shown
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn set_key_capture_widget -->
Sets `widget` as the widget that `self` will capture key events from.

If key events are handled by the search bar, the bar will
be shown, and the entry populated with the entered text.
## `widget`
a `Widget`
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn set_search_mode -->
Switches the search mode on or off.
## `search_mode`
the new state of the search mode
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn set_show_close_button -->
Shows or hides the close button. Applications that
already have a “search” toggle button should not show a close
button in their search bar, as it duplicates the role of the
toggle button.
## `visible`
whether the close button will be shown or not
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn get_property_search_mode_enabled -->
Whether the search mode is on and the search bar shown.

See `SearchBarExt::set_search_mode` for details.
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn set_property_search_mode_enabled -->
Whether the search mode is on and the search bar shown.

See `SearchBarExt::set_search_mode` for details.
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn get_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to show the close button in the search bar.
<!-- trait SearchBarExt::fn set_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to show the close button in the search bar.
<!-- struct SearchEntry -->
`SearchEntry` is a subclass of `Entry` that has been
tailored for use as a search entry.

It will show an inactive symbolic “find” icon when the search
entry is empty, and a symbolic “clear” icon when there is text.
Clicking on the “clear” icon will empty the search entry.

Note that the search/clear icon is shown using a secondary
icon, and thus does not work if you are using the secondary
icon position for some other purpose.

To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to
not react to every change in the entry text immediately, but
only after a short delay. To support this, `SearchEntry`
emits the `SearchEntry::search-changed` signal which can
be used instead of the `Editable::changed` signal.

The `SearchEntry::previous-match`, `SearchEntry::next-match`
and `SearchEntry::stop-search` signals can be used to implement
moving between search results and ending the search.

Often, `SearchEntry` will be fed events by means of being
placed inside a `SearchBar`. If that is not the case,
you can use `SearchEntryExt::set_key_capture_widget` to let it
capture key input from another widget.

Exactly one element is selected.
 In some circumstances, such as initially or during a search
 operation, it’s possible for no element to be selected with
 `SelectionMode::Browse`. What is really enforced is that the user
 can’t deselect a currently selected element except by selecting
 another element.
<!-- enum SelectionMode::variant Multiple -->
Any number of elements may be selected.
 The Ctrl key may be used to enlarge the selection, and Shift
 key to select between the focus and the child pointed to.
 Some widgets may also allow Click-drag to select a range of elements.
<!-- struct SelectionModel -->
`SelectionModel` is an interface that extends the `gio::ListModel` interface by adding
support for selections. This support is then used by widgets using list models to add
the ability to select and unselect various items.

GTK provides default implementations of the mode common selection modes such as
`SingleSelection`, so you will only need to implement this interface if you want
detailed control about how selections should be handled.

A `SelectionModel` supports a single boolean per row indicating if a row is selected
or not. This can be queried via `SelectionModel::is_selected`. When the selected
state of one or more rows changes, the model will emit the
`SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal by calling the
`SelectionModel::selection_changed` function. The positions given in that signal
may have their selection state changed, though that is not a requirement.
If new items added to the model via the `gio::ListModel::items-changed` signal are selected
or not is up to the implementation.

Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect items.
If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users to select and
unselect items. However, ``GtkSelectionModels`` are free to only implement them
partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not support the unimplemented
operations.

When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of the
selection functions do NOT indicate if selection or unselection happened. They are
only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of selecting is not
supported by the model.

Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out when an
item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.

# Implements

[`SelectionModelExt`](trait.SelectionModelExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt -->
Trait containing all `SelectionModel` methods.

# Implementors

[`SelectionModel`](struct.SelectionModel.html), [`SingleSelection`](struct.SingleSelection.html)
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn is_selected -->
Checks if the given item is selected.
## `position`
the position of the item to query

# Returns

`true` if the item is selected
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn query_range -->
This function allows to query the selection status of multiple elements at once.
It is passed a position and returns a range of elements of uniform selection status.

If `position` is greater than the number of items in `self`, `n_items` is set to 0.
Otherwise the returned range is guaranteed to include the passed-in position, so
`n_items` will be >= 1.

Positions directly adjacent to the returned range may have the same selection
status as the returned range.

This is an optimization function to make iterating over a model faster when few
items are selected. However, it is valid behavior for implementations to use a
naive implementation that only ever returns a single element.
## `position`
the position inside the range
## `start_range`
returns the position of the first element of the range
## `n_items`
returns the size of the range
## `selected`
returns whether items in `range` are selected
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_all -->
Requests to select all items in the model.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_item -->
Requests to select an item in the model.
## `position`
the position of the item to select
## `exclusive`
whether previously selected items should be unselected
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_range -->
Requests to select a range of items in the model.
## `position`
the first item to select
## `n_items`
the number of items to select
## `exclusive`
whether previously selected items should be unselected
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn selection_changed -->
Helper function for implementations of `SelectionModel`.
Call this when a the selection changes to emit the ::selection-changed
signal.
## `position`
the first changed item
## `n_items`
the number of changed items
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_all -->
Requests to unselect all items in the model.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_item -->
Requests to unselect an item in the model.
## `position`
the position of the item to unselect
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_range -->
Requests to unselect a range of items in the model.
## `position`
the first item to unselect
## `n_items`
the number of items to unselect
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn connect_selection_changed -->
Emitted when the selection state of some of the items in `model` changes.

Note that this signal does not specify the new selection state of the items,
they need to be queried manually.
It is also not necessary for a model to change the selection state of any of
the items in the selection model, though it would be rather useless to emit
such a signal.
## `position`
The first item that may have changed
## `n_items`
number of items with changes
<!-- enum SensitivityType -->

<!-- struct Separator -->
`Separator` is a horizontal or vertical separator widget, depending on the
value of the `Orientable:orientation` property, used to group the widgets
within a window. It displays a line with a shadow to make it appear sunken
into the interface.

# CSS nodes

`Separator` has a single CSS node with name separator. The node
gets one of the .horizontal or .vertical style classes.

<!-- struct SeparatorToolItem -->
A `SeparatorToolItem` is a `ToolItem` that separates groups of other
``GtkToolItems``. Depending on the theme, a `SeparatorToolItem` will
often look like a vertical line on horizontally docked toolbars.

If the `Toolbar` child property “expand” is `true` and the property
`SeparatorToolItem:draw` is `false`, a `SeparatorToolItem` will act as
a “spring” that forces other items to the ends of the toolbar.

Use `SeparatorToolItem::new` to create a new `SeparatorToolItem`.

<!-- struct Settings -->
`Settings` provide a mechanism to share global settings between
applications.

On the X window system, this sharing is realized by an
[XSettings](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec)
manager that is usually part of the desktop environment, along with
utilities that let the user change these settings. In the absence of
an Xsettings manager, GTK reads default values for settings from
`settings.ini` files in
`/etc/gtk-4.0`, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gtk-4.0`
and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0`.
These files must be valid key files (see `glib::KeyFile`), and have
a section called Settings. Themes can also provide default values
for settings by installing a `settings.ini` file
next to their `gtk.css` file.

Applications can override system-wide settings by setting the property
of the `Settings` object with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`. This should be restricted
to special cases though; `Settings` are not meant as an application
configuration facility.

There is one `Settings` instance per display. It can be obtained with
`Settings::get_for_display`, but in many cases, it is more convenient
to use `WidgetExt::get_settings`. `Settings::get_default` returns the
`Settings` instance for the default display.

Some applications benefit from minimizing the amount of light pollution that
interferes with the content. Good candidates for dark themes are photo and
video editors that make the actual content get all the attention and minimize
the distraction of the chrome.

<!-- trait SettingsExt::fn get_property_gtk_decoration_layout -->
This setting determines which buttons should be put in the
titlebar of client-side decorated windows, and whether they
should be placed at the left of right.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close, icon (the window icon) and menu (a menu button
for the fallback app menu).

For example, "menu:minimize,maximize,close" specifies a menu
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.

Note that buttons will only be shown when they are meaningful.
E.g. a menu button only appears when the desktop shell does not
show the app menu, and a close button only appears on a window
that can be closed.

Also note that the setting can be overridden with the
`HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property.

<!-- struct ShortcutsWindow -->
A `ShortcutsWindow` shows brief information about the keyboard shortcuts
and gestures of an application. The shortcuts can be grouped, and you can
have multiple sections in this window, corresponding to the major modes of
your application.

Additionally, the shortcuts can be filtered by the current view, to avoid
showing information that is not relevant in the current application context.

The recommended way to construct a `ShortcutsWindow` is with `Builder`,
by populating a `ShortcutsWindow` with one or more `ShortcutsSection`
objects, which contain ``GtkShortcutsGroups`` that in turn contain objects of
class `ShortcutsShortcut`.

# A simple example:

![](gedit-shortcuts.png)

This example has as single section. As you can see, the shortcut groups
are arranged in columns, and spread across several pages if there are too
many to find on a single page.

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-gedit.ui).

# An example with multiple views:

![](clocks-shortcuts.png)

This example shows a `ShortcutsWindow` that has been configured to show only
the shortcuts relevant to the "stopwatch" view.

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-clocks.ui).

# An example with multiple sections:

![](builder-shortcuts.png)

This example shows a `ShortcutsWindow` with two sections, "Editor Shortcuts"
and "Terminal Shortcuts".

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-builder.ui).

<!-- struct SizeGroup -->
`SizeGroup` provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets
together so they all request the same amount of space. This is
typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same
size, but you can’t use a `Grid` widget.

In detail, the size requested for each widget in a `SizeGroup` is
the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
of the size group (see `SizeGroupExt::set_mode`) determines whether
this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.

Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
a `SizeGroup` to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
such a way that they get the size they request and not more. For
example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
include the `GTK_FILL` flag.

`SizeGroup` objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
so once you have added all widgets to a `SizeGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the size group with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. If the
widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
freed.

Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK+ will compute the
horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
of type `SizeGroupMode::Horizontal` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`, and the
vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
`SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`.

Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
trade height for width in mode `SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`:
the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
width for height widgets.

Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum width
by way of `Label:width-chars` for instance. Widgets with static sizes as well
as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no such considerations.

# `SizeGroup` as `Buildable`

Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `SizeGroup`:

```text
<object class="GtkSizeGroup">
  <property name="mode">GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL</property>
  <widgets>
    <widget name="radio1"/>
    <widget name="radio2"/>
  </widgets>
</object>
```

<!-- struct Snapshot -->
`Snapshot` is an auxiliary object that assists in creating `GskRenderNodes`
in the `Widget::snapshot` vfunc. It functions in a similar way to
a cairo context, and maintains a stack of render nodes and their associated
transformations.

The node at the top of the stack is the the one that gtk_snapshot_append_…
functions operate on. Use the gtk_snapshot_push_… functions and `Snapshot::pop`
to change the current node.

The typical way to obtain a `Snapshot` object is as an argument to
the `Widget::snapshot` vfunc. If you need to create your own `Snapshot`,
use `Snapshot::new`.

`SortListModel` is a list model that takes a list model and
sorts its elements according to a compare function.

`SortListModel` is a generic model and because of that it
cannot take advantage of any external knowledge when sorting.
If you run into performance issues with `SortListModel`, it
is strongly recommended that you write your own sorting list
model.

<!-- struct SpinButton -->
A `SpinButton` is an ideal way to allow the user to set the value of
some attribute. Rather than having to directly type a number into a
`Entry`, `SpinButton` allows the user to click on one of two arrows
to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be
typed in, with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a
given range.

The main properties of a `SpinButton` are through an adjustment.
See the `Adjustment` section for more details about an adjustment's
properties. Note that `SpinButton` will by default make its entry
large enough to accomodate the lower and upper bounds of the adjustment,
which can lead to surprising results. Best practice is to set both
the `Entry:width-chars` and `Entry:max-width-chars` poperties
to the desired number of characters to display in the entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain

```

`GtkSpinButtons` main CSS node has the name spinbutton. It creates subnodes
for the entry and the two buttons, with these names. The button nodes have
the style classes .up and .down. The `Text` subnodes (if present) are put
below the text node. The orientation of the spin button is reflected in
the .vertical or .horizontal style class on the main node.

## Using a `SpinButton` to get an integer

<!-- trait SpinButtonExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
The ::value-changed signal is emitted when the value represented by
`spinbutton` changes. Also see the `SpinButton::output` signal.
<!-- trait SpinButtonExt::fn connect_wrapped -->
The ::wrapped signal is emitted right after the spinbutton wraps
from its maximum to minimum value or vice-versa.
<!-- enum SpinButtonUpdatePolicy -->

<!-- struct Spinner -->
A `Spinner` widget displays an icon-size spinning animation.
It is often used as an alternative to a `ProgressBar` for
displaying indefinite activity, instead of actual progress.

To start the animation, use `SpinnerExt::start`, to stop it
use `SpinnerExt::stop`.

# CSS nodes

`Spinner` has a single CSS node with the name spinner. When the animation is
active, the :checked pseudoclass is added to this node.

# Returns

a new `Spinner`
<!-- trait SpinnerExt::fn start -->
Starts the animation of the spinner.
<!-- trait SpinnerExt::fn stop -->
Stops the animation of the spinner.
<!-- struct Stack -->
The `Stack` widget is a container which only shows
one of its children at a time. In contrast to `Notebook`,
`Stack` does not provide a means for users to change the
visible child. Instead, the `StackSwitcher` widget can be
used with `Stack` to provide this functionality.

Transitions between pages can be animated as slides or
fades. This can be controlled with `StackExt::set_transition_type`.
These animations respect the `Settings:gtk-enable-animations`
setting.

`Stack` maintains a `StackPage` object for each added
child, which holds additional per-child properties. You
obtain the `StackPage` for a child with `StackExt::get_page`.

# `Stack` as `Buildable`

To set child-specific properties in a .ui file, create `StackPage`
objects explictly, and set the child widget as a property on it:

```text
  <object class="GtkStack" id="stack">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkStackPage">
        <property name="name">page1</property>
        <property name="title">In the beginning…</property>
        <property name="child">
          <object class="GtkLabel">
            <property name="label">It was dark</property>
          </object>

<!-- trait StackExt::fn get_pages -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` that contains the pages of the stack,
and can be used to keep and up-to-date view. The model also
implements `SelectionModel` and can be used to track and
modify the visible page..

# Returns

a `SelectionModel` for the stack's children

may change width when a different child becomes visible.
## `hhomogeneous`
`true` to make `self` horizontally homogeneous
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_homogeneous -->
Sets the `Stack` to be homogeneous or not. If it
is homogeneous, the `Stack` will request the same
size for all its children. If it isn't, the stack
may change size when a different child becomes visible.

Homogeneity can be controlled separately
for horizontal and vertical size, with the
`Stack:hhomogeneous` and `Stack:vhomogeneous`.
## `homogeneous`
`true` to make `self` homogeneous
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_interpolate_size -->
Sets whether or not `self` will interpolate its size when
changing the visible child. If the `Stack:interpolate-size`
property is set to `true`, `self` will interpolate its size between
the current one and the one it'll take after changing the
visible child, according to the set transition duration.
## `interpolate_size`
the new value
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_transition_duration -->
Sets the duration that transitions between pages in `self`
will take.
## `duration`
the new duration, in milliseconds
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_transition_type -->
Sets the type of animation that will be used for
transitions between pages in `self`. Available
types include various kinds of fades and slides.

The transition type can be changed without problems
at runtime, so it is possible to change the animation
based on the page that is about to become current.
## `transition`
the new transition type
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_vhomogeneous -->
Sets the `Stack` to be vertically homogeneous or not.
If it is homogeneous, the `Stack` will request the same
height for all its children. If it isn't, the stack
may change height when a different child becomes visible.
## `vhomogeneous`
`true` to make `self` vertically homogeneous
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_visible_child -->
Makes `child` the visible child of `self`.

If `child` is different from the currently
visible child, the transition between the
two will be animated with the current
transition type of `self`.

Note that the `child` widget has to be visible itself
(see `WidgetExt::show`) in order to become the visible
child of `self`.
## `child`
a child of `self`
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_visible_child_full -->
Makes the child with the given name visible.

Note that the child widget has to be visible itself
(see `WidgetExt::show`) in order to become the visible
child of `self`.

the transition type to use
<!-- trait StackExt::fn set_visible_child_name -->
Makes the child with the given name visible.

If `child` is different from the currently
visible child, the transition between the
two will be animated with the current
transition type of `self`.

Note that the child widget has to be visible itself
(see `WidgetExt::show`) in order to become the visible
child of `self`.
## `name`
the name of the child to make visible
<!-- trait StackExt::fn get_property_hhomogeneous -->

<!-- impl StackPage::fn get_child -->
Returns the stack child to which `self` belongs.

# Returns

the child to which `self` belongs
<!-- struct StackSidebar -->
A `StackSidebar` enables you to quickly and easily provide a
consistent "sidebar" object for your user interface.

In order to use a `StackSidebar`, you simply use a `Stack` to
organize your UI flow, and add the sidebar to your sidebar area. You
can use `StackSidebarExt::set_stack` to connect the `StackSidebar`
to the `Stack`.

# CSS nodes

`StackSidebar` has a single CSS node with name stacksidebar and
style class .sidebar.

When circumstances require it, `StackSidebar` adds the
.needs-attention style class to the widgets representing the stack
pages.

# Implements

[`StackSidebarExt`](trait.StackSidebarExt.html), [`BinExt`](trait.BinExt.html), [`ContainerExt`](trait.ContainerExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait StackSidebarExt -->
Trait containing all `StackSidebar` methods.

# Implementors

[`StackSidebar`](struct.StackSidebar.html)
<!-- impl StackSidebar::fn new -->
Creates a new sidebar.

# Returns

the new `StackSidebar`
<!-- trait StackSidebarExt::fn get_stack -->
Retrieves the stack.
See `StackSidebarExt::set_stack`.

# Returns

the associated `Stack` or
 `None` if none has been set explicitly
<!-- trait StackSidebarExt::fn set_stack -->
Set the `Stack` associated with this `StackSidebar`.

The sidebar widget will automatically update according to the order
(packing) and items within the given `Stack`.
## `stack`
a `Stack`
<!-- struct StackSwitcher -->
The `StackSwitcher` widget acts as a controller for a
`Stack`; it shows a row of buttons to switch between
the various pages of the associated stack widget.

All the content for the buttons comes from the child properties
of the `Stack`; the button visibility in a `StackSwitcher`
widget is controlled by the visibility of the child in the
`Stack`.

It is possible to associate multiple `StackSwitcher` widgets
with the same `Stack` widget.

The `StackSwitcher` widget was added in 3.10.

# CSS nodes

`StackSwitcher` has a single CSS node named stackswitcher and
style class .stack-switcher.

When circumstances require it, `StackSwitcher` adds the
.needs-attention style class to the widgets representing the
stack pages.

<!-- struct Statusbar -->
A `Statusbar` is usually placed along the bottom of an application's
main `Window`. It may provide a regular commentary of the application's
status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be
used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
is complete in an FTP client, for example).

Status bars in GTK+ maintain a stack of messages. The message at
the top of the each bar’s stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

Any messages added to a statusbar’s stack must specify a
context id that is used to uniquely identify
the source of a message. This context id can be generated by
`StatusbarExt::get_context_id`, given a message and the statusbar that
it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a stack, and when
choosing which message to display, the stack structure is adhered to,
regardless of the context identifier of a message.

One could say that a statusbar maintains one stack of messages for
display purposes, but allows multiple message producers to maintain
sub-stacks of the messages they produced (via context ids).

Status bars are created using `Statusbar::new`.

Messages are added to the bar’s stack with `StatusbarExt::push`.

The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
`StatusbarExt::pop`. A message can be removed from anywhere in the
stack if its message id was recorded at the time it was added. This
is done using `StatusbarExt::remove`.

# CSS node

`Statusbar` has a single CSS node with name statusbar.

<!-- struct StyleContext -->
`StyleContext` is an object that stores styling information affecting
a widget defined by `WidgetPath`.

In order to construct the final style information, `StyleContext`
queries information from all attached ``GtkStyleProviders``. Style providers
can be either attached explicitly to the context through
`StyleContextExt::add_provider`, or to the display through
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`. The resulting style is a
combination of all providers’ information in priority order.

For GTK+ widgets, any `StyleContext` returned by
`WidgetExt::get_style_context` will already have a `WidgetPath`, a
`gdk::Display` and RTL/LTR information set. The style context will also be
updated automatically if any of these settings change on the widget.

If you are using the theming layer standalone, you will need to set a
widget path and a display yourself to the created style context through
`StyleContextExt::set_path` and possibly `StyleContextExt::set_display`.
See the “Foreign drawing“ example in gtk4-demo.

# Style Classes # {`gtkstylecontext`-classes}

Widgets can add style classes to their context, which can be used to associate
different styles by class. The documentation for individual widgets lists
which style classes it uses itself, and which style classes may be added by
applications to affect their appearance.

GTK+ defines macros for a number of style classes.

# Custom styling in UI libraries and applications

If you are developing a library with custom ``GtkWidgets`` that
render differently than standard components, you may need to add a
`StyleProvider` yourself with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK`
priority, either a `CssProvider` or a custom object implementing the
`StyleProvider` interface. This way themes may still attempt
to style your UI elements in a different way if needed so.

If you are using custom styling on an applications, you probably want then
to make your style information prevail to the theme’s, so you must use
a `StyleProvider` with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`
priority, keep in mind that the user settings in
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` will
still take precedence over your changes, as it uses the
`GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER` priority.

# Implements

[`StyleContextExt`](trait.StyleContextExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait StyleContextExt -->
Trait containing all `StyleContext` methods.

# Implementors

[`StyleContext`](struct.StyleContext.html)
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn new -->
Creates a standalone `StyleContext`, this style context
won’t be attached to any widget, so you may want
to call `StyleContextExt::set_path` yourself.

This function is only useful when using the theming layer
separated from GTK+, if you are using `StyleContext` to
theme ``GtkWidgets``, use `WidgetExt::get_style_context`
in order to get a style context ready to theme the widget.

# Returns

A newly created `StyleContext`.
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_provider_for_display -->
Adds a global style provider to `display`, which will be used
in style construction for all ``GtkStyleContexts`` under `display`.

GTK+ uses this to make styling information from `Settings`
available.

Note: If both priorities are the same, A `StyleProvider`
added through `StyleContextExt::add_provider` takes precedence
over another added through this function.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn remove_provider_for_display -->
Removes `provider` from the global style providers list in `display`.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn reset_widgets -->
This function recomputes the styles for all widgets under a particular
`gdk::Display`. This is useful when some global parameter has changed that
affects the appearance of all widgets, because when a widget gets a new
style, it will both redraw and recompute any cached information about
its appearance. As an example, it is used when the color scheme changes
in the related `Settings` object.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn add_class -->
Adds a style class to `self`, so posterior calls to
`StyleContextExt::get` or any of the gtk_render_*()
functions will make use of this new class for styling.

In the CSS file format, a `Entry` defining a “search”
class, would be matched by:


```CSS
entry.search { ... }
```

While any widget defining a “search” class would be
matched by:

```CSS
.search { ... }
```
## `class_name`
class name to use in styling
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn add_provider -->
Adds a style provider to `self`, to be used in style construction.
Note that a style provider added by this function only affects
the style of the widget to which `self` belongs. If you want
to affect the style of all widgets, use
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

Note: If both priorities are the same, a `StyleProvider`
added through this function takes precedence over another added
through `StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get -->
Retrieves several style property values from `self` for a
given state.

See `StyleContextExt::get_property` for details.

As with `gobject::ObjectExt::get`, a copy is made of the property contents for
pointer-valued properties, and the caller is responsible for freeing the
memory in the appropriate manner for the type. For example, by calling
`g_free` or `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. Non-pointer-valued properties, such as
integers, are returned by value and do not need to be freed.
## `first_property_name`
Name of the first property
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_border -->
Gets the border for a given state as a `Border`.

See `StyleContextExt::get_property` and
`GTK_STYLE_PROPERTY_BORDER_WIDTH` for details.
## `border`
return value for the border settings
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_color -->
Gets the foreground color for a given state.

See `StyleContextExt::get_property` and
`GTK_STYLE_PROPERTY_COLOR` for details.
## `color`
return value for the foreground color
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_display -->
Returns the `gdk::Display` to which `self` is attached.

# Returns

a `gdk::Display`.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_margin -->
Gets the margin for a given state as a `Border`.
See `gtk_style_property_get` and `GTK_STYLE_PROPERTY_MARGIN`
for details.
## `margin`
return value for the margin settings
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_padding -->
Gets the padding for a given state as a `Border`.
See `StyleContextExt::get` and `GTK_STYLE_PROPERTY_PADDING`
for details.
## `padding`
return value for the padding settings
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_parent -->
Gets the parent context set via `StyleContextExt::set_parent`.
See that function for details.

# Returns

the parent context or `None`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_path -->
Returns the widget path used for style matching.

# Returns

A `WidgetPath`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_property -->
Gets a style property from `self` for the current state.

Note that not all CSS properties that are supported by GTK+ can be
retrieved in this way, since they may not be representable as `gobject::Value`.
GTK+ defines macros for a number of properties that can be used
with this function.

When `value` is no longer needed, `gobject::Value::unset` must be called
to free any allocated memory.
## `property`
style property name
## `value`
return location for the style property value
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_scale -->
Returns the scale used for assets.

# Returns

the scale
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_section -->
Queries the location in the CSS where `property` was defined for the
current `self`. Note that the state to be queried is taken from
`StyleContextExt::get_state`.

If the location is not available, `None` will be returned. The
location might not be available for various reasons, such as the
property being overridden, `property` not naming a supported CSS
property or tracking of definitions being disabled for performance
reasons.

Shorthand CSS properties cannot be queried for a location and will
always return `None`.
## `property`
style property name

# Returns

`None` or the section where a value
for `property` was defined
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_state -->
Returns the state used for style matching.

This method should only be used to retrieve the `StateFlags`
to pass to `StyleContext` methods, like `StyleContextExt::get_padding`.
If you need to retrieve the current state of a `Widget`, use
`WidgetExt::get_state_flags`.

# Returns

the state flags
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_valist -->
Retrieves several style property values from `self` for a given state.

See `StyleContextExt::get_property` for details.

As with `gobject::ObjectExt::get`, a copy is made of the property contents for
pointer-valued properties, and the caller is responsible for freeing the
memory in the appropriate manner for the type. For example, by calling
`g_free` or `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. Non-pointer-valued properties, such as
integers, are returned by value and do not need to be freed.
## `first_property_name`
Name of the first property
## `args`
va_list of property name/return location pairs, followed by `None`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn has_class -->
Returns `true` if `self` currently has defined the
given class name.
## `class_name`
a class name

# Returns

`true` if `self` has `class_name` defined
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn list_classes -->
Returns the list of classes currently defined in `self`.

# Returns

a `glib::List` of
 strings with the currently defined classes. The contents
 of the list are owned by GTK+, but you must free the list
 itself with `glib::List::free` when you are done with it.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn lookup_color -->
Looks up and resolves a color name in the `self` color map.
## `color_name`
color name to lookup
## `color`
Return location for the looked up color

# Returns

`true` if `color_name` was found and resolved, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn remove_class -->
Removes `class_name` from `self`.
## `class_name`
class name to remove
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn remove_provider -->
Removes `provider` from the style providers list in `self`.
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn restore -->
Restores `self` state to a previous stage.
See `StyleContextExt::save`.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn save -->
Saves the `self` state, so temporary modifications done through
`StyleContextExt::add_class`, `StyleContextExt::remove_class`,
`StyleContextExt::set_state`, etc. can quickly be reverted
in one go through `StyleContextExt::restore`.

The matching call to `StyleContextExt::restore` must be done
before GTK returns to the main loop.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_display -->
Attaches `self` to the given display.

The display is used to add style information from “global” style
providers, such as the display's `Settings` instance.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`WidgetExt::get_style_context`, you do not need to
call this yourself.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_parent -->
Sets the parent style context for `self`. The parent style
context is used to implement
[inheritance](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/`inheritance`)
of properties.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`WidgetExt::get_style_context`, the parent will be set for you.
## `parent`
the new parent or `None`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_path -->
Sets the `WidgetPath` used for style matching. As a
consequence, the style will be regenerated to match
the new given path.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`WidgetExt::get_style_context`, you do not need to call
this yourself.
## `path`
a `WidgetPath`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_scale -->
Sets the scale to use when getting image assets for the style.
## `scale`
scale
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the state to be used for style matching.
## `flags`
state to represent
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn to_string -->
Converts the style context into a string representation.

The string representation always includes information about
the name, state, id, visibility and style classes of the CSS
node that is backing `self`. Depending on the flags, more
information may be included.

This function is intended for testing and debugging of the
CSS implementation in GTK+. There are no guarantees about
the format of the returned string, it may change.
## `flags`
Flags that determine what to print

# Returns

a newly allocated string representing `self`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn connect_changed -->
The ::changed signal is emitted when there is a change in the
`StyleContext`.

For a `StyleContext` returned by `WidgetExt::get_style_context`, the
`Widget::style-updated` signal/vfunc might be more convenient to use.

This signal is useful when using the theming layer standalone.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_property_parent -->
Sets or gets the style context’s parent. See `StyleContextExt::set_parent`
for details.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_property_parent -->
Sets or gets the style context’s parent. See `StyleContextExt::set_parent`
for details.
<!-- struct StyleProvider -->
`StyleProvider` is an interface used to provide style information to a `StyleContext`.
See `StyleContextExt::add_provider` and `StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

<!-- struct Switch -->
`Switch` is a widget that has two states: on or off. The user can control
which state should be active by clicking the empty area, or by dragging the
handle.

`Switch` can also handle situations where the underlying state changes with
a delay. See `Switch::state-set` for details.

# CSS nodes


```plain
switch
├── label
├── label
╰── slider
```

`Switch` has four css nodes, the main node with the name switch and subnodes
for the slider and the on and off labels. Neither of them is using any style classes.

# Implements

[`SwitchExt`](trait.SwitchExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait SwitchExt -->
Trait containing all `Switch` methods.

# Implementors

[`Switch`](struct.Switch.html)
<!-- impl Switch::fn new -->
Creates a new `Switch` widget.

# Returns

the newly created `Switch` instance
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn get_active -->
Gets whether the `Switch` is in its “on” or “off” state.

# Returns

`true` if the `Switch` is active, and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn get_state -->
Gets the underlying state of the `Switch`.

# Returns

the underlying state
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn set_active -->
Changes the state of `self` to the desired one.
## `is_active`
`true` if `self` should be active, and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the underlying state of the `Switch`.

Normally, this is the same as `Switch:active`, unless the switch
is set up for delayed state changes. This function is typically
called from a `Switch::state-set` signal handler.

See `Switch::state-set` for details.
## `state`
the new state
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal on `Switch` is an action signal and
emitting it causes the switch to animate.
Applications should never connect to this signal, but use the
notify::active signal.
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn connect_state_set -->
The ::state-set signal on `Switch` is emitted to change the underlying
state. It is emitted when the user changes the switch position. The
default handler keeps the state in sync with the `Switch:active`
property.

To implement delayed state change, applications can connect to this signal,
initiate the change of the underlying state, and call `SwitchExt::set_state`
when the underlying state change is complete. The signal handler should
return `true` to prevent the default handler from running.

Visually, the underlying state is represented by the trough color of
the switch, while the `Switch:active` property is represented by the
position of the switch.
## `state`
the new state of the switch

# Returns

`true` to stop the signal emission
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn get_property_active -->
Whether the `Switch` widget is in its on or off state.
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn set_property_active -->
Whether the `Switch` widget is in its on or off state.
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn get_property_state -->
The backend state that is controlled by the switch.
See `Switch::state-set` for details.
<!-- trait SwitchExt::fn set_property_state -->
The backend state that is controlled by the switch.
See `Switch::state-set` for details.
<!-- struct Text -->
The `Text` widget is a single line text entry widget.

A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the
entered text is longer than the allocation of the widget, the widget
will scroll so that the cursor position is visible.

When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
it can be put into “password mode” using `Text::set_visibility`.
In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
in the current font, but it can be changed with `Text::set_invisible_char`.

If you are looking to add icons or progress display in an entry, look
at `Entry`. There other alternatives for more specialized use cases,
such as `SearchEntry`.

If you need multi-line editable text, look at `TextView`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
text[.read-only]
├── placeholder
├── undershoot.left
├── undershoot.right
├── [selection]
├── [block-cursor]
╰── [window.popup]
```

`Text` has a main node with the name text. Depending on the properties
of the widget, the .read-only style class may appear.

When the entry has a selection, it adds a subnode with the name selection.

When the entry is in overwrite mode, it adds a subnode with the name block-cursor
that determines how the block cursor is drawn.

The CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode below text as well.

The undershoot nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content
is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the .left and .right style classes
added depending on where the indication is drawn.

When touch is used and touch selection handles are shown, they are using
CSS nodes with name cursor-handle. They get the .top or .bottom style class
depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If there is
just a single handle for the text cursor, it gets the style class .insertion-cursor.

the current invisible char, or 0, if the self does not
 show invisible text at all.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_max_length -->
Retrieves the maximum allowed length of the text in
`self`. See `Text::set_max_length`.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and
calling `EntryBuffer::get_max_length` on it.

# Returns

the maximum allowed number of characters
 in `Text`, or 0 if there is no maximum.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_overwrite_mode -->
Gets the value set by `Text::set_overwrite_mode`.

# Returns

whether the text is overwritten when typing.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_placeholder_text -->
Retrieves the text that will be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused

<!-- impl Text::fn get_visibility -->
Retrieves whether the text in `self` is visible.
See `Text::set_visibility`.

# Returns

`true` if the text is currently visible
<!-- impl Text::fn grab_focus_without_selecting -->
Causes `self` to have keyboard focus.

It behaves like `WidgetExt::grab_focus`,
except that it doesn't select the contents of the self.
You only want to call this on some special entries
which the user usually doesn't want to replace all text in,
such as search-as-you-type entries.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_activates_default -->
If `activates` is `true`, pressing Enter in the `self` will activate the default
widget for the window containing the self. This usually means that
the dialog box containing the self will be closed, since the default
widget is usually one of the dialog buttons.
## `activates`
`true` to activate window’s default widget on Enter keypress
<!-- impl Text::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
self text.
## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_buffer -->
Set the `EntryBuffer` object which holds the text for
this widget.
## `buffer`
a `EntryBuffer`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_input_hints -->
Sets the `Text:input-hints` property, which
allows input methods to fine-tune their behaviour.
## `hints`
the hints
<!-- impl Text::fn set_input_purpose -->
Sets the `Text:input-purpose` property which
can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.
## `purpose`
the purpose
<!-- impl Text::fn set_invisible_char -->
Sets the character to use in place of the actual text when
`Text::set_visibility` has been called to set text visibility
to `false`. i.e. this is the character used in “password mode” to
show the user how many characters have been typed.

By default, GTK picks the best invisible char available in the
current font. If you set the invisible char to 0, then the user
will get no feedback at all; there will be no text on the screen
as they type.
## `ch`
a Unicode character
<!-- impl Text::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the widget.

If the current contents are longer than the given length, then
they will be truncated to fit.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and
calling `EntryBuffer::set_max_length` on it.
]|
## `length`
the maximum length of the self, or 0 for no maximum.
 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_overwrite_mode -->
Sets whether the text is overwritten when typing in the `Text`.
## `overwrite`
new value
<!-- impl Text::fn set_placeholder_text -->
Sets text to be displayed in `self` when it is empty.

This can be used to give a visual hint of the expected
contents of the self.
## `text`
a string to be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused, or `None`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_tabs -->
Sets a `pango::TabArray`; the tabstops in the array are applied to the self
text.
## `tabs`
a `pango::TabArray`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_visibility -->
Sets whether the contents of the self are visible or not.
When visibility is set to `false`, characters are displayed
as the invisible char, and will also appear that way when
the text in the self widget is copied to the clipboard.

By default, GTK picks the best invisible character available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`Text::set_invisible_char`.

Note that you probably want to set `Text:input-purpose`
to `InputPurpose::Password` or `InputPurpose::Pin` to
inform input methods about the purpose of this self,
in addition to setting visibility to `false`.
## `visible`
`true` if the contents of the self are displayed
 as plaintext
<!-- impl Text::fn unset_invisible_char -->
Unsets the invisible char previously set with
`Text::set_invisible_char`. So that the
default invisible char is used again.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal is emitted when the user hits
the Enter key.

The default bindings for this signal are all forms of the Enter key.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_backspace -->
The ::backspace signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

The default bindings for this signal are
Backspace and Shift-Backspace.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_copy_clipboard -->
The ::copy-clipboard signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to copy the selection to the clipboard.

The default bindings for this signal are
Ctrl-c and Ctrl-Insert.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_cut_clipboard -->
The ::cut-clipboard signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to cut the selection to the clipboard.

The default bindings for this signal are
Ctrl-x and Shift-Delete.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_delete_from_cursor -->
The ::delete-from-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a text deletion.

If the `type_` is `DeleteType::Chars`, GTK deletes the selection
if there is one, otherwise it deletes the requested number
of characters.

The default bindings for this signal are
Delete for deleting a character and Ctrl-Delete for
deleting a word.
## `type_`
the granularity of the deletion, as a `DeleteType`
## `count`
the number of `type_` units to delete
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_insert_at_cursor -->
The ::insert-at-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates the insertion of a
fixed string at the cursor.

This signal has no default bindings.
## `string`
the string to insert
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_insert_emoji -->
The ::insert-emoji signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to present the Emoji chooser for the `self_`.

The default bindings for this signal are Ctrl-. and Ctrl-;
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `self_`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifer does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual characters/lines
- Ctrl-arrow key combinations move by words/paragraphs
- Home/End keys move to the ends of the buffer
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a `MovementStep`
## `count`
the number of `step` units to move
## `extend`
`true` if the move should extend the selection
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_paste_clipboard -->
The ::paste-clipboard signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to paste the contents of the clipboard
into the text view.

The default bindings for this signal are
Ctrl-v and Shift-Insert.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_populate_popup -->
The ::populate-popup signal gets emitted before showing the
context menu of the self.

If you need to add items to the context menu, connect
to this signal and append your items to the `widget`, which
will be a `Menu` in this case.

If `Text:populate-all` is `true`, this signal will
also be emitted to populate touch popups. In this case,
`widget` will be a different container, e.g. a `Toolbar`.
The signal handler should not make assumptions about the
type of `widget`.
## `widget`
the container that is being populated
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_preedit_changed -->
If an input method is used, the typed text will not immediately
be committed to the buffer. So if you are interested in the text,
connect to this signal.
## `preedit`
the current preedit string
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_toggle_overwrite -->
The ::toggle-overwrite signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted to toggle the overwrite mode of the self.

The default bindings for this signal is Insert.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_attributes -->
A list of Pango attributes to apply to the text of the self.

This is mainly useful to change the size or weight of the text.

The `pango::Attribute`'s `start_index` and `end_index` must refer to the
`EntryBuffer` text, i.e. without the preedit string.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_attributes -->
A list of Pango attributes to apply to the text of the self.

This is mainly useful to change the size or weight of the text.

The `pango::Attribute`'s `start_index` and `end_index` must refer to the
`EntryBuffer` text, i.e. without the preedit string.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_im_module -->
Which IM (input method) module should be used for this self.
See `IMContext`.

Setting this to a non-`None` value overrides the
system-wide IM module setting. See the `Settings`
`Settings:gtk-im-module` property.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_im_module -->
Which IM (input method) module should be used for this self.
See `IMContext`.

Setting this to a non-`None` value overrides the
system-wide IM module setting. See the `Settings`
`Settings:gtk-im-module` property.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_input_hints -->
Additional hints (beyond `Text:input-purpose`) that
allow input methods to fine-tune their behaviour.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_input_hints -->
Additional hints (beyond `Text:input-purpose`) that
allow input methods to fine-tune their behaviour.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_input_purpose -->
The purpose of this text field.

This property can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.

Note that setting the purpose to `InputPurpose::Password` or
`InputPurpose::Pin` is independent from setting
`Text:visibility`.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_input_purpose -->
The purpose of this text field.

This property can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.

Note that setting the purpose to `InputPurpose::Password` or
`InputPurpose::Pin` is independent from setting
`Text:visibility`.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_invisible_char_set -->
Whether the invisible char has been set for the `Text`.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_invisible_char_set -->
Whether the invisible char has been set for the `Text`.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_overwrite_mode -->
If text is overwritten when typing in the `Text`.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_overwrite_mode -->
If text is overwritten when typing in the `Text`.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_placeholder_text -->
The text that will be displayed in the `Text` when it is empty
and unfocused.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_placeholder_text -->
The text that will be displayed in the `Text` when it is empty
and unfocused.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_populate_all -->
If :populate-all is `true`, the `Text::populate-popup`
signal is also emitted for touch popups.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_populate_all -->
If :populate-all is `true`, the `Text::populate-popup`
signal is also emitted for touch popups.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_property_truncate_multiline -->
When `true`, pasted multi-line text is truncated to the first line.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_property_truncate_multiline -->
When `true`, pasted multi-line text is truncated to the first line.

<!-- trait TextBufferExt -->
Trait containing all `TextBuffer` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextBuffer`](struct.TextBuffer.html)
<!-- impl TextBuffer::fn new -->
Creates a new text buffer.
## `table`
a tag table, or `None` to create a new one

# Returns

a new text buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn add_mark -->
Adds the mark at position `where_`. The mark must not be added to
another buffer, and if its name is not `None` then there must not
be another mark in the buffer with the same name.

Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal as notification of the mark's
initial placement.
## `mark`
the mark to add
## `where_`
location to place mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn add_selection_clipboard -->
Adds `clipboard` to the list of clipboards in which the selection
contents of `self` are available. In most cases, `clipboard` will be
the `gdk::Clipboard` returned by `gdk_widget_get_primary_clipboard`
for a view of `self`.
## `clipboard`
a `gdk::Clipboard`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn apply_tag -->
Emits the “apply-tag” signal on `self`. The default
handler for the signal applies `tag` to the given range.
`start` and `end` do not have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn apply_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTableExt::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBufferExt::apply_tag`.
## `name`
name of a named `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn backspace -->
Performs the appropriate action as if the user hit the delete
key with the cursor at the position specified by `iter`. In the
normal case a single character will be deleted, but when
combining accents are involved, more than one character can
be deleted, and when precomposed character and accent combinations
are involved, less than one character will be deleted.

Because the buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become
invalid after calling this function; however, the `iter` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

`true` if the buffer was modified
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn begin_user_action -->
Called to indicate that the buffer operations between here and a
call to `TextBufferExt::end_user_action` are part of a single
user-visible operation. The operations between
`TextBufferExt::begin_user_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_user_action` can then be grouped when creating
an undo stack. `TextBuffer` maintains a count of calls to
`TextBufferExt::begin_user_action` that have not been closed with
a call to `TextBufferExt::end_user_action`, and emits the
“begin-user-action” and “end-user-action” signals only for the
outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions
from other user actions.

The “interactive” buffer mutation functions, such as
`TextBufferExt::insert_interactive`, automatically call begin/end
user action around the buffer operations they perform, so there's
no need to add extra calls if you user action consists solely of a
single call to one of those functions.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn copy_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` object to copy to
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_child_anchor -->
This is a convenience function which simply creates a child anchor
with `TextChildAnchor::new` and inserts it into the buffer
with `TextBufferExt::insert_child_anchor`. The new anchor is
owned by the buffer; no reference count is returned to
the caller of `TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor`.
## `iter`
location in the buffer

# Returns

the created child anchor
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_mark -->
Creates a mark at position `where_`. If `mark_name` is `None`, the mark
is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name using
`TextBufferExt::get_mark`. If a mark has left gravity, and text is
inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark will be moved to
the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity
(`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the right of
newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark
with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).

The caller of this function does not own a
reference to the returned `TextMark`, so you can ignore the
return value if you like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go
away when the buffer does.

Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal as notification of the mark's
initial placement.
## `mark_name`
name for mark, or `None`
## `where_`
location to place mark
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark has left gravity

# Returns

the new `TextMark` object
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_tag -->
Creates a tag and adds it to the tag table for `self`.
Equivalent to calling `TextTag::new` and then adding the
tag to the buffer’s tag table. The returned tag is owned by
the buffer’s tag table, so the ref count will be equal to one.

If `tag_name` is `None`, the tag is anonymous.

If `tag_name` is non-`None`, a tag called `tag_name` must not already
exist in the tag table for this buffer.

The `first_property_name` argument and subsequent arguments are a list
of properties to set on the tag, as with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`.
## `tag_name`
name of the new tag, or `None`
## `first_property_name`
name of first property to set, or `None`

# Returns

a new tag
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn cut_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard, then deletes
said text if it’s editable.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` object to cut to
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete -->
Deletes text between `start` and `end`. The order of `start` and `end`
is not actually relevant; `TextBufferExt::delete` will reorder
them. This function actually emits the “delete-range” signal, and
the default handler of that signal deletes the text. Because the
buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid after
calling this function; however, the `start` and `end` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `start`
a position in `self`
## `end`
another position in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_interactive -->
Deletes all editable text in the given range.
Calls `TextBufferExt::delete` for each editable sub-range of
[`start`,`end`). `start` and `end` are revalidated to point to
the location of the last deleted range, or left untouched if
no text was deleted.
## `start_iter`
start of range to delete
## `end_iter`
end of range
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether some text was actually deleted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_mark -->
Deletes `mark`, so that it’s no longer located anywhere in the
buffer. Removes the reference the buffer holds to the mark, so if
you haven’t called `gobject::ObjectExt::ref` on the mark, it will be freed. Even
if the mark isn’t freed, most operations on `mark` become
invalid, until it gets added to a buffer again with
`TextBufferExt::add_mark`. Use `TextMarkExt::get_deleted` to
find out if a mark has been removed from its buffer.
The `TextBuffer::mark-deleted` signal will be emitted as notification after
the mark is deleted.
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_mark_by_name -->
Deletes the mark named `name`; the mark must exist. See
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_selection -->
Deletes the range between the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks,
that is, the currently-selected text. If `interactive` is `true`,
the editability of the selection will be considered (users can’t delete
uneditable text).
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether there was a non-empty selection to delete
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn end_user_action -->
Should be paired with a call to `TextBufferExt::begin_user_action`.
See that function for a full explanation.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_bounds -->
Retrieves the first and last iterators in the buffer, i.e. the
entire buffer lies within the range [`start`,`end`).
## `start`
iterator to initialize with first position in the buffer
## `end`
iterator to initialize with the end iterator
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_char_count -->
Gets the number of characters in the buffer; note that characters
and bytes are not the same, you can’t e.g. expect the contents of
the buffer in string form to be this many bytes long. The character
count is cached, so this function is very fast.

# Returns

number of characters in the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_end_iter -->
Initializes `iter` with the “end iterator,” one past the last valid
character in the text buffer. If dereferenced with
`TextIter::get_char`, the end iterator has a character value of 0.
The entire buffer lies in the range from the first position in
the buffer (call `TextBufferExt::get_start_iter` to get
character position 0) to the end iterator.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_has_selection -->
Indicates whether the buffer has some text currently selected.

# Returns

`true` if the there is text selected
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_insert -->
Returns the mark that represents the cursor (insertion point).
Equivalent to calling `TextBufferExt::get_mark` to get the mark
named “insert”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves less
typing.

# Returns

insertion point mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_child_anchor -->
Obtains the location of `anchor` within `self`.
## `iter`
an iterator to be initialized
## `anchor`
a child anchor that appears in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line -->
Initializes `iter` to the start of the given line. If `line_number` is greater
than the number of lines in the `self`, the end iterator is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line_index -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `byte_index` within the given line.
`byte_index` must be the start of a UTF-8 character. Note bytes, not
characters; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.

If `line_number` is greater than the number of lines
in the `self`, the end iterator is returned. And if `byte_index` is off the
end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `byte_index`
byte index from start of line
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line_offset -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `char_offset` within the given line. Note
characters, not bytes; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.

Before the 3.20 version, it was not allowed to pass an invalid location.

If `line_number` is greater than the number of lines
in the `self`, the end iterator is returned. And if `char_offset` is off the
end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of line
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_mark -->
Initializes `iter` with the current position of `mark`.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_offset -->
Initializes `iter` to a position `char_offset` chars from the start
of the entire buffer. If `char_offset` is -1 or greater than the number
of characters in the buffer, `iter` is initialized to the end iterator,
the iterator one past the last valid character in the buffer.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of buffer, counting from 0, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_line_count -->
Obtains the number of lines in the buffer. This value is cached, so
the function is very fast.

# Returns

number of lines in the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_mark -->
Returns the mark named `name` in buffer `self`, or `None` if no such
mark exists in the buffer.
## `name`
a mark name

# Returns

a `TextMark`, or `None`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_modified -->
Indicates whether the buffer has been modified since the last call
to `TextBufferExt::set_modified` set the modification flag to
`false`. Used for example to enable a “save” function in a text
editor.

# Returns

`true` if the buffer has been modified
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_selection_bound -->
Returns the mark that represents the selection bound. Equivalent
to calling `TextBufferExt::get_mark` to get the mark named
“selection_bound”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves
less typing.

The currently-selected text in `self` is the region between the
“selection_bound” and “insert” marks. If “selection_bound” and
“insert” are in the same place, then there is no current selection.
`TextBufferExt::get_selection_bounds` is another convenient function
for handling the selection, if you just want to know whether there’s a
selection and what its bounds are.

# Returns

selection bound mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Returns `true` if some text is selected; places the bounds
of the selection in `start` and `end` (if the selection has length 0,
then `start` and `end` are filled in with the same value).
`start` and `end` will be in ascending order. If `start` and `end` are
NULL, then they are not filled in, but the return value still indicates
whether text is selected.
## `start`
iterator to initialize with selection start
## `end`
iterator to initialize with selection end

# Returns

whether the selection has nonzero length
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. The returned string includes a
0xFFFC character whenever the buffer contains
embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBufferExt::get_text`. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a texture or
widget is in the buffer.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_start_iter -->
Initialized `iter` with the first position in the text buffer. This
is the same as using `TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_offset` to get
the iter at character offset 0.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_tag_table -->
Get the `TextTagTable` associated with this buffer.

# Returns

the buffer’s tag table
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_text -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. Does not include characters
representing embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do not correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBufferExt::get_slice`.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert -->
Inserts `len` bytes of `text` at position `iter`. If `len` is -1,
`text` must be nul-terminated and will be inserted in its
entirety. Emits the “insert-text” signal; insertion actually occurs
in the default handler for the signal. `iter` is invalidated when
insertion occurs (because the buffer contents change), but the
default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
inserted text.
## `iter`
a position in the buffer
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_at_cursor -->
Simply calls `TextBufferExt::insert`, using the current
cursor position as the insertion point.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text, in bytes
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_child_anchor -->
Inserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at `iter`. The
anchor will be counted as one character in character counts, and
when obtaining the buffer contents as a string, will be represented
by the Unicode “object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the
“slice” variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string
include this character for child anchors, but the “text” variants do
not. E.g. see `TextBufferExt::get_slice` and
`TextBufferExt::get_text`. Consider
`TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor` as a more convenient
alternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference to
the anchor, so you can unref it after insertion.
## `iter`
location to insert the anchor
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_interactive -->
Like `TextBufferExt::insert`, but the insertion will not occur if
`iter` is at a non-editable location in the buffer. Usually you
want to prevent insertions at ineditable locations if the insertion
results from a user action (is interactive).

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `text`
some UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_interactive_at_cursor -->
Calls `TextBufferExt::insert_interactive` at the cursor
position.

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_markup -->
Inserts the text in `markup` at position `iter`. `markup` will be inserted
in its entirety and must be nul-terminated and valid UTF-8. Emits the
`TextBuffer::insert-text` signal, possibly multiple times; insertion
actually occurs in the default handler for the signal. `iter` will point
to the end of the inserted text on return.
## `iter`
location to insert the markup
## `markup`
a nul-terminated UTF-8 string containing [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat]
## `len`
length of `markup` in bytes, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_range -->
Copies text, tags, and texture between `start` and `end` (the order
of `start` and `end` doesn’t matter) and inserts the copy at `iter`.
Used instead of simply getting/inserting text because it preserves
images and tags. If `start` and `end` are in a different buffer from
`self`, the two buffers must share the same tag table.

Implemented via emissions of the insert_text and apply_tag signals,
so expect those.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_range_interactive -->
Same as `TextBufferExt::insert_range`, but does nothing if the
insertion point isn’t editable. The `default_editable` parameter
indicates whether the text is editable at `iter` if no tags
enclosing `iter` affect editability. Typically the result of
`TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer

# Returns

whether an insertion was possible at `iter`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_texture -->
Inserts an image into the text buffer at `iter`. The image will be
counted as one character in character counts, and when obtaining
the buffer contents as a string, will be represented by the Unicode
“object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the “slice”
variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string include
this character for texture, but the “text” variants do
not. e.g. see `TextBufferExt::get_slice` and
`TextBufferExt::get_text`.
## `iter`
location to insert the texture
## `texture`
a `gdk::Texture`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_with_tags -->
Inserts `text` into `self` at `iter`, applying the list of tags to
the newly-inserted text. The last tag specified must be `None` to
terminate the list. Equivalent to calling `TextBufferExt::insert`,
then `TextBufferExt::apply_tag` on the inserted text;
`TextBufferExt::insert_with_tags` is just a convenience function.
## `iter`
an iterator in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag`
first tag to apply to `text`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_with_tags_by_name -->
Same as `TextBufferExt::insert_with_tags`, but allows you
to pass in tag names instead of tag objects.
## `iter`
position in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag_name`
name of a tag to apply to `text`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn move_mark -->
Moves `mark` to the new location `where_`. Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set`
signal as notification of the move.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `where_`
new location for `mark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn move_mark_by_name -->
Moves the mark named `name` (which must exist) to location `where_`.
See `TextBufferExt::move_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark
## `where_`
new location for mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn paste_clipboard -->
Pastes the contents of a clipboard. If `override_location` is `None`, the
pasted text will be inserted at the cursor position, or the buffer selection
will be replaced if the selection is non-empty.

Note: pasting is asynchronous, that is, we’ll ask for the paste data and
return, and at some point later after the main loop runs, the paste data will
be inserted.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` to paste from
## `override_location`
location to insert pasted text, or `None`
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn place_cursor -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them to the same place in two steps
with `TextBufferExt::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `where_`
where to put the cursor
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_all_tags -->
Removes all tags in the range between `start` and `end`. Be careful
with this function; it could remove tags added in code unrelated to
the code you’re currently writing. That is, using this function is
probably a bad idea if you have two or more unrelated code sections
that add tags.
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_selection_clipboard -->
Removes a `gdk::Clipboard` added with
`TextBufferExt::add_selection_clipboard`.
## `clipboard`
a `gdk::Clipboard` added to `self` by
 `TextBufferExt::add_selection_clipboard`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_tag -->
Emits the “remove-tag” signal. The default handler for the signal
removes all occurrences of `tag` from the given range. `start` and
`end` don’t have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTableExt::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBufferExt::remove_tag`.
## `name`
name of a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn select_range -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them in two steps
with `TextBufferExt::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `ins`
where to put the “insert” mark
## `bound`
where to put the “selection_bound” mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_modified -->
Used to keep track of whether the buffer has been modified since the
last time it was saved. Whenever the buffer is saved to disk, call
gtk_text_buffer_set_modified (`self`, FALSE). When the buffer is modified,
it will automatically toggled on the modified bit again. When the modified
bit flips, the buffer emits the `TextBuffer::modified-changed` signal.
## `setting`
modification flag setting
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_text -->
Deletes current contents of `self`, and inserts `text` instead. If
`len` is -1, `text` must be nul-terminated. `text` must be valid UTF-8.
## `text`
UTF-8 text to insert
## `len`
length of `text` in bytes
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_apply_tag -->
The ::apply-tag signal is emitted to apply a tag to a
range of text in a `TextBuffer`.
Applying actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).

See also:
`TextBufferExt::apply_tag`,
`TextBufferExt::insert_with_tags`,
`TextBufferExt::insert_range`.
## `tag`
the applied tag
## `start`
the start of the range the tag is applied to
## `end`
the end of the range the tag is applied to
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_begin_user_action -->
The ::begin-user-action signal is emitted at the beginning of a single
user-visible operation on a `TextBuffer`.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::begin_user_action`,
`TextBufferExt::insert_interactive`,
`TextBufferExt::insert_range_interactive`,
`TextBufferExt::delete_interactive`,

<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_changed -->
The ::changed signal is emitted when the content of a `TextBuffer`
has changed.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_delete_range -->
The ::delete-range signal is emitted to delete a range
from a `TextBuffer`.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).
The default signal handler revalidates the `start` and `end` iters to
both point to the location where text was deleted. Handlers
which run after the default handler (see `g_signal_connect_after`)
do not have access to the deleted text.

See also: `TextBufferExt::delete`.
## `start`
the start of the range to be deleted
## `end`
the end of the range to be deleted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_end_user_action -->

`TextBufferExt::delete_selection`,
`TextBufferExt::backspace`.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_insert_child_anchor -->
The ::insert-child-anchor signal is emitted to insert a
`TextChildAnchor` in a `TextBuffer`.
Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must
not invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).
The default signal handler revalidates it to be placed after the
inserted `anchor`.

See also: `TextBufferExt::insert_child_anchor`.
## `location`
position to insert `anchor` in `textbuffer`
## `anchor`
the `TextChildAnchor` to be inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExtManual::fn connect_insert_text -->
The ::insert-text signal is emitted to insert text in a `TextBuffer`.
Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).
The default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
inserted text.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::insert`,
`TextBufferExt::insert_range`.
## `location`
position to insert `text` in `textbuffer`
## `text`
the UTF-8 text to be inserted
## `len`
length of the inserted text in bytes
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_insert_texture -->
The ::insert-texture signal is emitted to insert a `gdk::Texture`
in a `TextBuffer`. Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).
The default signal handler revalidates it to be placed after the
inserted `texture`.

See also: `TextBufferExt::insert_texture`.
## `location`
position to insert `texture` in `textbuffer`
## `texture`
the `gdk::Texture` to be inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_mark_deleted -->
The ::mark-deleted signal is emitted as notification
after a `TextMark` is deleted.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark`.
## `mark`
The mark that was deleted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_mark_set -->
The ::mark-set signal is emitted as notification
after a `TextMark` is set.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::create_mark`,
`TextBufferExt::move_mark`.
## `location`
The location of `mark` in `textbuffer`
## `mark`
The mark that is set
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_modified_changed -->
The ::modified-changed signal is emitted when the modified bit of a
`TextBuffer` flips.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::set_modified`.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_paste_done -->
The paste-done signal is emitted after paste operation has been completed.
This is useful to properly scroll the view to the end of the pasted text.
See `TextBufferExt::paste_clipboard` for more details.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` pasted from
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_remove_tag -->
The ::remove-tag signal is emitted to remove all occurrences of `tag` from
a range of text in a `TextBuffer`.
Removal actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).

See also:

The list of targets this buffer supports for clipboard copying
and as DND source.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_cursor_position -->
The position of the insert mark (as offset from the beginning
of the buffer). It is useful for getting notified when the
cursor moves.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_has_selection -->
Whether the buffer has some text currently selected.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_paste_target_list -->
The list of targets this buffer supports for clipboard pasting
and as DND destination.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_text -->
The text content of the buffer. Without child widgets and images,
see `TextBufferExt::get_text` for more information.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_property_text -->
The text content of the buffer. Without child widgets and images,
see `TextBufferExt::get_text` for more information.
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo -->
These values are used as “info” for the targets contained in the
lists returned by `gtk_text_buffer_get_copy_target_list` and
`gtk_text_buffer_get_paste_target_list`.

The values counts down from `-1` to avoid clashes
with application added drag destinations which usually start at 0.
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant BufferContents -->
Buffer contents
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant RichText -->
Rich text
<!-- enum TextBufferTargetInfo::variant Text -->
Text
<!-- struct TextChildAnchor -->
A `TextChildAnchor` is a spot in the buffer where child widgets can
be “anchored” (inserted inline, as if they were characters). The anchor
can have multiple widgets anchored, to allow for multiple views.

# Implements

[`TextChildAnchorExt`](trait.TextChildAnchorExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt -->
Trait containing all `TextChildAnchor` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextChildAnchor`](struct.TextChildAnchor.html)
<!-- impl TextChildAnchor::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextChildAnchor`. Usually you would then insert
it into a `TextBuffer` with `TextBufferExt::insert_child_anchor`.
To perform the creation and insertion in one step, use the
convenience function `TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor`.

# Returns

a new `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt::fn get_deleted -->
Determines whether a child anchor has been deleted from
the buffer. Keep in mind that the child anchor will be
unreferenced when removed from the buffer, so you need to
hold your own reference (with `gobject::ObjectExt::ref`) if you plan
to use this function — otherwise all deleted child anchors
will also be finalized.

# Returns

`true` if the child anchor has been deleted from its buffer
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt::fn get_widgets -->
Gets a list of all widgets anchored at this child anchor.
The returned list should be freed with `glib::List::free`.

# Returns

list of widgets anchored at `self`
<!-- enum TextDirection -->
Reading directions for text.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant None -->
No direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Ltr -->
Left to right text direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Rtl -->
Right to left text direction.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection -->
Granularity types that extend the text selection. Use the
`TextView::extend-selection` signal to customize the selection.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Word -->
Selects the current word. It is triggered by
 a double-click for example.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Line -->
Selects the current line. It is triggered by
 a triple-click for example.
<!-- struct TextIter -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn assign -->
Assigns the value of `other` to `self`. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be assigned
with `GtkTextIter i = j;`. The
function is used by language bindings.
## `other`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_char -->
Moves backward by one character offset. Returns `true` if movement
was possible; if `self` was the first in the buffer (character
offset 0), `TextIter::backward_char` returns `false` for convenience when
writing loops.

# Returns

whether movement was possible
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_position -->
Like `TextIter::forward_cursor_position`, but moves backward.

# Returns

`true` if we moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_find_char -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_find_char`, but goes backward from `self`.
## `pred`
function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_search -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_search`, but moves backward.

`match_end` will never be set to a `TextIter` located after `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_start` before or at `self`.
## `str`
search string
## `flags`
bitmask of flags affecting the search
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_start`, or `None` for start of buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_start -->
Moves backward to the previous sentence start; if `self` is already at
the start of a sentence, moves backward to the next one. Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_sentence_start` up to `count` times,
or until it returns `false`. If `count` is negative, moves forward
instead of backward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves backward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles before `self`. Sets `self`
to the location of the toggle, or the start of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle before `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the previous visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous visible line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous visible word start. (If `self` is currently
on a word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_visible_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous word start. (If `self` is currently on a
word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn can_insert -->
Considering the default editability of the buffer, and tags that
affect editability, determines whether text inserted at `self` would
be editable. If text inserted at `self` would be editable then the
user should be allowed to insert text at `self`.
`TextBufferExt::insert_interactive` uses this function to decide
whether insertions are allowed at a given position.
## `default_editability`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether text inserted at `self` would be editable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn compare -->
A `qsort`-style function that returns negative if `self` is less than
`rhs`, positive if `self` is greater than `rhs`, and 0 if they’re equal.
Ordering is in character offset order, i.e. the first character in the buffer
is less than the second character in the buffer.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

-1 if `self` is less than `rhs`, 1 if `self` is greater, 0 if they are equal
<!-- impl TextIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically-allocated copy of an iterator. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be copied with a
simple assignment (`GtkTextIter i = j;`). The
function is used by language bindings.

# Returns

a copy of the `self`, free with `TextIter::free`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn editable -->
Returns whether the character at `self` is within an editable region
of text. Non-editable text is “locked” and can’t be changed by the
user via `TextView`. This function is simply a convenience
wrapper around `gtk_text_iter_get_attributes`. If no tags applied
to this text affect editability, `default_setting` will be returned.

You don’t want to use this function to decide whether text can be
inserted at `self`, because for insertion you don’t want to know
whether the char at `self` is inside an editable range, you want to
know whether a new character inserted at `self` would be inside an
editable range. Use `TextIter::can_insert` to handle this
case.
## `default_setting`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether `self` is inside an editable range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to the start of the paragraph
delimiter characters for a line (delimiters will be either a
newline, a carriage return, a carriage return followed by a
newline, or a Unicode paragraph separator character). Note that an
iterator pointing to the \n of a \r\n pair will not be counted as
the end of a line, the line ends before the \r. The end iterator is
considered to be at the end of a line, even though there are no
paragraph delimiter chars there.

# Returns

whether `self` is at the end of a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` ends a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled off at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled off at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the end of the tagged range, but that the character
at `self` is outside the tagged range. In other words,
unlike `TextIter::starts_tag`, if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`,
`TextIter::has_tag` will return `false` for the same parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the end of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_word -->
Determines whether `self` ends a natural-language word. Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn equal -->
Tests whether two iterators are equal, using the fastest possible
mechanism. This function is very fast; you can expect it to perform
better than e.g. getting the character offset for each iterator and
comparing the offsets yourself. Also, it’s a bit faster than
`TextIter::compare`.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if the iterators point to the same place in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_char -->
Moves `self` forward by one character offset. Note that images
embedded in the buffer occupy 1 character slot, so
`TextIter::forward_char` may actually move onto an image instead
of a character, if you have images in your buffer. If `self` is the
end iterator or one character before it, `self` will now point at
the end iterator, and `TextIter::forward_char` returns `false` for
convenience when writing loops.

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters if possible (if `count` would move past the
start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of the
buffer). The return value indicates whether the new position of
`self` is different from its original position, and dereferenceable
(the last iterator in the buffer is not dereferenceable). If `count`
is 0, the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move, may be negative

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward by a single cursor position. Cursor positions
are (unsurprisingly) positions where the cursor can appear. Perhaps
surprisingly, there may not be a cursor position between all
characters. The most common example for European languages would be
a carriage return/newline sequence. For some Unicode characters,
the equivalent of say the letter “a” with an accent mark will be
represented as two characters, first the letter then a "combining
mark" that causes the accent to be rendered; so the cursor can’t go
between those two characters. See also the `pango::LogAttr`-struct and
`pango_break` function.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_find_char -->
Advances `self`, calling `pred` on each character. If
`pred` returns `true`, returns `true` and stops scanning.
If `pred` never returns `true`, `self` is set to `limit` if
`limit` is non-`None`, otherwise to the end iterator.
## `pred`
a function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next line. If the iter is already on the
last line of the buffer, moves the iter to the end of the current line.
If after the operation, the iter is at the end of the buffer and not
dereferencable, returns `false`. Otherwise, returns `true`.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_search -->
Searches forward for `str`. Any match is returned by setting
`match_start` to the first character of the match and `match_end` to the
first character after the match. The search will not continue past
`limit`. Note that a search is a linear or O(n) operation, so you
may wish to use `limit` to avoid locking up your UI on large
buffers.

`match_start` will never be set to a `TextIter` located before `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_end` after or at `self`.
## `str`
a search string
## `flags`
flags affecting how the search is done
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_end`, or `None` for the end of the buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_end -->
Moves forward to the next sentence end. (If `self` is at the end of
a sentence, moves to the next end of sentence.) Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_sentence_end` `count` times (or until
`TextIter::forward_sentence_end` returns `false`). If `count` is
negative, moves backward instead of forward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_end -->
Moves `self` forward to the “end iterator,” which points one past the last
valid character in the buffer. `TextIter::get_char` called on the
end iterator returns 0, which is convenient for writing loops.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_line_end -->
Moves the iterator to point to the paragraph delimiter characters,
which will be either a newline, a carriage return, a carriage
return/newline in sequence, or the Unicode paragraph separator
character. If the iterator is already at the paragraph delimiter
characters, moves to the paragraph delimiter characters for the
next line. If `self` is on the last line in the buffer, which does
not end in paragraph delimiters, moves to the end iterator (end of
the last line), and returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new location is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves forward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles after `self`. Sets `self` to
the location of the toggle, or to the end of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle after `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the next visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next visible line. Returns `true` if there
was a next line to move to, and `false` if `self` was simply moved to
the end of the buffer and is now not dereferenceable, or if `self` was
already at the end of the buffer.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next visible word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_visible_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn free -->
Free an iterator allocated on the heap. This function
is intended for use in language bindings, and is not
especially useful for applications, because iterators can
simply be allocated on the stack.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` this iterator is associated with.

# Returns

the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_bytes_in_line -->
Returns the number of bytes in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of bytes in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_char -->
The Unicode character at this iterator is returned. (Equivalent to
operator* on a C++ iterator.) If the element at this iterator is a
non-character element, such as an image embedded in the buffer, the
Unicode “unknown” character 0xFFFC is returned. If invoked on
the end iterator, zero is returned; zero is not a valid Unicode character.
So you can write a loop which ends when `TextIter::get_char`
returns 0.

# Returns

a Unicode character, or 0 if `self` is not dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_chars_in_line -->
Returns the number of characters in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of characters in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_child_anchor -->
If the location at `self` contains a child anchor, the
anchor is returned (with no new reference count added). Otherwise,
`None` is returned.

# Returns

the anchor at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_language -->
A convenience wrapper around `gtk_text_iter_get_attributes`,
which returns the language in effect at `self`. If no tags affecting
language apply to `self`, the return value is identical to that of
`gtk_get_default_language`.

# Returns

language in effect at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line -->
Returns the line number containing the iterator. Lines in
a `TextBuffer` are numbered beginning with 0 for the first
line in the buffer.

# Returns

a line number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_index -->
Returns the byte index of the iterator, counting
from the start of a newline-terminated line.
Remember that `TextBuffer` encodes text in
UTF-8, and that characters can require a variable
number of bytes to represent.

# Returns

distance from start of line, in bytes
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_offset -->
Returns the character offset of the iterator,
counting from the start of a newline-terminated line.
The first character on the line has offset 0.

# Returns

offset from start of line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_marks -->
Returns a list of all `TextMark` at this location. Because marks
are not iterable (they don’t take up any "space" in the buffer,
they are just marks in between iterable locations), multiple marks
can exist in the same place. The returned list is not in any
meaningful order.

# Returns

list of `TextMark`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_offset -->
Returns the character offset of an iterator.
Each character in a `TextBuffer` has an offset,
starting with 0 for the first character in the buffer.
Use `TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_offset` to convert an
offset back into an iterator.

# Returns

a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the given range. A “slice” is an array of
characters encoded in UTF-8 format, including the Unicode “unknown”
character 0xFFFC for iterable non-character elements in the buffer,
such as images. Because images are encoded in the slice, byte and
character offsets in the returned array will correspond to byte
offsets in the text buffer. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a texture or
widget is in the buffer.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_tags -->
Returns a list of tags that apply to `self`, in ascending order of
priority (highest-priority tags are last). The `TextTag` in the
list don’t have a reference added, but you have to free the list
itself.

# Returns

list of `TextTag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_text -->
Returns text in the given range. If the range
contains non-text elements such as images, the character and byte
offsets in the returned string will not correspond to character and
byte offsets in the buffer. If you want offsets to correspond, see
`TextIter::get_slice`.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

array of characters from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_texture -->
If the element at `self` is a texture, the texture is returned
(with no new reference count added). Otherwise, `None` is returned.

# Returns

the texture at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_toggled_tags -->
Returns a list of `TextTag` that are toggled on or off at this
point. (If `toggled_on` is `true`, the list contains tags that are
toggled on.) If a tag is toggled on at `self`, then some non-empty
range of characters following `self` has that tag applied to it. If
a tag is toggled off, then some non-empty range following `self`
does not have the tag applied to it.
## `toggled_on`
`true` to get toggled-on tags

# Returns

tags toggled at this point
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_index -->
Returns the number of bytes from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting bytes that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

byte index of `self` with respect to the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_offset -->
Returns the offset in characters from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting characters that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

offset in visible characters from the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_slice -->
Like `TextIter::get_slice`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_text -->
Like `TextIter::get_text`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

string containing visible text in the
range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn has_tag -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to a character that is part of a range tagged
with `tag`. See also `TextIter::starts_tag` and `TextIter::ends_tag`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`

# Returns

whether `self` is tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn in_range -->
Checks whether `self` falls in the range [`start`, `end`).
`start` and `end` must be in ascending order.
## `start`
start of range
## `end`
end of range

# Returns

`true` if `self` is in the range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` is inside a sentence (as opposed to in
between two sentences, e.g. after a period and before the first
letter of the next sentence). Sentence boundaries are determined
by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language (if not, the
correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_word -->
Determines whether the character pointed by `self` is part of a
natural-language word (as opposed to say inside some whitespace). Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break algorithms).

Note that if `TextIter::starts_word` returns `true`, then this function
returns `true` too, since `self` points to the first character of the word.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_cursor_position -->
See `TextIter::forward_cursor_position` or `pango::LogAttr` or
`pango_break` for details on what a cursor position is.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor can be placed at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_end -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the end iterator, i.e. one past the last
dereferenceable iterator in the buffer. `TextIter::is_end` is
the most efficient way to check whether an iterator is the end
iterator.

# Returns

whether `self` is the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_start -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the first iterator in the buffer, that is
if `self` has a character offset of 0.

# Returns

whether `self` is the first in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn order -->
Swaps the value of `self` and `second` if `second` comes before
`self` in the buffer. That is, ensures that `self` and `second` are
in sequence. Most text buffer functions that take a range call this
automatically on your behalf, so there’s no real reason to call it yourself
in those cases. There are some exceptions, such as `TextIter::in_range`,
that expect a pre-sorted range.
## `second`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line -->
Moves iterator `self` to the start of the line `line_number`. If
`line_number` is negative or larger than the number of lines in the
buffer, moves `self` to the start of the last line in the buffer.
## `line_number`
line number (counted from 0)
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_index -->
Same as `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but works with a
byte index. The given byte index must be at
the start of a character, it can’t be in the middle of a UTF-8
encoded character.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_offset -->
Moves `self` within a line, to a new character
(not byte) offset. The given character offset must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the line; if equal, `self`
moves to the start of the next line. See
`TextIter::set_line_index` if you have a byte index rather than
a character offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_offset -->
Sets `self` to point to `char_offset`. `char_offset` counts from the start
of the entire text buffer, starting with 0.
## `char_offset`
a character number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_index -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_index`, but the index is in visible
bytes, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not counted
in the index.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_offset -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but the offset is in visible
characters, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not
counted in the offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` begins a paragraph,
i.e. if `TextIter::get_line_offset` would return 0.
However this function is potentially more efficient than
`TextIter::get_line_offset` because it doesn’t have to compute
the offset, it just has to see whether it’s 0.

# Returns

whether `self` begins a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` begins a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled on at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled on at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::starts_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the beginning of the tagged range, and that the
character at `self` is inside the tagged range. In other
words, unlike `TextIter::ends_tag`, if `TextIter::starts_tag` returns
`true`, `TextIter::has_tag` will also return `true` for the same
parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the start of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_word -->
Determines whether `self` begins a natural-language word. Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn toggles_tag -->
This is equivalent to (`TextIter::starts_tag` ||
`TextIter::ends_tag`), i.e. it tells you whether a range with
`tag` applied to it begins or ends at `self`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `tag` is toggled on or off at `self`
<!-- struct TextMark -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.

A `TextMark` is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in
the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
`TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_mark`. Unlike iterators, marks remain valid across
buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or
deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the
position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a
mark, a mark with “left gravity” will be moved to the
beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with “right
gravity” will be moved to the end.

Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
displayed.

Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the validity
of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at any time with
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark`. Once deleted from the buffer, a mark is
essentially useless.

Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the
`TextMark` object around.

Marks are typically created using the `TextBufferExt::create_mark` function.

# Implementors

[`TextMark`](struct.TextMark.html)
<!-- impl TextMark::fn new -->
Creates a text mark. Add it to a buffer using `TextBufferExt::add_mark`.
If `name` is `None`, the mark is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be
retrieved by name using `TextBufferExt::get_mark`. If a mark has left
gravity, and text is inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark
will be moved to the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has
right gravity (`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the
right of newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a
mark with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).
## `name`
mark name or `None`
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark should have left gravity

# Returns

new `TextMark`
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_buffer -->
Gets the buffer this mark is located inside,
or `None` if the mark is deleted.

# Returns

the mark’s `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_deleted -->
Returns `true` if the mark has been removed from its buffer
with `TextBufferExt::delete_mark`. See `TextBufferExt::add_mark`
for a way to add it to a buffer again.

# Returns

whether the mark is deleted
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_left_gravity -->
Determines whether the mark has left gravity.

# Returns

`true` if the mark has left gravity, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_name -->
Returns the mark name; returns NULL for anonymous marks.

# Returns

mark name
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_visible -->
Returns `true` if the mark is visible (i.e. a cursor is displayed
for it).

# Returns

`true` if visible
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_property_left_gravity -->
Whether the mark has left gravity. When text is inserted at the mark’s
current location, if the mark has left gravity it will be moved
to the left of the newly-inserted text, otherwise to the right.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn set_property_left_gravity -->
Whether the mark has left gravity. When text is inserted at the mark’s
current location, if the mark has left gravity it will be moved
to the left of the newly-inserted text, otherwise to the right.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_property_name -->
The name of the mark or `None` if the mark is anonymous.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn set_property_name -->
The name of the mark or `None` if the mark is anonymous.
<!-- struct TextTag -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and
data types related to the text widget and how they work together.

Tags should be in the `TextTagTable` for a given `TextBuffer`
before using them with that buffer.

`TextBufferExt::create_tag` is the best way to create tags.
See “gtk4-demo” for numerous examples.

For each property of `TextTag`, there is a “set” property, e.g.
“font-set” corresponds to “font”. These “set” properties reflect
whether a property has been set or not.
They are maintained by GTK+ and you should not set them independently.

# Implements

[`TextTagExt`](trait.TextTagExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait TextTagExt -->
Trait containing all `TextTag` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextTag`](struct.TextTag.html)
<!-- impl TextTag::fn new -->
Creates a `TextTag`. Configure the tag using object arguments,
i.e. using `gobject::ObjectExt::set`.
## `name`
tag name, or `None`

# Returns

a new `TextTag`
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn changed -->
Emits the `TextTagTable::tag-changed` signal on the `TextTagTable` where
the tag is included.

The signal is already emitted when setting a `TextTag` property. This
function is useful for a `TextTag` subclass.
## `size_changed`
whether the change affects the `TextView` layout.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_priority -->
Get the tag priority.

# Returns

The tag’s priority.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_priority -->
Sets the priority of a `TextTag`. Valid priorities
start at 0 and go to one less than `TextTagTableExt::get_size`.
Each tag in a table has a unique priority; setting the priority
of one tag shifts the priorities of all the other tags in the
table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. Higher priority
tags “win” if two tags both set the same text attribute. When adding
a tag to a tag table, it will be assigned the highest priority in
the table by default; so normally the precedence of a set of tags
is the order in which they were added to the table, or created with
`TextBufferExt::create_tag`, which adds the tag to the buffer’s table
automatically.
## `priority`
the new priority
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_accumulative_margin -->
Whether the margins accumulate or override each other.

When set to `true` the margins of this tag are added to the margins
of any other non-accumulative margins present. When set to `false`
the margins override one another (the default).
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_accumulative_margin -->
Whether the margins accumulate or override each other.

When set to `true` the margins of this tag are added to the margins
of any other non-accumulative margins present. When set to `false`
the margins override one another (the default).

When set to `true`, other fonts will be substituted
where the current font is missing glyphs.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_fallback -->
Whether font fallback is enabled.

When set to `true`, other fonts will be substituted
where the current font is missing glyphs.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_font -->

Note that the initial value of this property depends on
the internals of `pango::FontDescription`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_font -->

text, in particular when navigating programmatically inside a buffer
containing invisible segments.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_invisible -->

Note that there may still be problems with the support for invisible
text, in particular when navigating programmatically inside a buffer

<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_language -->
The language this text is in, as an ISO code. Pango can use this as a
hint when rendering the text. If not set, an appropriate default will be
used.

Note that the initial value of this property depends on the current
locale, see also `gtk_get_default_language`.

# `GtkTextTagTables` as `Buildable`

The `TextTagTable` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding tags by specifying “tag” as the “type” attribute
of a `<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying tags:

```text
<object class="GtkTextTagTable">
 <child type="tag">
   <object class="GtkTextTag"/>
 </child>
</object>

`TextView` has a main css node with name textview and style class .view,
and subnodes for each of the border windows, and the main text area,
with names border and text, respectively. The border nodes each get
one of the style classes .left, .right, .top or .bottom.

A node representing the selection will appear below the text node.

If a context menu is opened, the window node will appear as a subnode
of the main node.

<!-- trait TextViewExt -->
Trait containing all `TextView` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextView`](struct.TextView.html)
<!-- impl TextView::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextView`. If you don’t call `TextViewExt::set_buffer`
before using the text view, an empty default buffer will be created
for you. Get the buffer with `TextViewExt::get_buffer`. If you want
to specify your own buffer, consider `TextView::new_with_buffer`.

# Returns

a new `TextView`
<!-- impl TextView::fn new_with_buffer -->
Creates a new `TextView` widget displaying the buffer
`buffer`. One buffer can be shared among many widgets.
`buffer` may be `None` to create a default buffer, in which case
this function is equivalent to `TextView::new`. The
text view adds its own reference count to the buffer; it does not
take over an existing reference.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`

# Returns

a new `TextView`.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn add_child_at_anchor -->
Adds a child widget in the text buffer, at the given `anchor`.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor` in the `TextBuffer` for `self`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn add_child_in_window -->
Adds a child at fixed coordinates in one of the text widget's
windows.

The window must have nonzero size (see
`TextViewExt::set_border_window_size`). Note that the child
coordinates are given relative to scrolling. When
placing a child in `TextWindowType::Widget`, scrolling is
irrelevant, the child floats above all scrollable areas. But when
placing a child in one of the scrollable windows (border windows or
text window) it will move with the scrolling as needed.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `which_window`
which window the child should appear in
## `xpos`
X position of child in window coordinates
## `ypos`
Y position of child in window coordinates
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn backward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` backward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn backward_display_line_start -->
Moves the given `iter` backward to the next display line start.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn buffer_to_surface_coords -->
Converts coordinate (`buffer_x`, `buffer_y`) to coordinates for the window
`win`, and stores the result in (`window_x`, `window_y`).

Note that you can’t convert coordinates for a nonexisting window (see
`TextViewExt::set_border_window_size`).
## `win`
a `TextWindowType` except `TextWindowType::Private`
## `buffer_x`
buffer x coordinate
## `buffer_y`
buffer y coordinate
## `window_x`
window x coordinate return location or `None`

<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn forward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` forward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn forward_display_line_end -->
Moves the given `iter` forward to the next display line end.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_accepts_tab -->
Returns whether pressing the Tab key inserts a tab characters.
`TextViewExt::set_accepts_tab`.

# Returns

`true` if pressing the Tab key inserts a tab character,
 `false` if pressing the Tab key moves the keyboard focus.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_border_window_size -->
Gets the width of the specified border window. See
`TextViewExt::set_border_window_size`.
## `type_`
window to return size from

# Returns

width of window
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_bottom_margin -->
Gets the bottom margin for text in the `self`.

# Returns

bottom margin in pixels
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` being displayed by this text view.
The reference count on the buffer is not incremented; the caller
of this function won’t own a new reference.

# Returns

a `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_cursor_locations -->
Given an `iter` within a text layout, determine the positions of the
strong and weak cursors if the insertion point is at that
iterator. The position of each cursor is stored as a zero-width
rectangle. The strong cursor location is the location where
characters of the directionality equal to the base direction of the
paragraph are inserted. The weak cursor location is the location
where characters of the directionality opposite to the base
direction of the paragraph are inserted.

If `iter` is `None`, the actual cursor position is used.

Note that if `iter` happens to be the actual cursor position, and
there is currently an IM preedit sequence being entered, the
returned locations will be adjusted to account for the preedit
cursor’s offset within the preedit sequence.

The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextViewExt::buffer_to_surface_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `strong`
location to store the strong
 cursor position (may be `None`)
## `weak`
location to store the weak
 cursor position (may be `None`)
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_cursor_visible -->
Find out whether the cursor should be displayed.

# Returns

whether the insertion mark is visible
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_editable -->
Returns the default editability of the `TextView`. Tags in the
buffer may override this setting for some ranges of text.

# Returns

whether text is editable by default
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_indent -->
Gets the default indentation of paragraphs in `self`.
Tags in the view’s buffer may override the default.
The indentation may be negative.

# Returns

number of pixels of indentation
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_input_hints -->
Gets the value of the `TextView:input-hints` property.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_input_purpose -->
Gets the value of the `TextView:input-purpose` property.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_at_location -->
Retrieves the iterator at buffer coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer
coordinates are coordinates for the entire buffer, not just the
currently-displayed portion. If you have coordinates from an
event, you have to convert those to buffer coordinates with
`TextViewExt::window_to_buffer_coords`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `x`
x position, in buffer coordinates
## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates

# Returns

`true` if the position is over text
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_at_position -->
Retrieves the iterator pointing to the character at buffer
coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer coordinates are coordinates for
the entire buffer, not just the currently-displayed portion.
If you have coordinates from an event, you have to convert
those to buffer coordinates with
`TextViewExt::window_to_buffer_coords`.

Note that this is different from `TextViewExt::get_iter_at_location`,
which returns cursor locations, i.e. positions between
characters.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `trailing`
if non-`None`, location to store an integer indicating where
 in the grapheme the user clicked. It will either be
 zero, or the number of characters in the grapheme.
 0 represents the trailing edge of the grapheme.
## `x`
x position, in buffer coordinates
## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates

# Returns

`true` if the position is over text
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_location -->
Gets a rectangle which roughly contains the character at `iter`.
The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextViewExt::buffer_to_surface_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `location`
bounds of the character at `iter`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_justification -->
Gets the default justification of paragraphs in `self`.
Tags in the buffer may override the default.

# Returns

default justification
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_left_margin -->
Gets the default left margin size of paragraphs in the `self`.
Tags in the buffer may override the default.

# Returns

left margin in pixels
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_line_at_y -->
Gets the `TextIter` at the start of the line containing
the coordinate `y`. `y` is in buffer coordinates, convert from
window coordinates with `TextViewExt::window_to_buffer_coords`.
If non-`None`, `line_top` will be filled with the coordinate of the top
edge of the line.
## `target_iter`
a `TextIter`
## `y`
a y coordinate
## `line_top`
return location for top coordinate of the line
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_line_yrange -->
Gets the y coordinate of the top of the line containing `iter`,
and the height of the line. The coordinate is a buffer coordinate;
convert to window coordinates with `TextViewExt::buffer_to_surface_coords`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `y`
return location for a y coordinate
## `height`

<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_tabs -->
Gets the default tabs for `self`. Tags in the buffer may
override the defaults. The returned array will be `None` if
“standard” (8-space) tabs are used. Free the return value
with `pango::TabArray::free`.

Gets the line wrapping for the view.

# Returns

the line wrap setting
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn im_context_filter_keypress -->
Allow the `TextView` input method to internally handle key press
and release events. If this function returns `true`, then no further
processing should be done for this key event. See
`IMContextExt::filter_keypress`.

Note that you are expected to call this function from your handler
when overriding key event handling. This is needed in the case when
you need to insert your own key handling between the input method
and the default key event handling of the `TextView`.


```C
static gboolean
gtk_foo_bar_key_press_event (GtkWidget   *widget,
                             GdkEventKey *event)
{
  guint keyval;
  
  gdk_event_get_keyval ((GdkEvent*)event, &keyval);

  if (keyval == GDK_KEY_Return || keyval == GDK_KEY_KP_Enter)
    {
      if (gtk_text_view_im_context_filter_keypress (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (widget), event))
        return TRUE;
    }

  // Do some stuff

  return GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (gtk_foo_bar_parent_class)->key_press_event (widget, event);
}
```
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_child -->
Updates the position of a child, as for `TextViewExt::add_child_in_window`.
## `child`
child widget already added to the text view
## `xpos`
new X position in window coordinates
## `ypos`
new Y position in window coordinates
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_mark_onscreen -->
Moves a mark within the buffer so that it's
located within the currently-visible text area.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`

# Returns

`true` if the mark moved (wasn’t already onscreen)
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_visually -->
Move the iterator a given number of characters visually, treating
it as the strong cursor position. If `count` is positive, then the
new strong cursor position will be `count` positions to the right of
the old cursor position. If `count` is negative then the new strong
cursor position will be `count` positions to the left of the old
cursor position.

In the presence of bi-directional text, the correspondence
between logical and visual order will depend on the direction
of the current run, and there may be jumps when the cursor
is moved off of the end of a run.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `count`
number of characters to move (negative moves left,
 positive moves right)

# Returns

`true` if `iter` moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn place_cursor_onscreen -->
Moves the cursor to the currently visible region of the
buffer, it it isn’t there already.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor had to be moved.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn reset_cursor_blink -->
Ensures that the cursor is shown (i.e. not in an 'off' blink
interval) and resets the time that it will stay blinking (or
visible, in case blinking is disabled).

This function should be called in response to user input
(e.g. from derived classes that override the textview's
event handlers).
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn reset_im_context -->
Reset the input method context of the text view if needed.

This can be necessary in the case where modifying the buffer
would confuse on-going input method behavior.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_mark_onscreen -->
Scrolls `self` the minimum distance such that `mark` is contained
within the visible area of the widget.
## `mark`
a mark in the buffer for `self`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_to_iter -->
Scrolls `self` so that `iter` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.

Note that this function uses the currently-computed height of the
lines in the text buffer. Line heights are computed in an idle
handler; so this function may not have the desired effect if it’s
called before the height computations. To avoid oddness, consider
using `TextViewExt::scroll_to_mark` which saves a point to be
scrolled to after line validation.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments (if `false`,
 just get the mark onscreen)

## `yalign`
vertical alignment of mark within visible area

# Returns

`true` if scrolling occurred
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_to_mark -->
Scrolls `self` so that `mark` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size

If `accepts_tab` is `true`, a tab character is inserted. If `accepts_tab`
is `false` the keyboard focus is moved to the next widget in the focus
chain.
## `accepts_tab`
`true` if pressing the Tab key should insert a tab
 character, `false`, if pressing the Tab key should move the
 keyboard focus.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_border_window_size -->
Sets the width of `TextWindowType::Left` or `TextWindowType::Right`,
or the height of `TextWindowType::Top` or `TextWindowType::Bottom`.
Automatically destroys the corresponding window if the size is set
to 0, and creates the window if the size is set to non-zero. This
function can only be used for the “border windows,” it doesn’t work
with `TextWindowType::Widget`, `TextWindowType::Text`, or
`TextWindowType::Private`.
## `type_`
window to affect
## `size`
width or height of the window

bottom margin in pixels
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_buffer -->
Sets `buffer` as the buffer being displayed by `self`. The previous
buffer displayed by the text view is unreferenced, and a reference is
added to `buffer`. If you owned a reference to `buffer` before passing it
to this function, you must remove that reference yourself; `TextView`
will not “adopt” it.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_cursor_visible -->
Toggles whether the insertion point should be displayed. A buffer with
no editable text probably shouldn’t have a visible cursor, so you may
want to turn the cursor off.

Note that this property may be overridden by the
`Settings:gtk-keynave-use-caret` settings.
## `setting`
whether to show the insertion cursor
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_editable -->

a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` begins a wrapped line
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn window_to_buffer_coords -->
Converts coordinates on the window identified by `win` to buffer
coordinates, storing the result in (`buffer_x`,`buffer_y`).

<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `text_view`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifer does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual characters/lines
- Ctrl-arrow key combinations move by words/paragraphs

context menu of the text view.

If you need to add items to the context menu, connect
to this signal and append your items to the `popup`, which
will be a `Menu` in this case.

If `TextView:populate-all` is `true`, this signal will
also be emitted to populate touch popups. In this case,
`popup` will be a different container, e.g. a `Toolbar`.

The signal handler should not make assumptions about the
type of `widget`, but check whether `popup` is a `Menu`
or `Toolbar` or another kind of container.
## `popup`
the container that is being populated
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn connect_preedit_changed -->
If an input method is used, the typed text will not immediately

<!-- struct ToggleButton -->
A `ToggleButton` is a `Button` which will remain “pressed-in” when
clicked. Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its
normal state.

A toggle button is created by calling either `ToggleButton::new` or
`ToggleButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, it is advisable to
pack a widget, (such as a `Label` and/or a `Image`), into the toggle
button’s container. (See `Button` for more information).

The state of a `ToggleButton` can be set specifically using
`ToggleButtonExt::set_active`, and retrieved using
`ToggleButtonExt::get_active`.

To simply switch the state of a toggle button, use `ToggleButtonExt::toggled`.

# CSS nodes

`ToggleButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .toggle style class.

## Creating two `ToggleButton` widgets.


```C
static void output_state (GtkToggleButton *source, gpointer user_data) {
  printf ("Active: %d\n", gtk_toggle_button_get_active (source));
}

void make_toggles (void) {
  GtkWidget *window, *toggle1, *toggle2;
  GtkWidget *box;
  const char *text;

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  box = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 12);

  text = "Hi, I’m a toggle button.";
  toggle1 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);

  g_signal_connect (toggle1, "toggled",
                    G_CALLBACK (output_state),
                    NULL);
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), toggle1);

  text = "Hi, I’m a toggle button.";
  toggle2 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);
  g_signal_connect (toggle2, "toggled",
                    G_CALLBACK (output_state),
                    NULL);
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (box), toggle2);

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), box);
  gtk_widget_show (window);
}
```

<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_active -->
Sets the status of the toggle button. Set to `true` if you want the
`ToggleButton` to be “pressed in”, and `false` to raise it.
This action causes the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal and the
`Button::clicked` signal to be emitted.
## `is_active`
`true` or `false`.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn toggled -->
Emits the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal on the
`ToggleButton`. There is no good reason for an

``GtkToolButtons`` are ``GtkToolItems`` containing buttons.

Use `ToolButton::new` to create a new `ToolButton`.

The label of a `ToolButton` is determined by the properties
`ToolButton:label-widget` and `ToolButton:label`.
If `ToolButton:label-widget` is
non-`None`, then that widget is used as the label. Otherwise, if
`ToolButton:label` is non-`None`, that string is used as the label.

The icon of a `ToolButton` is determined by the
`ToolButton:icon-widget` property. If
`ToolButton:icon-widget` is non-`None`, then
that widget is used as the icon. Otherwise it does not have an icon.

- `ToolbarStyle::Text`, meaning the tool item should only show text
- `ToolbarStyle::BothHoriz`, meaning the tool item should show
 both an icon and a label, arranged horizontally

# Returns

A `ToolbarStyle` indicating the toolbar style used
for `self`.
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn get_visible_horizontal -->
Returns whether the `self` is visible on toolbars that are
docked horizontally.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is visible on toolbars that are

Returns whether `self` is visible when the toolbar is docked vertically.
See `ToolItemExt::set_visible_vertical`.

# Returns

Whether `self` is visible when the toolbar is docked vertically
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn rebuild_menu -->
Calling this function signals to the toolbar that the
overflow menu item for `self` has changed. If the
overflow menu is visible when this function it called,
the menu will be rebuilt.

The function must be called when the tool item changes what it
will do in response to the `ToolItem::create-menu-proxy` signal.
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn retrieve_proxy_menu_item -->
Returns the `MenuItem` that was last set by
`ToolItemExt::set_proxy_menu_item`, ie. the `MenuItem`
that is going to appear in the overflow menu.

# Returns

The `MenuItem` that is going to appear in the
overflow menu for `self`.
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_expand -->
Sets whether `self` is allocated extra space when there
is more room on the toolbar then needed for the items. The
effect is that the item gets bigger when the toolbar gets bigger
and smaller when the toolbar gets smaller.
## `expand`
Whether `self` is allocated extra space
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_homogeneous -->
Sets whether `self` is to be allocated the same size as other
homogeneous items. The effect is that all homogeneous items will have
the same width as the widest of the items.
## `homogeneous`
whether `self` is the same size as other homogeneous items
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_is_important -->
Sets whether `self` should be considered important. The `ToolButton`
class uses this property to determine whether to show or hide its label
when the toolbar style is `ToolbarStyle::BothHoriz`. The result is that
only tool buttons with the “is_important” property set have labels, an
effect known as “priority text”
## `is_important`
whether the tool item should be considered important
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_proxy_menu_item -->
Sets the `MenuItem` used in the toolbar overflow menu. The
`menu_item_id` is used to identify the caller of this function and
should also be used with `ToolItemExt::get_proxy_menu_item`.

See also `ToolItem::create-menu-proxy`.
## `menu_item_id`
a string used to identify `menu_item`
## `menu_item`
a `MenuItem` to use in the overflow menu, or `None`

text to be used as tooltip for `self`
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_visible_horizontal -->
Sets whether `self` is visible when the toolbar is docked horizontally.
## `visible_horizontal`
Whether `self` is visible when in horizontal mode
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn set_visible_vertical -->
Sets whether `self` is visible when the toolbar is docked
vertically. Some tool items, such as text entries, are too wide to be
useful on a vertically docked toolbar. If `visible_vertical` is `false`
`self` will not appear on toolbars that are docked vertically.
## `visible_vertical`
whether `self` is visible when the toolbar
is in vertical mode
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn toolbar_reconfigured -->
Emits the signal `ToolItem::toolbar_reconfigured` on `self`.
`Toolbar` and other `ToolShell` implementations use this function
to notify children, when some aspect of their configuration changes.
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn connect_create_menu_proxy -->
This signal is emitted when the toolbar needs information from `tool_item`
about whether the item should appear in the toolbar overflow menu. In
response the tool item should either

- call `ToolItemExt::set_proxy_menu_item` with a `None`
 pointer and return `true` to indicate that the item should not appear
 in the overflow menu

- call `ToolItemExt::set_proxy_menu_item` with a new menu
 item and return `true`, or

- return `false` to indicate that the signal was not handled by the item.
 This means that the item will not appear in the overflow menu unless
 a later handler installs a menu item.

The toolbar may cache the result of this signal. When the tool item changes
how it will respond to this signal it must call `ToolItemExt::rebuild_menu`
to invalidate the cache and ensure that the toolbar rebuilds its overflow
menu.

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled, `false` if not
<!-- trait ToolItemExt::fn connect_toolbar_reconfigured -->
This signal is emitted when some property of the toolbar that the
item is a child of changes. For custom subclasses of `ToolItem`,
the default handler of this signal use the functions
- `ToolShell::get_orientation`
- `ToolShell::get_style`
- `gtk_tool_shell_get_icon_size`
to find out what the toolbar should look like and change
themselves accordingly.
<!-- struct ToolShell -->

call this function directly, but rely on `ToolItemExt::get_text_size_group`
instead.

# Returns

the current text size group of `self`
<!-- trait ToolShellExt::fn rebuild_menu -->
Calling this function signals the tool shell that the overflow menu item for
tool items have changed. If there is an overflow menu and if it is visible
when this function it called, the menu will be rebuilt.

Tool items must not call this function directly, but rely on
`ToolItemExt::rebuild_menu` instead.
<!-- struct Toolbar -->
A toolbar is created with a call to `Toolbar::new`.

A toolbar can contain instances of a subclass of `ToolItem`. To add
a `ToolItem` to the a toolbar, use `ToolbarExt::insert`. To remove
an item from the toolbar use `ContainerExt::remove`. To add a button
to the toolbar, add an instance of `ToolButton`.

Toolbar items can be visually grouped by adding instances of
`SeparatorToolItem` to the toolbar. If the `ToolItem` property
“expand” is `true` and the property `SeparatorToolItem:draw` is set to
`false`, the effect is to force all following items to the end of the toolbar.

By default, a toolbar can be shrunk, upon which it will add an arrow button
to show an overflow menu offering access to any `ToolItem` child that has
a proxy menu item. To disable this and request enough size for all children,
call `ToolbarExt::set_show_arrow` to set `Toolbar:show-arrow` to `false`.

Creating a context menu for the toolbar can be done by connecting to
the `Toolbar::popup-context-menu` signal.

<!-- struct Tooltip -->
Basic tooltips can be realized simply by using `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text`
or `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup` without any explicit tooltip object.

When you need a tooltip with a little more fancy contents, like adding an
image, or you want the tooltip to have different contents per `TreeView`
row or cell, you will have to do a little more work:

- Set the `Widget:has-tooltip` property to `true`, this will make GTK+
 monitor the widget for motion and related events which are needed to
 determine when and where to show a tooltip.

- Connect to the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal. This signal will be
 emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown. One of the arguments passed
 to the signal handler is a `Tooltip` object. This is the object that we
 are about to display as a tooltip, and can be manipulated in your callback
 using functions like `Tooltip::set_icon`. There are functions for setting
 the tooltip’s markup, setting an image from a named icon, or even putting in
 a custom widget.

 Return `true` from your query-tooltip handler. This causes the tooltip to be
 show. If you return `false`, it will not be shown.

In the probably rare case where you want to have even more control over the
tooltip that is about to be shown, you can set your own `Window` which
will be used as tooltip window. This works as follows:

- Set `Widget:has-tooltip` and connect to `Widget::query-tooltip` as before.
 Use `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_window` to set a `Window` created by you as
 tooltip window.

- In the `Widget::query-tooltip` callback you can access your window using
 `WidgetExt::get_tooltip_window` and manipulate as you wish. The semantics of
 the return value are exactly as before, return `true` to show the window,
 `false` to not show it.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_custom -->
Replaces the widget packed into the tooltip with
`custom_widget`. `custom_widget` does not get destroyed when the tooltip goes
away.

the tooltip, which can be configured using `Tooltip::set_markup`
and `Tooltip::set_icon`.
## `custom_widget`
a `Widget`, or `None` to unset the old custom widget.
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
`paintable`. If `paintable` is `None`, the image will be hidden.

by `size`. If `icon_name` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `icon_name`
an icon name, or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_markup -->
Sets the text of the tooltip to be `markup`, which is marked up
with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
If `markup` is `None`, the label will be hidden.
## `markup`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat]) or `None`

Sets the area of the widget, where the contents of this tooltip apply,
to be `rect` (in widget coordinates). This is especially useful for
properly setting tooltips on `TreeView` rows and cells, ``GtkIconViews``,
etc.

For setting tooltips on `TreeView`, please refer to the convenience
functions for this: `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_row` and
`TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_cell`.

<!-- trait TreeDragDestExt::fn drag_data_received -->
Asks the `TreeDragDest` to insert a row before the path `dest`,
deriving the contents of the row from `selection_data`. If `dest` is
outside the tree so that inserting before it is impossible, `false`
will be returned. Also, `false` may be returned if the new row is
not created for some model-specific reason. Should robustly handle
a `dest` no longer found in the model!

data to drop

# Returns

whether a new row was created before position `dest`
<!-- trait TreeDragDestExt::fn row_drop_possible -->
Determines whether a drop is possible before the given `dest_path`,
at the same depth as `dest_path`. i.e., can we drop the data in
`selection_data` at that location. `dest_path` does not have to
exist; the return value will almost certainly be `false` if the
parent of `dest_path` doesn’t exist, though.

# Returns

`true` if the row was successfully deleted
<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt::fn drag_data_get -->
Asks the `TreeDragSource` to fill in `selection_data` with a

<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt::fn row_draggable -->
Asks the `TreeDragSource` whether a particular row can be used as
the source of a DND operation. If the source doesn’t implement
this interface, the row is assumed draggable.
## `path`
row on which user is initiating a drag

# Returns

`true` if the row can be dragged
<!-- struct TreeIter -->
The `TreeIter` is the primary structure
for accessing a `TreeModel`. Models are expected to put a unique
integer in the `stamp` member, and put
model-specific data in the three `user_data`
members.
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically allocated tree iterator as a copy of `self`.

This function is not intended for use in applications,
because you can just copy the structs by value
(`GtkTreeIter new_iter = iter;`).
You must free this iter with `TreeIter::free`.

# Returns

a newly-allocated copy of `self`
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn free -->
Frees an iterator that has been allocated by `TreeIter::copy`.

This function is mainly used for language bindings.

that get added. This can be either rows added by changes to the
underlying models or via `gtk_tree_list_model_set_expanded`.

# Returns

`true` if the model is set to autoexpand
<!-- trait TreeListModelExt::fn get_child_row -->
Gets the row item corresponding to the child at index `position` for
`self`'s root model.

If `position` is greater than the number of children in the root model,
`None` is returned.

Do not confuse this function with `TreeListModelExt::get_row`.
## `position`
position of the child to get

# Returns

the child in `position`
<!-- trait TreeListModelExt::fn get_model -->
Gets the root model that `self` was created with.

# Returns

the root model
<!-- trait TreeListModelExt::fn get_passthrough -->
If this function returns `false`, the `gio::ListModel` functions for `self`
return custom `TreeListRow` objects. You need to call
`TreeListRowExt::get_item` on these objects to get the original
item.

If `true`, the values of the child models are passed through in their
original state. You then need to call `TreeListModelExt::get_row`
to get the custom ``GtkTreeListRows``.

# Returns

`true` if the model is passing through original row items
<!-- trait TreeListModelExt::fn get_row -->
Gets the row object for the given row. If `position` is greater than
the number of items in `self`, `None` is returned.

The row object can be used to expand and collapse rows as well as
to inspect its position in the tree. See its documentation for details.

This row object is persistent and will refer to the current item as
long as the row is present in `self`, independent of other rows being
added or removed.

If `self` is set to not be passthrough, this function is equivalent
to calling `gio::ListModel::get_item`.

Do not confuse this function with `TreeListModelExt::get_child_row`.
## `position`
the position of the row to fetch

# Returns

The row item
<!-- trait TreeListModelExt::fn set_autoexpand -->
If set to `true`, the model will recursively expand all rows that
get added to the model. This can be either rows added by changes

and contains the original items, no matter what value
`TreeListModel:passthrough` is set to.

# Returns

The model containing the children
<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn get_depth -->
Gets the depth of this row. Rows that correspond to items in
the root model have a depth of zero, rows corresponding to items
of models of direct children of the root model have a depth of
1 and so on.

The depth of a row never changes until the row is destroyed.

# Returns

The depth of this row
<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn get_expanded -->
Gets if a row is currently expanded.

# Returns

`true` if the row is expanded

<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn get_parent -->
Gets the row representing the parent for `self`. That is the row that would
need to be collapsed to make this row disappear.

If `self` is a row corresponding to the root model, `None` is returned.

The value returned by this function never changes until the
row is destroyed.

# Returns

The parent of `self`
<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn get_position -->
Returns the position in the `TreeListModel` that `self` occupies
at the moment.

# Returns

The position in the model
<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn is_expandable -->
Checks if a row can be expanded. This does not mean that the
row is actually expanded, this can be checked with
`TreeListRowExt::get_expanded`

If a row is expandable never changes until the row is destroyed.

# Returns

`true` if the row is expandable
<!-- trait TreeListRowExt::fn set_expanded -->
Expands or collapses a row.

If a row is expanded, the model of calling the

<!-- struct TreeModel -->
The `TreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
use by the `TreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
type for it to be viewable by a `TreeView` widget.

The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
every node has different values depending on which column is being
queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
model decides how and if changes are made.

In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
— the `TreeStore` and the `ListStore`. To use these, the
developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
these two models are sufficient.

Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
particular node in a model. They are the `TreePath`-struct and
the `TreeIter`-struct (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
interface consists of operations on a `TreeIter`-struct.

A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
model. The `TreePath`-struct can be converted into either an
array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
the third node.

By contrast, a `TreeIter`-struct is a reference to a specific node on
a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
`TreeModel::get_iter`. These iterators are the primary way
of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
`TextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
a set of operations using them for navigating the model.

It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
For example, the `ListStore` model, which is internally a simple
linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
`TreeModelSort` stores an array and an offset in two of the
pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.

The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
to is valid (most notably the `TreeStore` and `ListStore`).
Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
As a result, the `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag was added to
indicate this behavior.

To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
callbacks.

## Acquiring a `TreeIter`-struct


```C
// Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
GtkTreePath *path;
GtkTreeIter iter;
GtkTreeIter parent_iter;

// get the iterator from a string
gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                     &iter,
                                     "3:2:5");

// get the iterator from a path
path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
gtk_tree_path_free (path);

// walk the tree to find the iterator
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               NULL, 3);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 2);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 5);
```

This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
`populate_model` function used below is not
shown, as it is specific to the `ListStore`. For information on
how to write such a function, see the `ListStore` documentation.

## Reading data from a `TreeModel`


```C
enum
{
  STRING_COLUMN,
  INT_COLUMN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

...

GtkTreeModel *list_store;
GtkTreeIter iter;
gboolean valid;
gint row_count = 0;

// make a new list_store
list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                 G_TYPE_STRING,
                                 G_TYPE_INT);

// Fill the list store with data
populate_model (list_store);

// Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
// through the list, reading each row.

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                       &iter);
while (valid)
 {
   gchar *str_data;
   gint   int_data;

   // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
   gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                       STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                       INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                       -1);

   // Do something with the data
   g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
            row_count, str_data, int_data);
   g_free (str_data);

   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                     &iter);
   row_count++;
 }
```

The `TreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
counting: `TreeModel::ref_node` and `TreeModel::unref_node`.
These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
displayed. `TreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
folders that are currently expanded in every current view.

When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
into account:

- Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
 This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
 as well.

- Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
 possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
 row-deleted signal is received.

- Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
 siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
 required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
 however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
 is always referenced when any view is attached).

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_children -->
Sets `iter` to point to the first child of `parent`.

If `parent` has no children, `false` is returned and `iter` is
set to be invalid. `parent` will remain a valid node after this
function has been called.

If `parent` is `None` returns the first node, equivalent to
`gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (tree_model, iter);`

The first index is 0. If `n` is too big, or `parent` has no children,
`iter` is set to an invalid iterator and `false` is returned. `parent`
will remain a valid node after this function has been called. As a
special case, if `parent` is `None`, then the `n`-th root node
is set.

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_parent -->
Sets `iter` to be the parent of `child`.

If `child` is at the toplevel, and doesn’t have a parent, then
`iter` is set to an invalid iterator and `false` is returned.
`child` will remain a valid node after this function has been
called.

`iter` will be initialized before the lookup is performed, so `child`
and `iter` cannot point to the same memory location.

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_previous -->
Sets `iter` to point to the previous node at the current level.

If there is no previous `iter`, `false` is returned and `iter` is
set to be invalid.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct

`true` if `iter` has been changed to the previous node
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn ref_node -->
Lets the tree ref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons.

This function is primarily meant as a way for views to let
caching models know when nodes are being displayed (and hence,
whether or not to cache that node). Being displayed means a node
is in an expanded branch, regardless of whether the node is currently
visible in the viewport. For example, a file-system based model
would not want to keep the entire file-hierarchy in memory,
just the sections that are currently being displayed by
every current view.

A model should be expected to be able to get an iter independent
of its reffed state.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_changed -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-changed` signal on `self`.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_deleted -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-deleted` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models after a row has been removed.
The location pointed to by `path` should be the location that
the row previously was at. It may not be a valid location anymore.

Nodes that are deleted are not unreffed, this means that any
outstanding references on the deleted node should not be released.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the previous location of
 the deleted row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_has_child_toggled -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-has-child-toggled` signal on
`self`. This should be called by models after the child
state of a node changes.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_inserted -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal on `self`.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the inserted row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the inserted row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn rows_reordered -->
Emits the `TreeModel::rows-reordered` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models when their rows have been
reordered.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node whose children
 have been reordered, or `None` if the depth of `path` is 0
## `new_order`

 each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`

Emits the `TreeModel::rows-reordered` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models when their rows have been
reordered.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node
 whose children have been reordered, or `None` if the depth
 of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers
 mapping the current position of each child to its old
 position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`
## `length`
length of `new_order` array
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn sort_new_with_model -->
Creates a new `TreeModel`, with `self` as the child model.

# Returns

A new `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn unref_node -->
Lets the tree unref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons. For more information on what
this means, see `TreeModel::ref_node`.

Please note that nodes that are deleted are not unreffed.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_changed -->
This signal is emitted when a row in the model has changed.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_deleted -->
This signal is emitted when a row has been deleted.

Note that no iterator is passed to the signal handler,
since the row is already deleted.

This should be called by models after a row has been removed.
The location pointed to by `path` should be the location that
the row previously was at. It may not be a valid location anymore.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_has_child_toggled -->
This signal is emitted when a row has gotten the first child
row or lost its last child row.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_inserted -->
This signal is emitted when a new row has been inserted in
the model.

Note that the row may still be empty at this point, since
it is a common pattern to first insert an empty row, and
then fill it with the desired values.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the new row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the new row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_rows_reordered -->
This signal is emitted when the children of a node in the
`TreeModel` have been reordered.

Note that this signal is not emitted
when rows are reordered by DND, since this is implemented
by removing and then reinserting the row.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node whose children
 have been reordered, or `None` if the depth of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the current position
 of each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`
<!-- struct TreeModelFilter -->
A `TreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
and can do the following things:

- Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
 storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
 or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
 model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
 row should be filtered or not.

- Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
 This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
 values and also for creating a completely different model based
 on the given child model.

- Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
 in a `TreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
 time.

The basic API is similar to `TreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
see the section on `TreeModelSort`.

When using `TreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
`TreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
exposed by the child model. `TreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
because of reference counting rule 3, see the `TreeModel`
documentation. (Note that e.g. `TreeStore` does not implement
reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
the receiving node is not visible).

Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
nodes (see reference couting rule number 3 in the `TreeModel` section).

Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
`TreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.

This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
to accommodate this, `TreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `TreeModelFilter`'s
clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
was not cached), `TreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
of any parent node has changed.

Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
own. In this case, either rely on `TreeStore` to emit all signals
because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
yourself.

<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeModelFilter` methods.

# Implementors

<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn clear_cache -->
This function should almost never be called. It clears the `self`
of any cached iterators that haven’t been reffed with
`TreeModel::ref_node`. This might be useful if the child model
being filtered is static (and doesn’t change often) and there has been
a lot of unreffed access to nodes. As a side effect of this function,
all unreffed iters will be invalid.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_child_iter_to_iter -->
Sets `filter_iter` to point to the row in `self` that corresponds to the
row pointed at by `child_iter`. If `filter_iter` was not set, `false` is
returned.
## `filter_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `child_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on the child model.

# Returns

`true`, if `filter_iter` was set, i.e. if `child_iter` is a
valid iterator pointing to a visible row in child model.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_child_path_to_path -->
Converts `child_path` to a path relative to `self`. That is, `child_path`
points to a path in the child model. The rerturned path will point to the
same row in the filtered model. If `child_path` isn’t a valid path on the
child model or points to a row which is not visible in `self`, then `None`
is returned.
## `child_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_iter_to_child_iter -->
Sets `child_iter` to point to the row pointed to by `filter_iter`.
## `child_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `filter_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on `self`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_path_to_child_path -->
Converts `filter_path` to a path on the child model of `self`. That is,
`filter_path` points to a location in `self`. The returned path will
point to the same location in the model not being filtered. If `filter_path`
does not point to a location in the child model, `None` is returned.
## `filter_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn get_model -->
Returns a pointer to the child model of `self`.

# Returns

A pointer to a `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn refilter -->
Emits ::row_changed for each row in the child model, which causes
the filter to re-evaluate whether a row is visible or not.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_modify_func -->
With the `n_columns` and `types` parameters, you give an array of column
types for this model (which will be exposed to the parent model/view).
The `func`, `data` and `destroy` parameters are for specifying the modify
function. The modify function will get called for each
data access, the goal of the modify function is to return the data which
should be displayed at the location specified using the parameters of the
modify function.

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_modify_func`
can only be called once for a given filter model.
## `n_columns`
The number of columns in the filter model.
## `types`
The `GTypes` of the columns.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterModifyFunc``
## `data`
User data to pass to the modify function, or `None`.
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_visible_column -->
Sets `column` of the child_model to be the column where `self` should
look for visibility information. `columns` should be a column of type
`G_TYPE_BOOLEAN`, where `true` means that a row is visible, and `false`
if not.

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `column`
A `gint` which is the column containing the visible information
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_visible_func -->
Sets the visible function used when filtering the `self` to be `func`.
The function should return `true` if the given row should be visible and
`false` otherwise.

If the condition calculated by the function changes over time (e.g.
because it depends on some global parameters), you must call
`TreeModelFilterExt::refilter` to keep the visibility information
of the model up-to-date.

Note that `func` is called whenever a row is inserted, when it may still
be empty. The visible function should therefore take special care of empty
rows, like in the example below.


```C
static gboolean
visible_func (GtkTreeModel *model,
              GtkTreeIter  *iter,
              gpointer      data)
{
  // Visible if row is non-empty and first column is “HI”
  gchar *str;
  gboolean visible = FALSE;

  gtk_tree_model_get (model, iter, 0, &str, -1);
  if (str && strcmp (str, "HI") == 0)
    visible = TRUE;
  g_free (str);

  return visible;
}
```

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``, the visible function
## `data`
User data to pass to the visible function, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`
<!-- struct TreeModelSort -->
The `TreeModelSort` is a model which implements the `TreeSortable`
interface. It does not hold any data itself, but rather is created with
a child model and proxies its data. It has identical column types to
this child model, and the changes in the child are propagated. The
primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different
model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by
`TreeModelSort` is not guaranteed to be stable.

The use of this is best demonstrated through an example. In the
following sample code we create two `TreeView` widgets each with a
view of the same data. As the model is wrapped here by a
`TreeModelSort`, the two ``GtkTreeViews`` can each sort their
view of the data without affecting the other. By contrast, if we
simply put the same model in each widget, then sorting the first would
sort the second.

## Using a `TreeModelSort`


```C
{
  GtkTreeView *tree_view1;
  GtkTreeView *tree_view2;
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model1;
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model2;
  GtkTreeModel *child_model;

  // get the child model
  child_model = get_my_model ();

  // Create the first tree
  sort_model1 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
  tree_view1 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model1);

  // Create the second tree
  sort_model2 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
  tree_view2 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model2);

  // Now we can sort the two models independently
  gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model1),
                                        COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_ASCENDING);
  gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model2),
                                        COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_DESCENDING);
}
```

To demonstrate how to access the underlying child model from the sort
model, the next example will be a callback for the `TreeSelection`
`TreeSelection::changed` signal. In this callback, we get a string
from COLUMN_1 of the model. We then modify the string, find the same
selected row on the child model, and change the row there.

## Accessing the child model of in a selection changed callback


```C
void
selection_changed (GtkTreeSelection *selection, gpointer data)
{
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model = NULL;
  GtkTreeModel *child_model;
  GtkTreeIter sort_iter;
  GtkTreeIter child_iter;
  char *some_data = NULL;
  char *modified_data;

  // Get the current selected row and the model.
  if (! gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (selection,
                                         &sort_model,
                                         &sort_iter))
    return;

  // Look up the current value on the selected row and get
  // a new value to change it to.
  gtk_tree_model_get (GTK_TREE_MODEL (sort_model), &sort_iter,
                      COLUMN_1, &some_data,
                      -1);

  modified_data = change_the_data (some_data);
  g_free (some_data);

  // Get an iterator on the child model, instead of the sort model.
  gtk_tree_model_sort_convert_iter_to_child_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL_SORT (sort_model),
                                                  &child_iter,
                                                  &sort_iter);

  // Get the child model and change the value of the row. In this
  // example, the child model is a GtkListStore. It could be any other
  // type of model, though.
  child_model = gtk_tree_model_sort_get_model (GTK_TREE_MODEL_SORT (sort_model));
  gtk_list_store_set (GTK_LIST_STORE (child_model), &child_iter,
                      COLUMN_1, &modified_data,
                      -1);
  g_free (modified_data);
}
```

<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn new_proxy -->
You do not need to use this function.

Creates a row reference based on `path`.

This reference will keep pointing to the node pointed to
by `path`, so long as it exists. If `path` isn’t a valid
path in `model`, then `None` is returned. However, unlike
references created with `TreeRowReference::new`, it
does not listen to the model for changes. The creator of
the row reference must do this explicitly using
`TreeRowReference::inserted`, `TreeRowReference::deleted`,
`TreeRowReference::reordered`.

These functions must be called exactly once per proxy when the
corresponding signal on the model is emitted. This single call
updates all row references for that proxy. Since built-in GTK+
objects like `TreeView` already use this mechanism internally,
using them as the proxy object will produce unpredictable results.
Further more, passing the same object as `model` and `proxy`
doesn’t work for reasons of internal implementation.

This type of row reference is primarily meant by structures that
need to carefully monitor exactly when a row reference updates
itself, and is not generally needed by most applications.

<!-- struct TreeSelection -->
The `TreeSelection` object is a helper object to manage the selection
for a `TreeView` widget. The `TreeSelection` object is
automatically created when a new `TreeView` widget is created, and
cannot exist independently of this widget. The primary reason the
`TreeSelection` objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
methods on the `TreeView` widget instead of a separate function.

The `TreeSelection` object is gotten from a `TreeView` by calling
`TreeViewExt::get_selection`. It can be manipulated to check the
selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result, multiple
views of the same model can have completely different selections.
Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
first.

One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
a view is that the `TreeSelection::changed` signal is mostly a hint.
That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
Additionally, it may on occasion emit a `TreeSelection::changed` signal
when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
select_row on an already selected row).

<!-- struct TreeSortable -->
`TreeSortable` is an interface to be implemented by tree models which
support sorting. The `TreeView` uses the methods provided by this interface
to sort the model.

# Implements

[`TreeSortableExt`](trait.TreeSortableExt.html), [`TreeModelExt`](trait.TreeModelExt.html), [`TreeSortableExtManual`](prelude/trait.TreeSortableExtManual.html)
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeSortable` methods.

<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn get_sort_column_id -->
Fills in `sort_column_id` and `order` with the current sort column and the
order. It returns `true` unless the `sort_column_id` is
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID` or
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_UNSORTED_SORT_COLUMN_ID`.
## `sort_column_id`
The sort column id to be filled in
## `order`
The `SortType` to be filled in

# Returns

`true` if the sort column is not one of the special sort
 column ids.
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn has_default_sort_func -->
Returns `true` if the model has a default sort function. This is used
primarily by `GtkTreeViewColumns` in order to determine if a model can
go back to the default state, or not.

# Returns

`true`, if the model has a default sort function
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_default_sort_func -->
Sets the default comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`.
If the current sort column id of `self` is
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, then the model will sort using
this function.

If `sort_func` is `None`, then there will be no default comparison function.
This means that once the model has been sorted, it can’t go back to the
default state. In this case, when the current sort column id of `self`
is `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, the model will be unsorted.
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the current sort column to be `sort_column_id`. The `self` will
resort itself to reflect this change, after emitting a
`TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal. `sort_column_id` may either be
a regular column id, or one of the following special values:

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: the default sort function
 will be used, if it is set

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_UNSORTED_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: no sorting will occur
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set
## `order`
The sort order of the column
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_sort_func -->
Sets the comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`. If the
current sort column id of `self` is the same as `sort_column_id`, then
the model will sort using this function.
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set the function for
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn sort_column_changed -->
Emits a `TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal on `self`.
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn connect_sort_column_changed -->
The ::sort-column-changed signal is emitted when the sort column
or sort order of `sortable` is changed. The signal is emitted before
the contents of `sortable` are resorted.
<!-- struct TreeStore -->
The `TreeStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequentially,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view. Finally,
it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk3-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

# `TreeStore` as `Buildable`

The `TreeStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a tree store:

```text
<object class="GtkTreeStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
</object>
```

<!-- trait TreeStoreExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeStore` methods.

# Implementors

[`TreeStore`](struct.TreeStore.html)
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn new -->
Creates a new tree store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_tree_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_TEXTURE);` will create a new `TreeStore` with three columns, of type
`gint`, `gchararray`, and `gdk::Texture` respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn newv -->
Non vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will append the
new row after the last child of `parent`, otherwise it will append a row to
the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from `self`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. If parent is non-`None`, then the row will be
made a child of `parent`. Otherwise, the row will be created at the toplevel.
If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows at that level, then
the new row will be inserted to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed
to point to this new row. The row will be empty after this function is
called. To fill in values, you need to call `TreeStoreExt::set` or
`TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be prepended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be appended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows on the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with
the values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values (tree_store, iter, position, ...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
gtk_tree_store_insert (tree_store, iter, position);
gtk_tree_store_set (tree_store, iter, ...);
```
with the different that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and if the tree store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`TreeStoreExt::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted tree store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing rows
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `TreeStoreExt::insert_with_values` which takes
the columns and values as two arrays, instead of varargs. This
function is mainly intended for language bindings.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last

an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn is_ancestor -->
Returns `true` if `iter` is an ancestor of `descendant`. That is, `iter` is the
parent (or grandparent or great-grandparent) of `descendant`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`
## `descendant`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true`, if `iter` is an ancestor of `descendant`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn iter_depth -->
Returns the depth of `iter`. This will be 0 for anything on the root level, 1
for anything down a level, etc.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

The depth of `iter`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn iter_is_valid -->
WARNING: This function is slow. Only use it for debugging and/or testing
purposes.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `TreeStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be moved
to the start of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be
moved to the end of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will prepend
the new row before the first child of `parent`, otherwise it will prepend a row
to the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row
will be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to
call `TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn remove -->
Removes `iter` from `self`. After being removed, `iter` is set to the
next valid row at that level, or invalidated if it previously pointed to the
last one.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is still valid, `false` if not.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn reorder -->
Reorders the children of `parent` in `self` to follow the order
indicated by `new_order`. Note that this function only works with
unsorted stores.
## `parent`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new position of each child
 to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write
`gtk_tree_store_set (store, iter, 0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from
`TreeStore`, and should only be used when constructing a new
`TreeStore`. It will not function after a row has been added,
or a method on the `TreeModel` interface is called.
## `n_columns`
Number of columns for the tree store
## `types`
An array of `glib::Type` types, one for each column
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set_valist -->
See `TreeStoreExt::set`; this version takes a va_list for
use by language bindings.

column number to modify
## `value`
new value for the cell
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set_valuesv -->
A variant of `TreeStoreExt::set_valist` which takes
the columns and values as two arrays, instead of varargs. This
function is mainly intended for language bindings or in case
the number of columns to change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays

Swaps `a` and `b` in the same level of `self`. Note that this function
only works with unsorted stores.
## `a`
A `TreeIter`.
## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct TreeView -->
Widget that displays any object that implements the `TreeModel` interface.

Please refer to the
[tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related
to the tree widget and how they work together.

Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the `TreeView` API.
These are:

![](tree-view-coordinates.png)

Coordinate systems in `TreeView` API:

- Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).

- Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that `TreeView` renders to.

- Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of `TreeView`. These
 coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.

Several functions are available for converting between the different
coordinate systems. The most common translations are between widget and bin
window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
former you can use `TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`
(and vice versa), for the latter `TreeViewExt::convert_bin_window_to_tree_coords`
(and vice versa).

# `TreeView` as `Buildable`

The `TreeView` implementation of the `Buildable` interface accepts
`TreeViewColumn` objects as `<child>` elements and exposes the internal
`TreeSelection` in UI definitions.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `TreeView`:

```plain
treeview.view
├── header
│   ├── <column header>
┊   ┊
│   ╰── <column header>
│
╰── [rubberband]
```

`TreeView` has a main CSS node with name treeview and style class .view.
It has a subnode with name header, which is the parent for all the column
header widgets' CSS nodes.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_background_area -->
Fills the bounding rectangle in bin_window coordinates for the cell at the
row specified by `path` and the column specified by `column`. If `path` is
`None`, or points to a node not found in the tree, the `y` and `height` fields of
the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The returned rectangle is equivalent to the
`background_area` passed to `gtk_cell_renderer_render`. These background

of the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The sum of all cell rects does not cover the
entire tree; there are extra pixels in between rows, for example. The
returned rectangle is equivalent to the `cell_area` passed to
`gtk_cell_renderer_render`. This function is only valid if `self` is
realized.

 filled with the current cursor path, or `None`
## `focus_column`
A
 pointer to be filled with the current focus column, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_dest_row_at_pos -->

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_path_at_pos -->
Finds the path at the point (`x`, `y`), relative to bin_window coordinates.
That is, `x` and `y` are relative to an events coordinates. Widget-relative
coordinates must be converted using
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`. It is primarily for
things like popup menus. If `path` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the `TreePath` at that point. This path should be freed with
`TreePath::free`. If `column` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the column at that point. `cell_x` and `cell_y` return the coordinates
relative to the cell background (i.e. the `background_area` passed to
`gtk_cell_renderer_render`). This function is only meaningful if
`self` is realized. Therefore this function will always return `false`
if `self` is not realized or does not have a model.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_tooltip_context -->
This function is supposed to be used in a `Widget::query-tooltip`
signal handler for `TreeView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is a tree view row at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the row returned will be the cursor row. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model. `x` and `y` will always be converted
to be relative to `self`’s bin_window if `keyboard_tooltip` is `false`.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn is_blank_at_pos -->
Determine whether the point (`x`, `y`) in `self` is blank, that is no
cell content nor an expander arrow is drawn at the location. If so, the
location can be considered as the background. You might wish to take
special action on clicks on the background, such as clearing a current
selection, having a custom context menu or starting rubber banding.

The `x` and `y` coordinate that are provided must be relative to bin_window
coordinates. Widget-relative coordinates must be converted using
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

The `path`, `column`, `cell_x` and `cell_y` arguments will be filled in
likewise as for `TreeViewExt::get_path_at_pos`. Please see

`true` if `path` is expanded.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn scroll_to_cell -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `column` and
`path`. If `column` is `None`, then no horizontal scrolling occurs. Likewise,
if `path` is `None` no vertical scrolling occurs. At a minimum, one of `column`
or `path` need to be non-`None`. `row_align` determines where the row is
placed, and `col_align` determines where `column` is placed. Both are expected
to be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means
right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the cell onto the screen.
This means that the cell will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the cell is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on the
model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the centered
path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the row to move to, or `None`.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to move horizontally to, or `None`.
## `use_align`

## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the row specified by `path`.
## `col_align`
The horizontal alignment of the column specified by `column`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn scroll_to_point -->
Scrolls the tree view such that the top-left corner of the visible
area is `tree_x`, `tree_y`, where `tree_x` and `tree_y` are specified
in tree coordinates. The `self` must be realized before
this function is called. If it isn't, you probably want to be
using `TreeViewExt::scroll_to_cell`.

If either `tree_x` or `tree_y` are -1, then that direction isn’t scrolled.
## `tree_x`
X coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
## `tree_y`
Y coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->

on a single click instead of a double click.
## `single`
`true` to emit row-activated on a single click
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_column_drag_function -->
Sets a user function for determining where a column may be dropped when
dragged. This function is called on every column pair in turn at the
beginning of a column drag to determine where a drop can take place. The
arguments passed to `func` are: the `self`, the `TreeViewColumn` being
dragged, the two `TreeViewColumn` s determining the drop spot, and
`user_data`. If either of the `TreeViewColumn` arguments for the drop spot
are `None`, then they indicate an edge. If `func` is set to be `None`, then
`self` reverts to the default behavior of allowing all columns to be
dropped everywhere.
## `func`
A function to determine which columns are reorderable, or `None`.
## `user_data`
User data to be passed to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier for `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. Additionally, if `focus_column` is specified, and `start_editing` is
`true`, then editing should be started in the specified cell.
This function is often followed by `WidgetExt::grab_focus` (`self`)
in order to give keyboard focus to the widget. Please note that editing
can only happen when the widget is realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `focus_column`
A `TreeViewColumn`, or `None`
## `start_editing`
`true` if the specified cell should start being edited.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_cursor_on_cell -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. If `focus_column` and `focus_cell` are not `None`, and `focus_column`
contains 2 or more editable or activatable cells, then focus is given to
the cell specified by `focus_cell`. Additionally, if `focus_column` is
specified, and `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be started in
the specified cell. This function is often followed by
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` (`self`) in order to give keyboard focus to the
widget. Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is
realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_enable_search -->
If `enable_search` is set, then the user can type in text to search through
the tree interactively (this is sometimes called "typeahead find").

Note that even if this is `false`, the user can still initiate a search
using the “start-interactive-search” key binding.
## `enable_search`
`true`, if the user can search interactively
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_enable_tree_lines -->

expander column to a hidden column.
## `column`
`None`, or the column to draw the expander arrow at.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_fixed_height_mode -->
Enables or disables the fixed height mode of `self`.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_level_indentation -->
Sets the amount of extra indentation for child levels to use in `self`
in addition to the default indentation. The value should be specified in
pixels, a value of 0 disables this feature and in this case only the default
indentation will be used.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `indentation`
the amount, in pixels, of extra indentation in `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `TreeView`. If the `self` already has a model
set, it will remove it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`,
then it will unset the old model.
## `model`
The model.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder
models that support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the
`TreeDragDestIface`. Both `TreeStore` and `ListStore` support
these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then the user can reorder the
model by dragging and dropping rows. The developer can listen to
these changes by connecting to the model’s `TreeModel::row-inserted`
and `TreeModel::row-deleted` signals. The reordering is implemented
by setting up the tree view as a drag source and destination.
Therefore, drag and drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any
other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the tree can be reordered.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_row_separator_func -->
Sets the row separator function, which is used to determine
whether a row should be drawn as a separator. If the row separator
function is `None`, no separators are drawn. This is the default value.
## `func`
a ``GtkTreeViewRowSeparatorFunc``
## `data`
user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_rubber_banding -->
Enables or disables rubber banding in `self`. If the selection mode
is `SelectionMode::Multiple`, rubber banding will allow the user to select
multiple rows by dragging the mouse.
## `enable`
`true` to enable rubber banding
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_column -->
Sets `column` as the column where the interactive search code should
search in for the current model.

If the search column is set, users can use the “start-interactive-search”
key binding to bring up search popup. The enable-search property controls
whether simply typing text will also start an interactive search.

Note that `column` refers to a column of the current model. The search
column is reset to -1 when the model is changed.
## `column`
the column of the model to search in, or -1 to disable searching
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_entry -->
Sets the entry which the interactive search code will use for this
`self`. This is useful when you want to provide a search entry
in our interface at all time at a fixed position. Passing `None` for
`entry` will make the interactive search code use the built-in popup
entry again.
## `entry`
the entry the interactive search code of `self` should use or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_equal_func -->
Sets the compare function for the interactive search capabilities; note
that somewhat like `strcmp` returning 0 for equality
``GtkTreeViewSearchEqualFunc`` returns `false` on matches.
## `search_equal_func`
the compare function to use during the search
## `search_user_data`
user data to pass to `search_equal_func`, or `None`
## `search_destroy`
Destroy notifier for `search_user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_position_func -->
Sets the function to use when positioning the search dialog.
## `func`
the function to use to position the search dialog, or `None`
 to use the default search position function
## `data`
user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_show_expanders -->
Sets whether to draw and enable expanders and indent child rows in
`self`. When disabled there will be no expanders visible in trees
and there will be no way to expand and collapse rows by default. Also
note that hiding the expanders will disable the default indentation. You
can set a custom indentation in this case using
`TreeViewExt::set_level_indentation`.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `enabled`
`true` to enable expander drawing, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_cell -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area `path`, `column` and `cell` have
in common. For example if `path` is `None` and `column` is set, the tip
area will be set to the full area covered by `column`. See also
`Tooltip::set_tip_area`.

Note that if `path` is not specified and `cell` is set and part of a column
containing the expander, the tooltip might not show and hide at the correct
position. In such cases `path` must be set to the current node under the
mouse cursor for this function to operate correctly.

See also `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath` or `None`
## `column`
a `TreeViewColumn` or `None`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full rows, you
can use this function to have `TreeView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_row -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the row at `path`.
See also `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn unset_rows_drag_dest -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeViewExt::enable_model_drag_dest`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn unset_rows_drag_source -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeViewExt::enable_model_drag_source`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_columns_changed -->
The number of columns of the treeview has changed.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_cursor_changed -->
The position of the cursor (focused cell) has changed.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The `TreeView::move-cursor` signal is a [keybinding
signal][`BindingSignal`] which gets emitted when the user
presses one of the cursor keys.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically. In contrast to `TreeViewExt::set_cursor` and
`TreeViewExt::set_cursor_on_cell` when moving horizontally
`TreeView::move-cursor` does not reset the current selection.
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a
`MovementStep`. `MovementStep::LogicalPositions`,
`MovementStep::VisualPositions`, `MovementStep::DisplayLines`,
`MovementStep::Pages` and `MovementStep::BufferEnds` are
supported. `MovementStep::LogicalPositions` and
`MovementStep::VisualPositions` are treated identically.
## `direction`
the direction to move: +1 to move forwards;
-1 to move backwards. The resulting movement is
undefined for all other values.

# Returns

`true` if `step` is supported, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_row_activated -->
The "row-activated" signal is emitted when the method
`TreeViewExt::row_activated` is called, when the user double
clicks a treeview row with the "activate-on-single-click"
property set to `false`, or when the user single clicks a row when
the "activate-on-single-click" property set to `true`. It is also
emitted when a non-editable row is selected and one of the keys:
Space, Shift+Space, Return or Enter is pressed.

For selection handling refer to the
[tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
as well as `TreeSelection`.
## `path`
the `TreePath` for the activated row

## `path`
a tree path that points to the row

# Returns

`false` to allow expansion, `true` to reject
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_property_activate_on_single_click -->
The activate-on-single-click property specifies whether the "row-activated" signal
will be emitted after a single click.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_property_activate_on_single_click -->
The activate-on-single-click property specifies whether the "row-activated" signal
will be emitted after a single click.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_property_fixed_height_mode -->
Setting the ::fixed-height-mode property to `true` speeds up
`TreeView` by assuming that all rows have the same height.
Only enable this option if all rows are the same height.
Please see `TreeViewExt::set_fixed_height_mode` for more
information on this option.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_property_fixed_height_mode -->
Setting the ::fixed-height-mode property to `true` speeds up
`TreeView` by assuming that all rows have the same height.

The `TreeViewColumn` object represents a visible column in a `TreeView` widget.
It allows to set properties of the column header, and functions as a holding pen for
the cell renderers which determine how the data in the column is displayed.

Please refer to the [tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related to the tree widget and how
they work together.

This is equivalent to calling `TreeViewColumnExt::set_title`,
`TreeViewColumn::pack_start`, and
`TreeViewColumn::set_attributes` on the newly created `TreeViewColumn`.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 enum { TEXT_COLUMN, COLOR_COLUMN, N_COLUMNS };
 // ...
 {
   GtkTreeViewColumn *column;
   GtkCellRenderer   *renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new ();
 
   column = gtk_tree_view_column_new_with_attributes ("Title",
                                                      renderer,
                                                      "text", TEXT_COLUMN,
                                                      "foreground", COLOR_COLUMN,

## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`. The `column` is the
column of the model to get a value from, and the `attribute` is the
parameter on `cell_renderer` to be set from the value. So for example
if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from
column 2.
## `cell_renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to set attributes on
## `attribute`
An attribute on the renderer
## `column`
The column position on the model to get the attribute from.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn cell_get_position -->

Returns `true` if any of the cells packed into the `self` are visible.
For this to be meaningful, you must first initialize the cells with
`TreeViewColumnExt::cell_set_cell_data`

# Returns

`true`, if any of the cells packed into the `self` are currently visible
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn cell_set_cell_data -->
Sets the cell renderer based on the `tree_model` and `iter`. That is, for
every attribute mapping in `self`, it will get a value from the set
column on the `iter`, and use that value to set the attribute on the cell
renderer. This is used primarily by the `TreeView`.
## `tree_model`
The `TreeModel` to to get the cell renderers attributes from.
## `iter`
The `TreeIter` to to get the cell renderer’s attributes from.
## `is_expander`

Returns the current X offset of `self` in pixels.

# Returns

The current X offset of `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to end of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then the `cell`
is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.
## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`.
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then
the `cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_attributes -->
Sets the attributes in the list as the attributes of `self`.
The attributes should be in attribute/column order, as in
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`. All existing attributes
are removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
## `cell_renderer`
the `CellRenderer` we’re setting the attributes of
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_cell_data_func -->
Sets the ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use for the column. This
function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping for
setting the column value, and should set the value of `self`'s
cell renderer as appropriate. `func` may be `None` to remove an
older one.
## `cell_renderer`
A `CellRenderer`
## `func`
The ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use.
## `func_data`
The user data for `func`.
## `destroy`
The destroy notification for `func_data`
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_clickable -->
Sets the header to be active if `clickable` is `true`. When the header is
active, then it can take keyboard focus, and can be clicked.
## `clickable`
`true` if the header is active.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_expand -->
Sets the column to take available extra space. This space is shared equally
amongst all columns that have the expand set to `true`. If no column has this
option set, then the last column gets all extra space. By default, every
column is created with this `false`.

Along with “fixed-width”, the “expand” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `expand`
`true` if the column should expand to fill available space.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_fixed_width -->
If `fixed_width` is not -1, sets the fixed width of `self`; otherwise
unsets it. The effective value of `fixed_width` is clamped between the
minimum and maximum width of the column; however, the value stored in the
“fixed-width” property is not clamped. If the column sizing is
`TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly` or `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, setting
a fixed width overrides the automatically calculated width. Note that
`fixed_width` is only a hint to GTK+; the width actually allocated to the
column may be greater or less than requested.

Along with “expand”, the “fixed-width” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `fixed_width`
The new fixed width, in pixels, or -1.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_max_width -->
Sets the maximum width of the `self`. If `max_width` is -1, then the
maximum width is unset. Note, the column can actually be wider than max
width if it’s the last column in a view. In this case, the column expands to
fill any extra space.
## `max_width`
The maximum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_min_width -->
Sets the minimum width of the `self`. If `min_width` is -1, then the
minimum width is unset.
## `min_width`
The minimum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_reorderable -->
If `reorderable` is `true`, then the column can be reordered by the end user
dragging the header.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the column can be reordered.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_resizable -->
If `resizable` is `true`, then the user can explicitly resize the column by
grabbing the outer edge of the column button. If resizable is `true` and
sizing mode of the column is `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, then the sizing
mode is changed to `TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly`.
## `resizable`
`true`, if the column can be resized
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_sizing -->
Sets the growth behavior of `self` to `type_`.
## `type_`
The `TreeViewColumnSizing`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the logical `sort_column_id` that this column sorts on when this column
is selected for sorting. Doing so makes the column header clickable.
## `sort_column_id`
The `sort_column_id` of the model to sort on.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_sort_indicator -->
Call this function with a `setting` of `true` to display an arrow in
the header button indicating the column is sorted. Call
`TreeViewColumnExt::set_sort_order` to change the direction of
the arrow.
## `setting`
`true` to display an indicator that the column is sorted
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_sort_order -->
Changes the appearance of the sort indicator.

This does not actually sort the model. Use
`TreeViewColumnExt::set_sort_column_id` if you want automatic sorting
support. This function is primarily for custom sorting behavior, and should
be used in conjunction with `TreeSortable::set_sort_column_id` to do
that. For custom models, the mechanism will vary.

The sort indicator changes direction to indicate normal sort or reverse sort.
Note that you must have the sort indicator enabled to see anything when
calling this function; see `TreeViewColumnExt::set_sort_indicator`.
## `order`
sort order that the sort indicator should indicate
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_spacing -->
Sets the spacing field of `self`, which is the number of pixels to
place between cell renderers packed into it.
## `spacing`
distance between cell renderers in pixels.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `self`. If a custom widget has been set, then
this value is ignored.
## `title`
The title of the `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility of `self`.
## `visible`
`true` if the `self` is visible.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_widget -->
Sets the widget in the header to be `widget`. If widget is `None`, then the
header button is set with a `Label` set to the title of `self`.
## `widget`
A child `Widget`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn get_property_cell_area -->
The `CellArea` used to layout cell renderers for this column.

If no area is specified when creating the tree view column with `TreeViewColumn::new_with_area`
a horizontally oriented `CellAreaBox` will be used.
<!-- trait TreeViewColumnExt::fn set_property_cell_area -->
The `CellArea` used to layout cell renderers for this column.

If no area is specified when creating the tree view column with `TreeViewColumn::new_with_area`
a horizontally oriented `CellAreaBox` will be used.

<!-- struct Viewport -->
The `Viewport` widget acts as an adaptor class, implementing
scrollability for child widgets that lack their own scrolling
capabilities. Use `Viewport` to scroll child widgets such as
`Grid`, `Box`, and so on.

If a widget has native scrolling abilities, such as `TextView`,
`TreeView` or `IconView`, it can be added to a `ScrolledWindow`
with `ContainerExt::add`. If a widget does not, you must first add the
widget to a `Viewport`, then add the viewport to the scrolled window.
`ContainerExt::add` does this automatically if a child that does not
implement `Scrollable` is added to a `ScrolledWindow`, so you can
ignore the presence of the viewport.

The `Viewport` will start scrolling content only if allocated less
than the child widget’s minimum size in a given orientation.

# CSS nodes

`Viewport` has a single CSS node with name viewport.

<!-- struct Widget -->
`Widget` is the base class all widgets in GTK+ derive from. It manages the
widget lifecycle, states and style.

# Height-for-width Geometry Management # {`geometry`-management}

GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.

Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
of two virtual methods:

- `WidgetClass.get_request_mode`()
- `WidgetClass.measure`()

There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
height-for-width and when using it in widget implementations.

If you implement a direct `Widget` subclass that supports
height-for-width or width-for-height geometry management for
itself or its child widgets, the `WidgetClass.get_request_mode`()
virtual function must be implemented as well and return the widget's
preferred request mode. The default implementation of this virtual function
returns `SizeRequestMode::ConstantSize`, which means that the widget will only ever
get -1 passed as the for_size value to its `WidgetClass.measure`() implementation.

The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
in the `SizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.

For example, when queried in the normal
`SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` mode:
First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
in the interface will be computed using `WidgetExt::measure` with an orientation
of `Orientation::Horizontal` and a for_size of -1.
Because the preferred widths for each widget depend on the preferred
widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
minimum height contextual to that width using `WidgetExt::measure` with an
orientation of `Orientation::Vertical` and a for_size of the just computed
width. This will also be a highly recursive operation.
The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
(unless `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints` is explicitly used instead).

After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
previously specified with `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size`). During the
recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
will be recursively executed while widgets allocate their children.
Each widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
depending. In this way a `Widget` will typically be requested its size
a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
requested. For this reason, `Widget` caches a small number of results
to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.

If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
allocated size then it must support the request in both
``GtkSizeRequestModes`` even if the widget in question only
trades sizes in a single orientation.

For instance, a `Label` that does height-for-width word wrapping
will not expect to have `WidgetClass.measure`() with an orientation of
`Orientation::Vertical` called because that call is specific to a
width-for-height request. In this
case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
at least enough space to fit its own content.

Here are some examples of how a `SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` widget
generally deals with width-for-height requests:


```C
static void
foo_widget_measure (GtkWidget      *widget,
                    GtkOrientation  orientation,
                    int             for_size,
                    int            *minimum_size,
                    int            *natural_size,
                    int            *minimum_baseline,
                    int            *natural_baseline)
{
  if (orientation == GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL)
    {
      // Calculate minimum and natural width
    }
  else // VERTICAL
    {
       if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
         {
           int min_width, dummy;

           // First, get the minimum width of our widget
           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, -1,
                                                   &min_width, &dummy, &dummy, &dummy);

           // Now use the minimum width to retrieve the minimum and natural height to display
           // that width.
           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, min_width,
                                                   minimum_size, natural_size, &dummy, &dummy);
         }
       else
         {
           // ... some widgets do both.
         }
   }
}
```

Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like in the code
example above.

It will not work to use the wrapper function `WidgetExt::measure`
inside your own `WidgetClass.size-allocate`() implementation.
These return a request adjusted by `SizeGroup`, the widget's align and expand flags
as well as its CSS style.
If a widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
to do it.

Of course if you are getting the size request for
another widget, such as a child widget, you must use `WidgetExt::measure`.
Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
`SizeGroup`, and so forth.

GTK+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
has a vertical alignment of `Align::Baseline`, and is inside a widget
that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.

Baseline alignment support for a widget is also done by the `WidgetClass.measure`()
virtual function. It allows you to report a both a minimum and natural

If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
as if it was `Align::Fill`, but the selected baseline can be found via `WidgetExt::get_allocated_baseline`.
If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
appears at the position.

# `Widget` as `Buildable`

The `Widget` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<accelerator>` element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:

```C
static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...

  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
}
```

You will also need to call `WidgetExt::init_template` from the instance
initialization function:


```C
static void
foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
}
```

You can access widgets defined in the template using the
`WidgetExt::get_template_child` function, but you will typically declare
a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
name as the widget in the template definition, and call
`gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private` with that name, e.g.


```C
typedef struct {
  GtkWidget *hello_button;
  GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
} FooWidgetPrivate;

G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, hello_button);
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, goodbye_button);
}

static void
foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
{

}
```

You can also use `gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback` to connect a signal
callback defined in the template with a function visible in the scope of the
class, e.g.


```C
// the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
// because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
static void
hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
                      GtkButton *button)
{
  g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
}

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);
}
```

<!-- impl Widget::fn new -->
This is a convenience function for creating a widget and setting
its properties in one go. For example you might write:
`gtk_widget_new (GTK_TYPE_LABEL, "label", "Hello World", "xalign",
0.0, NULL)` to create a left-aligned label. Equivalent to
`gobject::Object::new`, but returns a widget so you don’t have to
cast the object yourself.
## `type_`
type ID of the widget to create
## `first_property_name`
name of first property to set

# Returns

a new `Widget` of type `widget_type`
<!-- impl Widget::fn get_default_direction -->
Obtains the current default reading direction. See
`Widget::set_default_direction`.

# Returns

the current default direction.
<!-- impl Widget::fn set_default_direction -->
Sets the default reading direction for widgets where the
direction has not been explicitly set by `WidgetExt::set_direction`.
## `dir`
the new default direction. This cannot be
 `TextDirection::None`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate -->
For widgets that can be “activated” (buttons, menu items, etc.)
this function activates them. Activation is what happens when you
press Enter on a widget during key navigation. If `self` isn't
activatable, the function returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget was activatable
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate_action -->
Looks up the action in the action groups associated
with `self` and its ancestors, and activates it.

The action name is expected to be prefixed with the
prefix that was used when adding the action group
with `WidgetExt::insert_action_group`.

The `parameter` must match the actions expected parameter
type, as returned by `gio::Action::get_parameter_type`.
## `name`
a prefixed action name
## `parameter`
parameters that required by the action
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate_default -->
Activate the default.activate action from `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_accelerator -->
Installs an accelerator for this `self` in `accel_group` that causes
`accel_signal` to be emitted if the accelerator is activated.
The `accel_group` needs to be added to the widget’s toplevel via
`GtkWindowExt::add_accel_group`, and the signal must be of type `gobject::SignalFlags::Action`.
Accelerators added through this function are not user changeable during
runtime. If you want to support accelerators that can be changed by the
user, use `AccelMap::add_entry` and `WidgetExt::set_accel_path` or
`GtkMenuItemExt::set_accel_path` instead.
## `accel_signal`
widget signal to emit on accelerator activation
## `accel_group`
accel group for this widget, added to its toplevel
## `accel_key`
GDK keyval of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier key combination of the accelerator
## `accel_flags`
flag accelerators, e.g. `AccelFlags::Visible`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_controller -->
Adds `controller` to `self` so that it will receive events. You will
usually want to call this function right after creating any kind of
`EventController`.
## `controller`
a `EventController` that hasn't been
 added to a widget yet
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_mnemonic_label -->
Adds a widget to the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). Note the
list of mnemonic labels for the widget is cleared when the
widget is destroyed, so the caller must make sure to update
its internal state at this point as well, by using a connection
to the `Widget::destroy` signal or a weak notifier.
## `label`
a `Widget` that acts as a mnemonic label for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExtManual::fn add_tick_callback -->
Queues an animation frame update and adds a callback to be called
before each frame. Until the tick callback is removed, it will be
called frequently (usually at the frame rate of the output device
or as quickly as the application can be repainted, whichever is
slower). For this reason, is most suitable for handling graphics
that change every frame or every few frames. The tick callback does
not automatically imply a relayout or repaint. If you want a
repaint or relayout, and aren’t changing widget properties that
would trigger that (for example, changing the text of a `Label`),
then you will have to call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` or
`WidgetExt::queue_draw` yourself.

`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` should generally be used for timing
continuous animations and
`gdk::FrameTimings::get_predicted_presentation_time` if you are
trying to display isolated frames at particular times.

This is a more convenient alternative to connecting directly to the
`gdk::FrameClock::update` signal of `gdk::FrameClock`, since you don't
have to worry about when a `gdk::FrameClock` is assigned to a widget.
## `callback`
function to call for updating animations
## `user_data`
data to pass to `callback`
## `notify`
function to call to free `user_data` when the callback is removed.

# Returns

an id for the connection of this callback. Remove the callback
 by passing the id returned from this function to
 `Widget::remove_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn allocate -->
This function is only used by `Widget` subclasses, to assign a size,
position and (optionally) baseline to their child widgets.

In this function, the allocation and baseline may be adjusted. The given
allocation will be forced to be bigger than the widget's minimum size,
as well as at least 0×0 in size.

For a version that does not take a transform, see `WidgetExt::size_allocate`
## `width`
New width of `self`
## `height`
New height of `self`
## `baseline`
New baseline of `self`, or -1
## `transform`
Transformation to be applied to `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn can_activate_accel -->
Determines whether an accelerator that activates the signal
identified by `signal_id` can currently be activated.
This is done by emitting the `Widget::can-activate-accel`
signal on `self`; if the signal isn’t overridden by a
handler or in a derived widget, then the default check is
that the widget must be sensitive, and the widget and all
its ancestors mapped.
## `signal_id`
the ID of a signal installed on `self`

# Returns

`true` if the accelerator can be activated.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn child_focus -->
This function is used by custom widget implementations; if you're
writing an app, you’d use `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to move the focus
to a particular widget.

`WidgetExt::child_focus` is called by containers as the user moves
around the window using keyboard shortcuts. `direction` indicates
what kind of motion is taking place (up, down, left, right, tab
forward, tab backward). `WidgetExt::child_focus` emits the
`Widget::focus` signal; widgets override the default handler
for this signal in order to implement appropriate focus behavior.

The default ::focus handler for a widget should return `true` if
moving in `direction` left the focus on a focusable location inside
that widget, and `false` if moving in `direction` moved the focus
outside the widget. If returning `true`, widgets normally
call `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to place the focus accordingly;
if returning `false`, they don’t modify the current focus location.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if focus ended up inside `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_bounds -->
Computes the bounds for `self` in the coordinate space of `target`.
FIXME: Explain what "bounds" are.

If the operation is successful, `true` is returned. If `self` has no
bounds or the bounds cannot be expressed in `target`'s coordinate space
(for example if both widgets are in different windows), `false` is
returned and `bounds` is set to the zero rectangle.

It is valid for `self` and `target` to be the same widget.
## `target`
the `Widget`
## `out_bounds`
the rectangle taking the bounds

# Returns

`true` if the bounds could be computed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_expand -->
Computes whether a container should give this widget extra space
when possible. Containers should check this, rather than
looking at `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` or `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`.

This function already checks whether the widget is visible, so
visibility does not need to be checked separately. Non-visible
widgets are not expanded.

The computed expand value uses either the expand setting explicitly
set on the widget itself, or, if none has been explicitly set,
the widget may expand if some of its children do.
## `orientation`
expand direction

# Returns

whether widget tree rooted here should be expanded
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_point -->
Translates the given `point` in `self`'s coordinates to coordinates
relative to `target`’s coodinate system. In order to perform this
operation, both widgets must share a common ancestor.
## `target`
the `Widget` to transform into
## `point`
a point in `self`'s coordinate system
## `out_point`
Set to the corresponding coordinates in
 `target`'s coordinate system

# Returns

`true` if the point could be determined, `false` on failure.
 In this case, 0 is stored in `out_point`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_transform -->
Computes a matrix suitable to describe a transformation from
`self`'s coordinate system into `target`'s coordinate system.
## `target`
the target widget that the matrix will transform to
## `out_transform`
location to
 store the final transformation

# Returns

`true` if the transform could be computed, `false` otherwise.
 The transform can not be computed in certain cases, for example when
 `self` and `target` do not share a common ancestor. In that
 case `out_transform` gets set to the identity matrix.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn contains -->
Tests if the point at (`x`, `y`) is contained in `self`.

The coordinates for (`x`, `y`) must be in widget coordinates, so
(0, 0) is assumed to be the top left of `self`'s content area.
## `x`
X coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `y`
Y coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin

# Returns

`true` if `self` contains (`x`, `y`).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_context -->
Creates a new `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map,
font options, font description, and base direction for drawing
text for this widget. See also `WidgetExt::get_pango_context`.

# Returns

the new `pango::Context`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_layout -->
Creates a new `pango::Layout` with the appropriate font map,
font description, and base direction for drawing text for
this widget.

If you keep a `pango::Layout` created in this way around, you need
to re-create it when the widget `pango::Context` is replaced.
This can be tracked by using the `Widget::display-changed` signal
on the widget.
## `text`
text to set on the layout (can be `None`)

# Returns

the new `pango::Layout`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn destroy -->
Destroys a widget.

When a widget is destroyed all references it holds on other objects
will be released:

 - if the widget is inside a container, it will be removed from its
 parent
 - if the widget is a container, all its children will be destroyed,
 recursively
 - if the widget is a top level, it will be removed from the list
 of top level widgets that GTK+ maintains internally

It's expected that all references held on the widget will also
be released; you should connect to the `Widget::destroy` signal
if you hold a reference to `self` and you wish to remove it when
this function is called. It is not necessary to do so if you are
implementing a `Container`, as you'll be able to use the
`ContainerClass.remove`() virtual function for that.

It's important to notice that `WidgetExt::destroy` will only cause
the `self` to be finalized if no additional references, acquired
using `gobject::ObjectExt::ref`, are held on it. In case additional references
are in place, the `self` will be in an "inert" state after calling
this function; `self` will still point to valid memory, allowing you
to release the references you hold, but you may not query the widget's
own state.

You should typically call this function on top level widgets, and
rarely on child widgets.

See also: `ContainerExt::remove`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn destroyed -->
This function sets *`widget_pointer` to `None` if `widget_pointer` !=
`None`. It’s intended to be used as a callback connected to the
“destroy” signal of a widget. You connect `WidgetExt::destroyed`
as a signal handler, and pass the address of your widget variable
as user data. Then when the widget is destroyed, the variable will
be set to `None`. Useful for example to avoid multiple copies
of the same dialog.
## `widget_pointer`
address of a variable that contains `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn device_is_shadowed -->
Returns `true` if `device` has been shadowed by a GTK+
device grab on another widget, so it would stop sending
events to `self`. This may be used in the
`Widget::grab-notify` signal to check for specific
devices. See `gtk_device_grab_add`.
## `device`
a `gdk::Device`

# Returns

`true` if there is an ongoing grab on `device`
 by another `Widget` than `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_begin -->
Initiates a drag on the source side. The function only needs to be used
when the application is starting drags itself, and is not needed when
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set` is used.
## `device`
the device that starts the drag or `None` to use the default pointer
## `targets`
The targets (data formats) in which the source can provide the data
## `actions`
A bitmask of the allowed drag actions for this drag
## `x`
The initial x coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate space of `self`.
## `y`
The initial y coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate space of `self`.

# Returns

the context for this drag
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_check_threshold -->
Checks to see if a mouse drag starting at (`start_x`, `start_y`) and ending
at (`current_x`, `current_y`) has passed the GTK+ drag threshold, and thus
should trigger the beginning of a drag-and-drop operation.
## `start_x`
X coordinate of start of drag
## `start_y`
Y coordinate of start of drag
## `current_x`
current X coordinate
## `current_y`
current Y coordinate

# Returns

`true` if the drag threshold has been passed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_image_targets -->
Add the image targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_target_list_add_image_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_text_targets -->
Add the text targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_target_list_add_text_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_add_uri_targets -->
Add the URI targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag destination. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_target_list_add_uri_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_find_target -->
Looks for a match between the supported targets of `drop` and the
`dest_target_list`, returning the first matching target, otherwise
returning `None`. `dest_target_list` should usually be the return
value from `WidgetExt::drag_dest_get_target_list`, but some widgets may
have different valid targets for different parts of the widget; in
that case, they will have to implement a drag_motion handler that
passes the correct target list to this function.
## `drop`
`gdk::Drop`
## `target_list`
list of droppable targets, or `None` to use
 gtk_drag_dest_get_target_list (`self`).

# Returns

first target that the source offers
 and the dest can accept, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_get_target_list -->
Returns the list of targets this widget can accept from
drag-and-drop.

# Returns

the `gdk::ContentFormats`, or `None` if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_get_track_motion -->
Returns whether the widget has been configured to always
emit `Widget::drag-motion` signals.

# Returns

`true` if the widget always emits
 `Widget::drag-motion` events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set -->
Sets a widget as a potential drop destination, and adds default behaviors.

The default behaviors listed in `flags` have an effect similar
to installing default handlers for the widget’s drag-and-drop signals
(`Widget::drag-motion`, `Widget::drag-drop`, ...). They all exist
for convenience. When passing `DestDefaults::All` for instance it is
sufficient to connect to the widget’s `Widget::drag-data-received`
signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.

Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
as described in the documentation for `Widget::drag-motion`. The default
behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
with your own signal handlers. For instance `DestDefaults::Drop` causes
invokations of `gdk_drag_status` in the context of `Widget::drag-motion`,
and invokations of `gdk_drag_finish` in `Widget::drag-data-received`.
Especially the later is dramatic, when your own `Widget::drag-motion`
handler calls `WidgetExt::drag_get_data` to inspect the dragged data.

There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
`Widget::drag-motion` callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:

```C
static void
drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
             GdkDrag *drag,
             gint x,
             gint y,
             guint time)
{
  GdkModifierType mask;

  gdk_surface_get_pointer (gtk_widget_get_surface (widget),
                          NULL, NULL, &mask);
  if (mask & GDK_CONTROL_MASK)
    gdk_drag_status (context, GDK_ACTION_COPY, time);
  else
    gdk_drag_status (context, GDK_ACTION_MOVE, time);
}
```
## `flags`
which types of default drag behavior to use
## `targets`
the drop types that this `self` will
 accept, or `None`. Later you can access the list with
 `WidgetExt::drag_dest_get_target_list` and `WidgetExt::drag_dest_find_target`.
## `actions`
a bitmask of possible actions for a drop onto this `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set_target_list -->
Sets the target types that this widget can accept from drag-and-drop.
The widget must first be made into a drag destination with
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set`.
## `target_list`
list of droppable targets, or `None` for none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_set_track_motion -->
Tells the widget to emit `Widget::drag-motion` and
`Widget::drag-leave` events regardless of the targets and the
`DestDefaults::Motion` flag.

This may be used when a widget wants to do generic
actions regardless of the targets that the source offers.
## `track_motion`
whether to accept all targets
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_dest_unset -->
Clears information about a drop destination set with
`WidgetExt::drag_dest_set`. The widget will no longer receive
notification of drags.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_get_data -->
Gets the data associated with a drag. When the data
is received or the retrieval fails, GTK+ will emit a
`Widget::drag-data-received` signal. Failure of the retrieval
is indicated by the length field of the `selection_data`
signal parameter being negative. However, when `WidgetExt::drag_get_data`
is called implicitely because the `DestDefaults::Drop` was set,
then the widget will not receive notification of failed
drops.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `target`
the target (form of the data) to retrieve
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_highlight -->
Highlights a widget as a currently hovered drop target.
To end the highlight, call `WidgetExt::drag_unhighlight`.
GTK+ calls this automatically if `DestDefaults::Highlight` is set.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_image_targets -->
Add the writable image targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_target_list_add_image_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_text_targets -->
Add the text targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_content_formats_add_text_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_add_uri_targets -->
Add the URI targets supported by `SelectionData` to
the target list of the drag source. The targets
are added with `info` = 0. If you need another value,
use `gtk_content_formats_add_uri_targets` and
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set_target_list`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_get_target_list -->
Gets the list of targets this widget can provide for
drag-and-drop.

# Returns

the `gdk::ContentFormats`, or `None` if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set -->
Sets up a widget so that GTK+ will start a drag operation when the user
clicks and drags on the widget. The widget must have a window.
## `start_button_mask`
the bitmask of buttons that can start the drag
## `targets`
the targets that the drag will support,
 may be `None`
## `actions`
the bitmask of possible actions for a drag from this widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_gicon -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to `icon`. See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
## `icon`
A `gio::Icon`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_name -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to a themed icon. See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
## `icon_name`
name of icon to use
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_icon_paintable -->
Sets the icon that will be used for drags from a particular source
to `paintable`.
## `paintable`
A `gdk::Paintable`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_set_target_list -->
Changes the target types that this widget offers for drag-and-drop.
The widget must first be made into a drag source with
`WidgetExt::drag_source_set`.
## `target_list`
list of draggable targets, or `None` for none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_source_unset -->
Undoes the effects of `WidgetExt::drag_source_set`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_unhighlight -->
Removes a highlight set by `WidgetExt::drag_highlight` from
a widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn error_bell -->
Notifies the user about an input-related error on this widget.
If the `Settings:gtk-error-bell` setting is `true`, it calls
`gdk::SurfaceExt::beep`, otherwise it does nothing.

Note that the effect of `gdk::SurfaceExt::beep` can be configured in many
ways, depending on the windowing backend and the desktop environment
or window manager that is used.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn event -->
Rarely-used function. This function is used to emit
the event signals on a widget (those signals should never
be emitted without using this function to do so).
If you want to synthesize an event though, don’t use this function;
instead, use `gtk_main_do_event` so the event will behave as if
it were in the event queue.
## `event`
a `gdk::Event`

# Returns

return from the event signal emission (`true` if
 the event was handled)
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_accessible -->
Returns the accessible object that describes the widget to an
assistive technology.

If accessibility support is not available, this `atk::Object`
instance may be a no-op. Likewise, if no class-specific `atk::Object`
implementation is available for the widget instance in question,
it will inherit an `atk::Object` implementation from the first ancestor
class for which such an implementation is defined.

The documentation of the
[ATK](http://developer.gnome.org/atk/stable/)
library contains more information about accessible objects and their uses.

# Returns

the `atk::Object` associated with `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_action_group -->
Retrieves the `gio::ActionGroup` that was registered using `prefix`. The resulting
`gio::ActionGroup` may have been registered to `self` or any `Widget` in its
ancestry.

If no action group was found matching `prefix`, then `None` is returned.
## `prefix`
The “prefix” of the action group.

# Returns

A `gio::ActionGroup` or `None`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_baseline -->
Returns the baseline that has currently been allocated to `self`.
This function is intended to be used when implementing handlers
for the `Widget::snapshot` function, and when allocating child
widgets in `Widget::size_allocate`.

# Returns

the baseline of the `self`, or -1 if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_height -->
Returns the height that has currently been allocated to `self`.

# Returns

the height of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_width -->
Returns the width that has currently been allocated to `self`.

# Returns

the width of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocation -->
Retrieves the widget’s allocation.

Note, when implementing a `Container`: a widget’s allocation will
be its “adjusted” allocation, that is, the widget’s parent
container typically calls `WidgetExt::size_allocate` with an
allocation, and that allocation is then adjusted (to handle margin
and alignment for example) before assignment to the widget.
`WidgetExt::get_allocation` returns the adjusted allocation that
was actually assigned to the widget. The adjusted allocation is
guaranteed to be completely contained within the
`WidgetExt::size_allocate` allocation, however. So a `Container`
is guaranteed that its children stay inside the assigned bounds,
but not that they have exactly the bounds the container assigned.
## `allocation`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_ancestor -->
Gets the first ancestor of `self` with type `widget_type`. For example,
`gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)` gets
the first `Box` that’s an ancestor of `self`. No reference will be
added to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced. See note
about checking for a toplevel `Window` in the docs for
`WidgetExt::get_toplevel`.

Note that unlike `WidgetExt::is_ancestor`, `WidgetExt::get_ancestor`
considers `self` to be an ancestor of itself.
## `widget_type`
ancestor type

# Returns

the ancestor widget, or `None` if not found
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_focus -->
Determines whether `self` can own the input focus. See
`WidgetExt::set_can_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can own the input focus, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_target -->
Queries whether `self` can be the target of pointer events.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can receive pointer events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_child_visible -->
Gets the value set with `WidgetExt::set_child_visible`.
If you feel a need to use this function, your code probably
needs reorganization.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped with the parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_clipboard -->
This is a utility function to get the clipboard object for the
`gdk::Display` that `self` is using.

Note that this function always works, even when `self` is not
realized yet.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_cursor -->
Queries the cursor set via `WidgetExt::set_cursor`. See that function for
details.

# Returns

the cursor currently in use or `None`
 to use the default.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_direction -->
Gets the reading direction for a particular widget. See
`WidgetExt::set_direction`.

# Returns

the reading direction for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_display -->
Get the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel window associated with
this widget. This function can only be called after the widget
has been added to a widget hierarchy with a `Window` at the top.

In general, you should only create display specific
resources when a widget has been realized, and you should
free those resources when the widget is unrealized.

# Returns

the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_first_child -->

# Returns

The widget's first child
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_focus_child -->
Returns the current focus child of `self`.

# Returns

The current focus child of `self`,
 or `None` in case the focus child is unset.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_focus_on_click -->
Returns whether the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with the mouse.
See `WidgetExt::set_focus_on_click`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with
 the mouse.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_font_map -->
Gets the font map that has been set with `WidgetExt::set_font_map`.

# Returns

A `pango::FontMap`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_font_options -->
Returns the `cairo::FontOptions` used for Pango rendering. When not set,
the defaults font options for the `gdk::Display` will be used.

# Returns

the `cairo::FontOptions` or `None` if not set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_frame_clock -->
Obtains the frame clock for a widget. The frame clock is a global
“ticker” that can be used to drive animations and repaints. The
most common reason to get the frame clock is to call
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, in order to get a time to use for
animating. For example you might record the start of the animation
with an initial value from `gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, and
then update the animation by calling
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` again during each repaint.

`gdk::FrameClock::request_phase` will result in a new frame on the
clock, but won’t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint a
widget, you have to use `WidgetExt::queue_draw` which invalidates
the widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the next
frame). `WidgetExt::queue_draw` will also end up requesting a frame
on the appropriate frame clock.

A widget’s frame clock will not change while the widget is
mapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) can
change the widget’s frame clock.

Unrealized widgets do not have a frame clock.

# Returns

a `gdk::FrameClock`,
or `None` if widget is unrealized
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_halign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:halign` property.

For backwards compatibility reasons this method will never return
`Align::Baseline`, but instead it will convert it to
`Align::Fill`. Baselines are not supported for horizontal
alignment.

# Returns

the horizontal alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_has_surface -->
Determines whether `self` has a `gdk::Surface` of its own. See
`WidgetExt::set_has_surface`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has a surface, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_has_tooltip -->
Returns the current value of the has-tooltip property. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.

# Returns

current value of has-tooltip on `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_height -->
Returns the content height of the widget, as passed to its size-allocate implementation.
This is the size you should be using in `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`. For pointer
events, see `WidgetExt::contains`.

# Returns

The height of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Containers should use `WidgetExt::compute_expand` rather than
this function, to see whether a widget, or any of its children,
has the expand flag set. If any child of a widget wants to
expand, the parent may ask to expand also.

This function only looks at the widget’s own hexpand flag, rather
than computing whether the entire widget tree rooted at this widget
wants to expand.

# Returns

whether hexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.

# Returns

whether hexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_last_child -->

# Returns

The widget's last child
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_layout_manager -->
Retrieves the layout manager set using `WidgetExt::set_layout_manager`.

# Returns

a `LayoutManager`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_mapped -->
Whether the widget is mapped.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_bottom -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.

# Returns

The bottom margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_end -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-end` property.

# Returns

The end margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_start -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-start` property.

# Returns

The start margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_top -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-top` property.

# Returns

The top margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_modifier_mask -->
Returns the modifier mask the `self`’s windowing system backend
uses for a particular purpose.

See `gdk::Keymap::get_modifier_mask`.
## `intent`
the use case for the modifier mask

# Returns

the modifier mask used for `intent`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_name -->
Retrieves the name of a widget. See `Widget::set_name` for the
significance of widget names.

# Returns

name of the widget. This string is owned by GTK+ and
should not be modified or freed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_next_sibling -->

# Returns

The widget's next sibling
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_opacity -->
Fetches the requested opacity for this widget.
See `WidgetExt::set_opacity`.

# Returns

the requested opacity for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_overflow -->
Returns the value set via `WidgetExt::set_overflow`.

# Returns

The widget's overflow.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_pango_context -->
Gets a `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map, font description,
and base direction for this widget. Unlike the context returned
by `WidgetExt::create_pango_context`, this context is owned by
the widget (it can be used until the screen for the widget changes
or the widget is removed from its toplevel), and will be updated to
match any changes to the widget’s attributes. This can be tracked
by using the `Widget::display-changed` signal on the widget.

# Returns

the `pango::Context` for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_parent -->
Returns the parent widget of `self`.

# Returns

the parent widget of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_path -->
Returns the `WidgetPath` representing `self`, if the widget
is not connected to a toplevel widget, a partial path will be
created.

# Returns

The `WidgetPath` representing `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_size -->
Retrieves the minimum and natural size of a widget, taking
into account the widget’s preference for height-for-width management.

This is used to retrieve a suitable size by container widgets which do
not impose any restrictions on the child placement. It can be used
to deduce toplevel window and menu sizes as well as child widgets in
free-form containers such as `GtkLayout`.

Handle with care. Note that the natural height of a height-for-width
widget will generally be a smaller size than the minimum height, since the required
height for the natural width is generally smaller than the required height for
the minimum width.

Use `WidgetExt::measure` if you want to support
baseline alignment.
## `minimum_size`
location for storing the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_size`
location for storing the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_prev_sibling -->

# Returns

The widget's previous sibling
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_primary_clipboard -->
This is a utility function to get the primary clipboard object
for the `gdk::Display` that `self` is using.

Note that this function always works, even when `self` is not
realized yet.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_realized -->
Determines whether `self` is realized.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is realized, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_receives_default -->
Determines whether `self` is always treated as the default widget
within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if another widget
is the default.

See `WidgetExt::set_receives_default`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` acts as the default widget when focused,
 `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_request_mode -->
Gets whether the widget prefers a height-for-width layout
or a width-for-height layout.

`Bin` widgets generally propagate the preference of
their child, container widgets need to request something either in
context of their children or in context of their allocation
capabilities.

# Returns

The `SizeRequestMode` preferred by `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_root -->
Returns the `Root` widget of `self` or `None` if the widget is not contained
inside a widget tree with a root widget.

`Root` widgets will return themselves here.

# Returns

the root widget of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_scale_factor -->
Retrieves the internal scale factor that maps from window coordinates
to the actual device pixels. On traditional systems this is 1, on
high density outputs, it can be a higher value (typically 2).

See `gdk::SurfaceExt::get_scale_factor`.

# Returns

the scale factor for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s sensitivity (in the sense of returning
the value that has been set using `WidgetExt::set_sensitive`).

The effective sensitivity of a widget is however determined by both its
own and its parent widget’s sensitivity. See `WidgetExt::is_sensitive`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_settings -->
Gets the settings object holding the settings used for this widget.

Note that this function can only be called when the `Widget`
is attached to a toplevel, since the settings object is specific
to a particular `gdk::Display`.

# Returns

the relevant `Settings` object
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_size_request -->
Gets the size request that was explicitly set for the widget using
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. A value of -1 stored in `width` or
`height` indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitly
and the natural requisition of the widget will be used instead. See
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. To get the size a widget will
actually request, call `WidgetExt::measure` instead of
this function.
## `width`
return location for width, or `None`
## `height`
return location for height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_state_flags -->
Returns the widget state as a flag set. It is worth mentioning
that the effective `StateFlags::Insensitive` state will be
returned, that is, also based on parent insensitivity, even if
`self` itself is sensitive.

Also note that if you are looking for a way to obtain the
`StateFlags` to pass to a `StyleContext` method, you
should look at `StyleContextExt::get_state`.

# Returns

The state flags for widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_style_context -->
Returns the style context associated to `self`. The returned object is
guaranteed to be the same for the lifetime of `self`.

# Returns

a `StyleContext`. This memory is owned by `self` and
 must not be freed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_support_multidevice -->
Returns `true` if `self` is multiple pointer aware. See
`WidgetExt::set_support_multidevice` for more information.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is multidevice aware.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_surface -->
Returns the widget’s surface if it is realized, `None` otherwise

# Returns

`self`’s surface.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_template_child -->
Fetch an object build from the template XML for `widget_type` in this `self` instance.

This will only report children which were previously declared with
`WidgetClass::bind_template_child_full` or one of its
variants.

This function is only meant to be called for code which is private to the `widget_type` which
declared the child and is meant for language bindings which cannot easily make use
of the GObject structure offsets.
## `widget_type`
The `glib::Type` to get a template child for
## `name`
The “id” of the child defined in the template XML

# Returns

The object built in the template XML with the id `name`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_markup -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self`.

# Returns

the tooltip text, or `None`. You should free the
 returned string with `g_free` when done.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_text -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self`.

# Returns

the tooltip text, or `None`. You should free the
 returned string with `g_free` when done.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_window -->
Returns the `Window` of the current tooltip. This can be the
`Window` created by default, or the custom tooltip window set
using `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_window`.

# Returns

The `Window` of the current tooltip.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_toplevel -->
This function returns the topmost widget in the container hierarchy
`self` is a part of. If `self` has no parent widgets, it will be
returned as the topmost widget. No reference will be added to the
returned widget; it should not be unreferenced.

Note the difference in behavior vs. `WidgetExt::get_ancestor`;
`gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_WINDOW)`
would return
`None` if `self` wasn’t inside a toplevel window, and if the
window was inside a `Window`-derived widget which was in turn
inside the toplevel `Window`.

To reliably find the toplevel `Window`, use
`WidgetExt::get_toplevel` and call GTK_IS_WINDOW()
on the result. For instance, to get the title of a widget's toplevel
window, one might use:

```C
static const char *
get_widget_toplevel_title (GtkWidget *widget)
{
  GtkWidget *toplevel = gtk_widget_get_toplevel (widget);
  if (GTK_IS_WINDOW (toplevel))
    {
      return gtk_window_get_title (GTK_WINDOW (toplevel));
    }

  return NULL;
}
```

# Returns

the topmost ancestor of `self`, or `self` itself
 if there’s no ancestor.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_valign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:valign` property.

# Returns

the vertical alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_vexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand_set` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_visible -->
Determines whether the widget is visible. If you want to
take into account whether the widget’s parent is also marked as
visible, use `WidgetExt::is_visible` instead.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See `WidgetExt::set_visible`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_width -->
Returns the content width of the widget, as passed to its size-allocate implementation.
This is the size you should be using in `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`. For pointer
events, see `WidgetExt::contains`.

# Returns

The width of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_add -->
Makes `self` the current grabbed widget.

This means that interaction with other widgets in the same
application is blocked and mouse as well as keyboard events
are delivered to this widget.

If `self` is not sensitive, it is not set as the current
grabbed widget and this function does nothing.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_focus -->
Causes `self` (or one of its descendents) to have the keyboard focus
for the `Window` it's inside.

`self` must be focusable, or have a ::grab_focus implementation that
transfers the focus to a descendant of `self` that is focusable.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_remove -->
Removes the grab from the given widget.

You have to pair calls to `WidgetExt::grab_add` and `WidgetExt::grab_remove`.

If `self` does not have the grab, this function does nothing.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_default -->
Determines whether `self` is the current default widget within its
toplevel.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is the current default widget within
 its toplevel, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_focus -->
Determines if the widget has the global input focus. See
`WidgetExt::is_focus` for the difference between having the global
input focus, and only having the focus within a toplevel.

# Returns

`true` if the widget has the global input focus.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_grab -->
Determines whether the widget is currently grabbing events, so it
is the only widget receiving input events (keyboard and mouse).

See also `WidgetExt::grab_add`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is in the grab_widgets stack
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_visible_focus -->
Determines if the widget should show a visible indication that
it has the global input focus. This is a convenience function for
use in ::draw handlers that takes into account whether focus
indication should currently be shown in the toplevel window of
`self`. See `GtkWindowExt::get_focus_visible` for more information
about focus indication.

To find out if the widget has the global input focus, use
`WidgetExt::has_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget should display a “focus rectangle”
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn hide -->
Reverses the effects of `WidgetExt::show`, causing the widget to be
hidden (invisible to the user).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn in_destruction -->
Returns whether the widget is currently being destroyed.
This information can sometimes be used to avoid doing
unnecessary work.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is being destroyed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn init_template -->
Creates and initializes child widgets defined in templates. This
function must be called in the instance initializer for any
class which assigned itself a template using `WidgetClass::set_template`

It is important to call this function in the instance initializer
of a `Widget` subclass and not in `gobject::Object.constructed`() or
`gobject::Object.constructor`() for two reasons.

One reason is that generally derived widgets will assume that parent
class composite widgets have been created in their instance
initializers.

Another reason is that when calling `gobject::Object::new` on a widget with
composite templates, it’s important to build the composite widgets
before the construct properties are set. Properties passed to `gobject::Object::new`
should take precedence over properties set in the private template XML.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn input_shape_combine_region -->
Sets an input shape for this widget’s GDK surface. This allows for
windows which react to mouse click in a nonrectangular region, see
`gdk::SurfaceExt::input_shape_combine_region` for more information.
## `region`
shape to be added, or `None` to remove an existing shape
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_action_group -->
Inserts `group` into `self`. Children of `self` that implement
`Actionable` can then be associated with actions in `group` by
setting their “action-name” to
`prefix`.`action-name`.

If `group` is `None`, a previously inserted group for `name` is removed
from `self`.
## `name`
the prefix for actions in `group`
## `group`
a `gio::ActionGroup`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts `self` into the child widget list of `parent`.
It will be placed after `previous_sibling`, or at the beginning if `previous_sibling` is `None`.

After calling this function, gtk_widget_get_prev_sibling(widget) will return `previous_sibling`.

If `parent` is already set as the parent widget of `self`, this function can also be used
to reorder `self` in the child widget list of `parent`.
## `parent`
the parent `Widget` to insert `self` into
## `previous_sibling`
the new previous sibling of `self` or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts `self` into the child widget list of `parent`.
It will be placed before `next_sibling`, or at the end if `next_sibling` is `None`.

After calling this function, gtk_widget_get_next_sibling(widget) will return `next_sibling`.

If `parent` is already set as the parent widget of `self`, this function can also be used
to reorder `self` in the child widget list of `parent`.
## `parent`
the parent `Widget` to insert `self` into
## `next_sibling`
the new next sibling of `self` or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_ancestor -->
Determines whether `self` is somewhere inside `ancestor`, possibly with
intermediate containers.
## `ancestor`
another `Widget`

# Returns

`true` if `ancestor` contains `self` as a child,
 grandchild, great grandchild, etc.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_drawable -->
Determines whether `self` can be drawn to. A widget can be drawn
if it is mapped and visible.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is drawable, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_focus -->
Determines if the widget is the focus widget within its
toplevel. (This does not mean that the `Widget:has-focus` property is
necessarily set; `Widget:has-focus` will only be set if the
toplevel widget additionally has the global input focus.)

# Returns

`true` if the widget is the focus widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s effective sensitivity, which means
it is sensitive itself and also its parent widget is sensitive

# Returns

`true` if the widget is effectively sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_toplevel -->
Determines whether `self` is a toplevel widget.

Currently only ``GtkWindows`` are toplevel widgets.
Toplevel widgets have no parent widget and implement
the `Root` interface.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is a toplevel, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_visible -->
Determines whether the widget and all its parents are marked as
visible.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See also `WidgetExt::get_visible` and `WidgetExt::set_visible`

# Returns

`true` if the widget and all its parents are visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn keynav_failed -->
This function should be called whenever keyboard navigation within
a single widget hits a boundary. The function emits the
`Widget::keynav-failed` signal on the widget and its return
value should be interpreted in a way similar to the return value of
`WidgetExt::child_focus`:

When `true` is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboard
navigation is OK and/or there is nowhere we can/should move the
focus to.

When `false` is returned, the caller should continue with keyboard
navigation outside the widget, e.g. by calling
`WidgetExt::child_focus` on the widget’s toplevel.

The default ::keynav-failed handler returns `false` for
`DirectionType::TabForward` and `DirectionType::TabBackward`. For the other
values of `DirectionType` it returns `true`.

Whenever the default handler returns `true`, it also calls
`WidgetExt::error_bell` to notify the user of the failed keyboard
navigation.

A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed
(either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row of
`Entry` widgets where the user should be able to navigate the
entire row with the cursor keys, as e.g. known from user interfaces
that require entering license keys.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, `false`
 if the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboard
 navigation attempt in its parent container(s).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_accel_closures -->
Lists the closures used by `self` for accelerator group connections
with `AccelGroupExt::connect_by_path` or `AccelGroupExt::connect`.
The closures can be used to monitor accelerator changes on `self`,
by connecting to the `AccelGroup::accel-changed` signal of the
`AccelGroup` of a closure which can be found out with
`AccelGroup::from_accel_closure`.

# Returns


 a newly allocated `glib::List` of closures
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_action_prefixes -->
Retrieves a `None`-terminated array of strings containing the prefixes of
`gio::ActionGroup`'s available to `self`.

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of strings.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_mnemonic_labels -->
Returns a newly allocated list of the widgets, normally labels, for
which this widget is the target of a mnemonic (see for example,
`LabelExt::set_mnemonic_widget`).

The widgets in the list are not individually referenced. If you
want to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you
must call `g_list_foreach (result,
(GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and then unref all the
widgets afterwards.

# Returns

the list of
 mnemonic labels; free this list
 with `glib::List::free` when you are done with it.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn map -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be mapped if it isn’t already.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn measure -->
Measures `self` in the orientation `orientation` and for the given `for_size`.
As an example, if `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal` and `for_size` is 300,
this functions will compute the minimum and natural width of `self` if
it is allocated at a height of 300 pixels.

See [`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management] for
a more details on implementing `WidgetClass.measure`().
## `orientation`
the orientation to measure
## `for_size`
Size for the opposite of `orientation`, i.e.
 if `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal`, this is
 the height the widget should be measured with. The `Orientation::Vertical`
 case is analogous. This way, both height-for-width and width-for-height
 requests can be implemented. If no size is known, -1 can be passed.
## `minimum`
location to store the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural`
location to store the natural size, or `None`
## `minimum_baseline`
location to store the baseline
 position for the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_baseline`
location to store the baseline
 position for the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn mnemonic_activate -->
Emits the `Widget::mnemonic-activate` signal.
## `group_cycling`
`true` if there are other widgets with the same mnemonic

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn observe_children -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the children of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping to track
children and emit signals on the returned listmodel. It may slow down
operations a lot.

Applications should try hard to avoid calling this function because of
the slowdowns.

# Returns

a `gio::ListModel` tracking `self`'s children
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn observe_controllers -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the ``GtkEventControllers`` of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping to track
controllers and emit signals on the returned listmodel. It may slow down
operations a lot.

Applications should try hard to avoid calling this function because of
the slowdowns.

# Returns

a `gio::ListModel` tracking `self`'s controllers
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn pick -->
Finds the descendant of `self` (including `self` itself) closest
to the screen at the point (`x`, `y`). The point must be given in
widget coordinates, so (0, 0) is assumed to be the top left of
`self`'s content area.

Usually widgets will return `None` if the given coordinate is not
contained in `self` checked via `WidgetExt::contains`. Otherwise
they will recursively try to find a child that does not return `None`.
Widgets are however free to customize their picking algorithm.

This function is used on the toplevel to determine the widget below
the mouse cursor for purposes of hover hilighting and delivering events.
## `x`
X coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `y`
Y coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `flags`
Flags to influence what is picked

# Returns

The widget descendant at the given
 coordinate or `None` if none.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_allocate -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.

Flags the widget for a rerun of the `WidgetClass`::size_allocate
function. Use this function instead of `WidgetExt::queue_resize`
when the `self`'s size request didn't change but it wants to
reposition its contents.

An example user of this function is `WidgetExt::set_halign`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_compute_expand -->
Mark `self` as needing to recompute its expand flags. Call
this function when setting legacy expand child properties
on the child of a container.

See `WidgetExt::compute_expand`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_draw -->
Schedules this widget to be redrawn in paint phase of the
current or the next frame. This means `self`'s `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`
implementation will be called.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_resize -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
Flags a widget to have its size renegotiated; should
be called when a widget for some reason has a new size request.
For example, when you change the text in a `Label`, `Label`
queues a resize to ensure there’s enough space for the new text.

Note that you cannot call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` on a widget
from inside its implementation of the `WidgetClass`::size_allocate
virtual method. Calls to `WidgetExt::queue_resize` from inside
`WidgetClass`::size_allocate will be silently ignored.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_resize_no_redraw -->
This function works like `WidgetExt::queue_resize`,
except that the widget is not invalidated.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn realize -->
Creates the GDK (windowing system) resources associated with a
widget. For example, `self`->surface will be created when a widget
is realized. Normally realization happens implicitly; if you show
a widget and all its parent containers, then the widget will be
realized and mapped automatically.

Realizing a widget requires all
the widget’s parent widgets to be realized; calling
`WidgetExt::realize` realizes the widget’s parents in addition to
`self` itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel window
when you realize it, bad things will happen.

This function is primarily used in widget implementations, and
isn’t very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you might
need it, a better approach is to connect to a signal that will be
called after the widget is realized automatically, such as
`Widget::realize`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn register_surface -->
Registers a `gdk::Surface` with the widget and sets it up so that
the widget receives events for it. Call `WidgetExt::unregister_surface`
when destroying the surface.

Before 3.8 you needed to call `gdk_surface_set_user_data` directly to set
this up. This is now deprecated and you should use `WidgetExt::register_surface`
instead. Old code will keep working as is, although some new features like
transparency might not work perfectly.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_accelerator -->
Removes an accelerator from `self`, previously installed with
`WidgetExt::add_accelerator`.
## `accel_group`
accel group for this widget
## `accel_key`
GDK keyval of the accelerator
## `accel_mods`
modifier key combination of the accelerator

# Returns

whether an accelerator was installed and could be removed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_controller -->
Removes `controller` from `self`, so that it doesn't process
events anymore. It should not be used again.

Widgets will remove all event controllers automatically when they
are destroyed, there is normally no need to call this function.
## `controller`
a `EventController`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_mnemonic_label -->
Removes a widget from the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). The widget
must have previously been added to the list with
`WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
## `label`
a `Widget` that was previously set as a mnemonic label for
 `self` with `WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
<!-- trait WidgetExtManual::fn remove_tick_callback -->
Removes a tick callback previously registered with
`Widget::add_tick_callback`.
## `id`
an id returned by `Widget::add_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn reset_style -->
Updates the style context of `self` and all descendants
by updating its widget path. ``GtkContainers`` may want
to use this on a child when reordering it in a way that a different
style might apply to it. See also `ContainerExt::get_path_for_child`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_accel_path -->
Given an accelerator group, `accel_group`, and an accelerator path,
`accel_path`, sets up an accelerator in `accel_group` so whenever the
key binding that is defined for `accel_path` is pressed, `self`
will be activated. This removes any accelerators (for any
accelerator group) installed by previous calls to
`WidgetExt::set_accel_path`. Associating accelerators with
paths allows them to be modified by the user and the modifications
to be saved for future use. (See `AccelMap::save`.)

This function is a low level function that would most likely
be used by a menu creation system.

If you only want to
set up accelerators on menu items `GtkMenuItemExt::set_accel_path`
provides a somewhat more convenient interface.

Note that `accel_path` string will be stored in a `glib::Quark`. Therefore, if you
pass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it first with
`g_intern_static_string`.
## `accel_path`
path used to look up the accelerator
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_focus -->
Specifies whether `self` can own the input focus.

Note that having `can_focus` be `true` is only one of the
necessary conditions for being focusable. A widget must
also be sensitive and not have a ancestor that is marked
as not child-focusable in order to receive input focus.

See `WidgetExt::grab_focus` for actually setting the input
focus on a widget.
## `can_focus`
whether or not `self` can own the input focus.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_target -->
Sets whether `self` can be the target of pointer events.
## `can_target`
whether this widget should be able to receive pointer events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_child_visible -->
Sets whether `self` should be mapped along with its when its parent
is mapped and `self` has been shown with `WidgetExt::show`.

The child visibility can be set for widget before it is added to
a container with `WidgetExt::set_parent`, to avoid mapping
children unnecessary before immediately unmapping them. However
it will be reset to its default state of `true` when the widget
is removed from a container.

Note that changing the child visibility of a widget does not
queue a resize on the widget. Most of the time, the size of
a widget is computed from all visible children, whether or
not they are mapped. If this is not the case, the container
can queue a resize itself.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.
## `child_visible`
if `true`, `self` should be mapped along with its parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the cursor to be shown when pointer devices point towards `self`.

If the `cursor` is NULL, `self` will use the cursor inherited from the
parent widget.
## `cursor`
the new cursor or `None` to use the default
 cursor
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_cursor_from_name -->
Sets a named cursor to be shown when pointer devices point towards `self`.

This is a utility function that creates a cursor via
`gdk::Cursor::new_from_name` and then sets it on `self` with
`WidgetExt::set_cursor`. See those 2 functions for details.

On top of that, this function allows `name` to be `None`, which will
do the same as calling `WidgetExt::set_cursor` with a `None` cursor.
## `name`
The name of the cursor or `None` to use the default
 cursor
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_direction -->
Sets the reading direction on a particular widget. This direction
controls the primary direction for widgets containing text,
and also the direction in which the children of a container are
packed. The ability to set the direction is present in order
so that correct localization into languages with right-to-left
reading directions can be done. Generally, applications will
let the default reading direction present, except for containers
where the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitly
visual rather than logical (such as buttons for text justification).

If the direction is set to `TextDirection::None`, then the value
set by `Widget::set_default_direction` will be used.
## `dir`
the new direction
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_focus_child -->
Set `child` as the current focus child of `self`. The previous
focus child will be unset.

This function is only suitable for widget implementations.
If you want a certain widget to get the input focus, call
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` on it.
## `child`
a direct child widget of `self` or `None`
 to unset the focus child of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_focus_on_click -->
Sets whether the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with the mouse.
Making mouse clicks not grab focus is useful in places like toolbars where
you don’t want the keyboard focus removed from the main area of the
application.
## `focus_on_click`
whether the widget should grab focus when clicked with the mouse
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_font_map -->
Sets the font map to use for Pango rendering. When not set, the widget
will inherit the font map from its parent.
## `font_map`
a `pango::FontMap`, or `None` to unset any previously
 set font map
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_font_options -->
Sets the `cairo::FontOptions` used for Pango rendering in this widget.
When not set, the default font options for the `gdk::Display` will be used.
## `options`
a `cairo::FontOptions`, or `None` to unset any
 previously set default font options.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_halign -->
Sets the horizontal alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:halign` property.
## `align`
the horizontal alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_has_surface -->
Specifies whether `self` has a `gdk::Surface` of its own. Note that
all realized widgets have a non-`None` “window” pointer
(`WidgetExt::get_surface` never returns a `None` surface when a widget
is realized), but for many of them it’s actually the `gdk::Surface` of
one of its parent widgets. Widgets that do not create a `window` for
themselves in `Widget::realize` must announce this by
calling this function with `has_surface` = `false`.

This function should only be called by widget implementations,
and they should call it in their `init` function.
## `has_surface`
whether or not `self` has a surface.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_has_tooltip -->
Sets the has-tooltip property on `self` to `has_tooltip`. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.
## `has_tooltip`
whether or not `self` has a tooltip.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Call this function to set the expand flag if you would like your
widget to become larger horizontally when the window has extra
room.

By default, widgets automatically expand if any of their children
want to expand. (To see if a widget will automatically expand given
its current children and state, call `WidgetExt::compute_expand`. A
container can decide how the expandability of children affects the
expansion of the container by overriding the compute_expand virtual
method on `Widget`.).

Setting hexpand explicitly with this function will override the
automatic expand behavior.

This function forces the widget to expand or not to expand,
regardless of children. The override occurs because
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` sets the hexpand-set property (see
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set`) which causes the widget’s hexpand
value to be used, rather than looking at children and widget state.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand_set -->
Sets whether the hexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_hexpand`) will
be used.

The hexpand-set property will be set automatically when you call
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` to set hexpand, so the most likely
reason to use this function would be to unset an explicit expand
flag.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.
## `set`
value for hexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_layout_manager -->
Sets the layout manager delegate instance that provides an implementation
for measuring and allocating the children of `self`.
## `layout_manager`
a `LayoutManager`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_bottom -->
Sets the bottom margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.
## `margin`
the bottom margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_end -->
Sets the end margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-end` property.
## `margin`
the end margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_start -->
Sets the start margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-start` property.
## `margin`
the start margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_top -->
Sets the top margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-top` property.
## `margin`
the top margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_name -->
Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from a
CSS file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular name
in the CSS file. See the documentation for the CSS syntax (on the
same page as the docs for `StyleContext`).

Note that the CSS syntax has certain special characters to delimit
and represent elements in a selector (period, #, >, *...), so using
these will make your widget impossible to match by name. Any combination
of alphanumeric symbols, dashes and underscores will suffice.
## `name`
name for the widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_opacity -->
Request the `self` to be rendered partially transparent,
with opacity 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque. (Opacity values
are clamped to the [0,1] range.).
This works on both toplevel widget, and child widgets, although there
are some limitations:

For toplevel widgets this depends on the capabilities of the windowing
system. On X11 this has any effect only on X displays with a compositing manager
running. See `gdk::Display::is_composited`. On Windows it should work
always, although setting a window’s opacity after the window has been
shown causes it to flicker once on Windows.

For child widgets it doesn’t work if any affected widget has a native window.
## `opacity`
desired opacity, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_overflow -->
Sets how `self` treats content that is drawn outside the widget's content area.
See the definition of `Overflow` for details.

This setting is provided for widget implementations and should not be used by
application code.

The default value is `Overflow::Visible`.
## `overflow`
desired overflow
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_parent -->
This function is useful only when implementing subclasses of
`Widget`.
Sets `parent` as the parent widget of `self`, and takes care of
some details such as updating the state and style of the child
to reflect its new location and resizing the parent. The opposite
function is `WidgetExt::unparent`.
## `parent`
parent widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_receives_default -->
Specifies whether `self` will be treated as the default
widget within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if
another widget is the default.
## `receives_default`
whether or not `self` can be a default widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_sensitive -->
Sets the sensitivity of a widget. A widget is sensitive if the user
can interact with it. Insensitive widgets are “grayed out” and the
user can’t interact with them. Insensitive widgets are known as
“inactive”, “disabled”, or “ghosted” in some other toolkits.
## `sensitive`
`true` to make the widget sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_size_request -->
Sets the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget’s size
request will be at least `width` by `height`. You can use this
function to force a widget to be larger than it normally would be.

In most cases, `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size` is a better choice for
toplevel windows than this function; setting the default size will
still allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size request
will force them to leave the window at least as large as the size
request. When dealing with window sizes,
`gtk_window_set_geometry_hints` can be a useful function as well.

Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes,
translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action
can all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it's
basically impossible to hardcode a size that will always be
correct.

The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget can
accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.
However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than
its requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more
space than it requested.

If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), then
the “natural” size request of the widget will be used instead.

The size request set here does not include any margin from the
`Widget` properties margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, and
margin-bottom, but it does include pretty much all other padding
or border properties set by any subclass of `Widget`.
## `width`
width `self` should request, or -1 to unset
## `height`
height `self` should request, or -1 to unset
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns on flag
values in the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).

This function accepts the values `StateFlags::DirLtr` and
`StateFlags::DirRtl` but ignores them. If you want to set the widget's
direction, use `WidgetExt::set_direction`.

It is worth mentioning that any other state than `StateFlags::Insensitive`,
will be propagated down to all non-internal children if `self` is a
`Container`, while `StateFlags::Insensitive` itself will be propagated
down to all `Container` children by different means than turning on the
state flag down the hierarchy, both `WidgetExt::get_state_flags` and
`WidgetExt::is_sensitive` will make use of these.
## `flags`
State flags to turn on
## `clear`
Whether to clear state before turning on `flags`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_support_multidevice -->
Enables or disables multiple pointer awareness. If this setting is `true`,
`self` will start receiving multiple, per device enter/leave events. Note
that if custom ``GdkSurfaces`` are created in `Widget::realize`,
`gdk::SurfaceExt::set_support_multidevice` will have to be called manually on them.
## `support_multidevice`
`true` to support input from multiple devices.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_surface -->
Sets a widget’s surface. This function should only be used in a
widget’s `Widget::realize` implementation. The `surface` passed is
usually either new surface created with `gdk_surface_new`, or the
surface of its parent widget as returned by
`gtk_widget_get_parent_surface`.

Widgets must indicate whether they will create their own `gdk::Surface`
by calling `WidgetExt::set_has_surface`. This is usually done in the
widget’s `init` function.

Note that this function does not add any reference to `surface`.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_markup -->
Sets `markup` as the contents of the tooltip, which is marked up with
 the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

This function will take care of setting `Widget:has-tooltip` to `true`
and of the default handler for the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-markup` property and
`Tooltip::set_markup`.
## `markup`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_text -->
Sets `text` as the contents of the tooltip. This function will take
care of setting `Widget:has-tooltip` to `true` and of the default
handler for the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-text` property and `Tooltip::set_text`.
## `text`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_window -->
Replaces the default window used for displaying
tooltips with `custom_window`. GTK+ will take care of showing and
hiding `custom_window` at the right moment, to behave likewise as
the default tooltip window. If `custom_window` is `None`, the default
tooltip window will be used.
## `custom_window`
a `Window`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_valign -->
Sets the vertical alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:valign` property.
## `align`
the vertical alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` for more detail.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand_set -->
Sets whether the vexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`) will
be used.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set` for more detail.
## `set`
value for vexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility state of `self`. Note that setting this to
`true` doesn’t mean the widget is actually viewable, see
`WidgetExt::get_visible`.

This function simply calls `WidgetExt::show` or `WidgetExt::hide`
but is nicer to use when the visibility of the widget depends on
some condition.
## `visible`
whether the widget should be shown or not
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn show -->
Flags a widget to be displayed. Any widget that isn’t shown will
not appear on the screen.

Remember that you have to show the containers containing a widget,
in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear onscreen.

When a toplevel container is shown, it is immediately realized and
mapped; other shown widgets are realized and mapped when their
toplevel container is realized and mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn size_allocate -->
This is a simple form of `WidgetExt::allocate` that takes the new position
of `self` as part of `allocation`.
## `allocation`
position and size to be allocated to `self`
## `baseline`
The baseline of the child, or -1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn snapshot_child -->
When a widget receives a call to the snapshot function, it must send
synthetic `Widget::snapshot` calls to all children. This function
provides a convenient way of doing this. A widget, when it receives
a call to its `Widget::snapshot` function, calls
`WidgetExt::snapshot_child` once for each child, passing in
the `snapshot` the widget received.

`WidgetExt::snapshot_child` takes care of translating the origin of
`snapshot`, and deciding whether the child needs to be snapshot.
## `child`
a child of `self`
## `snapshot`
`Snapshot` as passed to the widget. In particular, no
 calls to `Snapshot::translate` or other transform calls should
 have been made.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn translate_coordinates -->
Translate coordinates relative to `self`’s allocation to coordinates
relative to `dest_widget`’s allocations. In order to perform this
operation, both widget must share a common toplevel.
## `dest_widget`
a `Widget`
## `src_x`
X position relative to `self`
## `src_y`
Y position relative to `self`
## `dest_x`
location to store X position relative to `dest_widget`
## `dest_y`
location to store Y position relative to `dest_widget`

# Returns

`false` if `self` and `dest_widget` have no common
 ancestor. In this case, 0 is stored in
 *`dest_x` and *`dest_y`. Otherwise `true`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn trigger_tooltip_query -->
Triggers a tooltip query on the display where the toplevel of `self`
is located. See `gtk_tooltip_trigger_tooltip_query` for more
information.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unmap -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be unmapped if it’s currently mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unparent -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
Should be called by parent widgets to dissociate `self`
from the parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unrealize -->
This function is only useful in widget implementations.
Causes a widget to be unrealized (frees all GDK resources
associated with the widget, such as `self`->surface).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unregister_surface -->
Unregisters a `gdk::Surface` from the widget that was previously set up with
`WidgetExt::register_surface`. You need to call this when the surface is
no longer used by the widget, such as when you destroy it.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unset_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns off flag
values for the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).
See `WidgetExt::set_state_flags`.
## `flags`
State flags to turn off
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_accel_closures_changed -->
The ::accel-closures-changed signal gets emitted when accelerators for this
widget get added, removed or changed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_can_activate_accel -->
Determines whether an accelerator that activates the signal
identified by `signal_id` can currently be activated.
This signal is present to allow applications and derived
widgets to override the default `Widget` handling
for determining whether an accelerator can be activated.
## `signal_id`
the ID of a signal installed on `widget`

# Returns

`true` if the signal can be activated.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_destroy -->
Signals that all holders of a reference to the widget should release
the reference that they hold. May result in finalization of the widget
if all references are released.

This signal is not suitable for saving widget state.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_direction_changed -->
The ::direction-changed signal is emitted when the text direction
of a widget changes.
## `previous_direction`
the previous text direction of `widget`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_begin -->
The ::drag-begin signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag is
started. A typical reason to connect to this signal is to set up a
custom drag icon with e.g. `WidgetExt::drag_source_set_icon_paintable`.

Note that some widgets set up a drag icon in the default handler of
this signal, so you may have to use `g_signal_connect_after` to
override what the default handler did.
## `context`
the drag context
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_data_delete -->
The ::drag-data-delete signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag
with the action `gdk::DragAction::Move` is successfully completed. The signal
handler is responsible for deleting the data that has been dropped. What
"delete" means depends on the context of the drag operation.
## `context`
the drag context
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_data_get -->
The ::drag-data-get signal is emitted on the drag source when the drop
site requests the data which is dragged. It is the responsibility of
the signal handler to fill `data` with the data in the format which
is indicated by `info`. See `SelectionData::set` and
`SelectionData::set_text`.
## `context`
the drag context
## `data`
the `SelectionData` to be filled with the dragged data
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_data_received -->
The ::drag-data-received signal is emitted on the drop site when the
dragged data has been received. If the data was received in order to
determine whether the drop will be accepted, the handler is expected
to call `gdk_drag_status` and not finish the drag.
If the data was received in response to a `Widget::drag-drop` signal
(and this is the last target to be received), the handler for this
signal is expected to process the received data and then call
`gdk_drag_finish`, setting the `success` parameter depending on
whether the data was processed successfully.

Applications must create some means to determine why the signal was emitted
and therefore whether to call `gdk_drag_status` or `gdk_drag_finish`.

The handler may inspect the selected action with
`gdk_drag_context_get_selected_action` before calling
`gdk_drag_finish`, e.g. to implement `gdk::DragAction::Ask` as
shown in the following example:

```C
void
drag_data_received (GtkWidget          *widget,
                    GdkDrop            *drop,
                    GtkSelectionData   *data)
{
  if ((data->length >= 0) && (data->format == 8))
    {
      GdkDragAction action;

      // handle data here

      action = gdk_drop_get_actions (drop);
      if (!gdk_drag_action_is_unique (action))
        {
          GtkWidget *dialog;
          gint response;

          dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (NULL,
                                           GTK_DIALOG_MODAL |
                                           GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
                                           GTK_MESSAGE_INFO,
                                           GTK_BUTTONS_YES_NO,
                                           "Move the data ?\n");
          response = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
          gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);

          if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_YES)
            action = GDK_ACTION_MOVE;
          else
            action = GDK_ACTION_COPY;
         }

      gdk_drop_finish (context, action);
    }
  else
    gdk_drop_finish (context, 0);
 }
```
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
where the drop happened
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_drop -->
The ::drag-drop signal is emitted on the drop site when the user drops
the data onto the widget. The signal handler must determine whether
the cursor position is in a drop zone or not. If it is not in a drop
zone, it returns `false` and no further processing is necessary.
Otherwise, the handler returns `true`. In this case, the handler must
ensure that `gdk_drag_finish` is called to let the source know that
the drop is done. The call to `gdk_drag_finish` can be done either
directly or in a `Widget::drag-data-received` handler which gets
triggered by calling `WidgetExt::drag_get_data` to receive the data for one
or more of the supported targets.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current cursor position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current cursor position

# Returns

whether the cursor position is in a drop zone
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_end -->
The ::drag-end signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag is
finished. A typical reason to connect to this signal is to undo
things done in `Widget::drag-begin`.
## `context`
the drag context
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_failed -->
The ::drag-failed signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag has
failed. The signal handler may hook custom code to handle a failed DnD
operation based on the type of error, it returns `true` is the failure has
been already handled (not showing the default "drag operation failed"
animation), otherwise it returns `false`.
## `context`
the drag context
## `result`
the result of the drag operation

# Returns

`true` if the failed drag operation has been already handled.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_leave -->
The ::drag-leave signal is emitted on the drop site when the cursor
leaves the widget. A typical reason to connect to this signal is to
undo things done in `Widget::drag-motion`, e.g. undo highlighting
with `WidgetExt::drag_unhighlight`.


Likewise, the `Widget::drag-leave` signal is also emitted before the
::drag-drop signal, for instance to allow cleaning up of a preview item
created in the `Widget::drag-motion` signal handler.
## `context`
the drag context
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_drag_motion -->
The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
If it is not in a drop zone, it returns `false` and no further processing
is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns `true`. In this case, the
handler is responsible for providing the necessary information for
displaying feedback to the user, by calling `gdk_drag_status`.

If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be
made based solely on the cursor position and the type of the data, the
handler may inspect the dragged data by calling `WidgetExt::drag_get_data` and
defer the `gdk_drag_status` call to the `Widget::drag-data-received`
handler. Note that you must pass `DestDefaults::Drop`,
`DestDefaults::Motion` or `DestDefaults::All` to `WidgetExt::drag_dest_set`
when using the drag-motion signal that way.

Also note that there is no drag-enter signal. The drag receiver has to
keep track of whether he has received any drag-motion signals since the
last `Widget::drag-leave` and if not, treat the drag-motion signal as
an "enter" signal. Upon an "enter", the handler will typically highlight
the drop site with `WidgetExt::drag_highlight`.

```C
static void
drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
             GdkDrop   *drop,
             gint       x,
             gint       y,
{
  GdkAtom target;

  PrivateData *private_data = GET_PRIVATE_DATA (widget);

  if (!private_data->drag_highlight)
   {
     private_data->drag_highlight = 1;
     gtk_drag_highlight (widget);
   }

  target = gtk_drag_dest_find_target (widget, drop, NULL);
  if (target == NULL)
    gdk_drop_status (drop, 0);
  else
   {
     private_data->pending_status
        = gdk_drop_get_actions (drop);
     gtk_drag_get_data (widget, drop, target);
   }

  return TRUE;
}

static void
drag_data_received (GtkWidget        *widget,
                    GdkDrop          *drop,
                    GtkSelectionData *selection_data)
{
  PrivateData *private_data = GET_PRIVATE_DATA (widget);

  if (private_data->suggested_action)
   {
     private_data->suggested_action = 0;

     // We are getting this data due to a request in drag_motion,
     // rather than due to a request in drag_drop, so we are just
     // supposed to call gdk_drag_status(), not actually paste in
     // the data.

     str = gtk_selection_data_get_text (selection_data);
     if (!data_is_acceptable (str))
       gdk_drop_status (drop, 0);
     else
       gdk_drag_status (drop, GDK_ACTION_ALL);
   }
  else
   {
     // accept the drop
   }
}
```
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current cursor position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current cursor position

# Returns

whether the cursor position is in a drop zone
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_grab_notify -->
The ::grab-notify signal is emitted when a widget becomes
shadowed by a GTK+ grab (not a pointer or keyboard grab) on
another widget, or when it becomes unshadowed due to a grab
being removed.

A widget is shadowed by a `WidgetExt::grab_add` when the topmost
grab widget in the grab stack of its window group is not
its ancestor.
## `was_grabbed`
`false` if the widget becomes shadowed, `true`
 if it becomes unshadowed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_hide -->
The ::hide signal is emitted when `widget` is hidden, for example with
`WidgetExt::hide`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_keynav_failed -->
Gets emitted if keyboard navigation fails.
See `WidgetExt::keynav_failed` for details.
## `direction`
the direction of movement

# Returns

`true` if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, `false`
 if the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboard
 navigation attempt in its parent widget(s).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_map -->
The ::map signal is emitted when `widget` is going to be mapped, that is
when the widget is visible (which is controlled with
`WidgetExt::set_visible`) and all its parents up to the toplevel widget
are also visible.

The ::map signal can be used to determine whether a widget will be drawn,
for instance it can resume an animation that was stopped during the
emission of `Widget::unmap`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_mnemonic_activate -->
The default handler for this signal activates `widget` if `group_cycling`
is `false`, or just makes `widget` grab focus if `group_cycling` is `true`.
## `group_cycling`
`true` if there are other widgets with the same mnemonic

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
`false` to propagate the event further.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_popup_menu -->
This signal gets emitted whenever a widget should pop up a context
menu. This usually happens through the standard key binding mechanism;
by pressing a certain key while a widget is focused, the user can cause
the widget to pop up a menu. For example, the `Entry` widget creates
a menu with clipboard commands. See the
[Popup Menu Migration Checklist][checklist-popup-menu]
for an example of how to use this signal.

# Returns

`true` if a menu was activated
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_query_tooltip -->
Emitted when `Widget:has-tooltip` is `true` and the hover timeout
has expired with the cursor hovering "above" `widget`; or emitted when `widget` got
focus in keyboard mode.

Using the given coordinates, the signal handler should determine
whether a tooltip should be shown for `widget`. If this is the case
`true` should be returned, `false` otherwise. Note that if
`keyboard_mode` is `true`, the values of `x` and `y` are undefined and
should not be used.

The signal handler is free to manipulate `tooltip` with the therefore
destined function calls.
## `x`
the x coordinate of the cursor position where the request has
 been emitted, relative to `widget`'s left side
## `y`
the y coordinate of the cursor position where the request has
 been emitted, relative to `widget`'s top
## `keyboard_mode`
`true` if the tooltip was triggered using the keyboard
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`

# Returns

`true` if `tooltip` should be shown right now, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_realize -->
The ::realize signal is emitted when `widget` is associated with a
`gdk::Surface`, which means that `WidgetExt::realize` has been called or the
widget has been mapped (that is, it is going to be drawn).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_show -->
The ::show signal is emitted when `widget` is shown, for example with
`WidgetExt::show`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_size_allocate -->
## `width`
the content width of the widget
## `height`
the content height of the widget
## `baseline`
the baseline
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_state_flags_changed -->
The ::state-flags-changed signal is emitted when the widget state
changes, see `WidgetExt::get_state_flags`.
## `flags`
The previous state flags.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_style_updated -->
The ::style-updated signal is a convenience signal that is emitted when the
`StyleContext::changed` signal is emitted on the `widget`'s associated
`StyleContext` as returned by `WidgetExt::get_style_context`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_unmap -->
The ::unmap signal is emitted when `widget` is going to be unmapped, which
means that either it or any of its parents up to the toplevel widget have
been set as hidden.

As ::unmap indicates that a widget will not be shown any longer, it can be
used to, for example, stop an animation on the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_unrealize -->
The ::unrealize signal is emitted when the `gdk::Surface` associated with
`widget` is destroyed, which means that `WidgetExt::unrealize` has been
called or the widget has been unmapped (that is, it is going to be
hidden).

<!-- struct WidgetPaintable -->
`WidgetPaintable` is an implementation of the `gdk::Paintable` interface
that allows displaying the contents of a `Widget`.

`WidgetPaintable` will also take care of the widget not being in a
state where it can be drawn (like when it isn't shown) and just draw
nothing or where it does not have a size (like when it is hidden) and
report no size in that case.

Of course, `WidgetPaintable` allows you to monitor widgets for size
changes by emitting the `gdk::Paintable::invalidate-size` signal whenever
the size of the widget changes as well as for visual changes by
emitting the `gdk::Paintable::invalidate-contents` signal whenever the
widget changes.

You can of course use a `WidgetPaintable` everywhere a
`gdk::Paintable` is allowed, including using it on a `Picture` (or one
of its parents) that it was set on itself via `PictureExt::set_paintable`.
The paintable will take care of recursion when this happens. If you do
this however, ensure the `Picture:can-shrink` property is set to
`true` or you might end up with an infinitely growing widget.

<!-- struct WidgetPath -->
`WidgetPath` is a boxed type that represents a widget hierarchy from
the topmost widget, typically a toplevel, to any child. This widget
path abstraction is used in `StyleContext` on behalf of the real
widget in order to query style information.

If you are using GTK+ widgets, you probably will not need to use
this API directly, as there is `WidgetExt::get_path`, and the style
context returned by `WidgetExt::get_style_context` will be automatically
updated on widget hierarchy changes.

The widget path generation is generally simple:

## Defining a button within a window


```C
{
  GtkWidgetPath *path;

  path = gtk_widget_path_new ();
  gtk_widget_path_append_type (path, GTK_TYPE_WINDOW);
  gtk_widget_path_append_type (path, GTK_TYPE_BUTTON);
}
```

Although more complex information, such as widget names, or
different classes (property that may be used by other widget
types) and intermediate regions may be included:

## Defining the first tab widget in a notebook


```C
{
  GtkWidgetPath *path;
  guint pos;

  path = gtk_widget_path_new ();

  pos = gtk_widget_path_append_type (path, GTK_TYPE_NOTEBOOK);
  gtk_widget_path_iter_add_region (path, pos, "tab", GTK_REGION_EVEN | GTK_REGION_FIRST);

  pos = gtk_widget_path_append_type (path, GTK_TYPE_LABEL);
  gtk_widget_path_iter_set_name (path, pos, "first tab label");
}
```

All this information will be used to match the style information
that applies to the described widget.
<!-- impl WidgetPath::fn new -->
Returns an empty widget path.

# Returns

A newly created, empty, `WidgetPath`
<!-- impl WidgetPath::fn append_for_widget -->

<!-- impl WidgetPath::fn append_with_siblings -->
Appends a widget type with all its siblings to the widget hierarchy
represented by `self`. Using this function instead of
`WidgetPath::append_type` will allow the CSS theming to use
sibling matches in selectors and apply :nth-`child` pseudo classes.
In turn, it requires a lot more care in widget implementations as
widgets need to make sure to call `WidgetExt::reset_style` on all
involved widgets when the `siblings` path changes.
## `siblings`

 may not contain any siblings itself and it must not be modified
 afterwards.

position to get the sibling index for, -1 for the path head

# Returns

0 or the index into the list of siblings for the element at `pos`.
<!-- impl WidgetPath::fn iter_get_siblings -->

`g_print` the path or dump it in a gdb session.

# Returns

A new string describing `self`.
<!-- impl WidgetPath::fn unref -->
Decrements the reference count on `self`, freeing the structure
if the reference count reaches 0.
<!-- struct Window -->
A `Window` is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
(resize it, move it, close it,...).

# `Window` as `Buildable`

The `Window` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<accel-groups>` element, which supports any number of `<group>`
elements representing the `AccelGroup` objects you want to add to
your window (synonymous with `GtkWindowExt::add_accel_group`.

An example of a UI definition fragment with accel groups:

```plain
window.background
├── decoration
├── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
╰── <child>
```

`Window` has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background,
and a subnode with name decoration.

Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
decorations). `Window` also represents window states with the following
style classes on the main node: .tiled, .maximized, .fullscreen. Specialized
types of window often add their own discriminating style classes, such as
.popup or .tooltip.

`Window` adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
widget that is added as a titlebar child.

<!-- impl Window::fn new -->
Creates a new `Window`, which is a toplevel window that can
contain other widgets. Nearly always, the type of the window should
be `WindowType::Toplevel`. If you’re implementing something like a
popup menu from scratch (which is a bad idea, just use `Menu`),
you might use `WindowType::Popup`. `WindowType::Popup` is not for
dialogs, though in some other toolkits dialogs are called “popups”.
In GTK+, `WindowType::Popup` means a pop-up menu or pop-up tooltip.
On X11, popup windows are not controlled by the
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch].

If you simply want an undecorated window (no window borders), use
`GtkWindowExt::set_decorated`, don’t use `WindowType::Popup`.

All top-level windows created by `Window::new` are stored in
an internal top-level window list. This list can be obtained from
`Window::list_toplevels`. Due to Gtk+ keeping a reference to
the window internally, `Window::new` does not return a reference
to the caller.

To delete a `Window`, call `WidgetExt::destroy`.
## `type_`
type of window

# Returns

a new `Window`.
<!-- impl Window::fn get_default_icon_name -->
Returns the fallback icon name for windows that has been set
with `Window::set_default_icon_name`. The returned
string is owned by GTK+ and should not be modified. It
is only valid until the next call to
`Window::set_default_icon_name`.

# Returns

the fallback icon name for windows
<!-- impl Window::fn get_toplevels -->
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows.

If you want to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets or add new ones, be aware that
the list of toplevels will change and emit the "items-changed" signal.

# Returns

the list of toplevel widgets
<!-- impl Window::fn list_toplevels -->
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows. The widgets
in the list are not individually referenced. If you want
to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you must call
`g_list_foreach (result, (GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and
then unref all the widgets afterwards.

# Returns

list of toplevel widgets
<!-- impl Window::fn set_auto_startup_notification -->
By default, after showing the first `Window`, GTK+ calls
`gdk_notify_startup_complete`. Call this function to disable
the automatic startup notification. You might do this if your
first window is a splash screen, and you want to delay notification
until after your real main window has been shown, for example.

In that example, you would disable startup notification
temporarily, show your splash screen, then re-enable it so that
showing the main window would automatically result in notification.
## `setting`
`true` to automatically do startup notification
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon_name -->
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that haven't
had `gtk_window_set_icon_list` called on them from a named
themed icon, see `GtkWindowExt::set_icon_name`.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- impl Window::fn set_interactive_debugging -->
Opens or closes the [interactive debugger][interactive-debugging],
which offers access to the widget hierarchy of the application
and to useful debugging tools.
## `enable`
`true` to enable interactive debugging
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn activate_key -->
Activates mnemonics and accelerators for this `Window`. This is normally
called by the default ::key_press_event handler for toplevel windows,
however in some cases it may be useful to call this directly when
overriding the standard key handling for a toplevel window.
## `event`
a `gdk::EventKey`

# Returns

`true` if a mnemonic or accelerator was found and activated.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn add_accel_group -->
Associate `accel_group` with `self`, such that calling
`gtk_accel_groups_activate` on `self` will activate accelerators
in `accel_group`.
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn add_mnemonic -->
Adds a mnemonic to this window.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `target`
the widget that gets activated by the mnemonic
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn begin_move_drag -->
Starts moving a window. This function is used if an application has
window movement grips.
## `button`
mouse button that initiated the drag
## `x`
X position where the user clicked to initiate the drag, in window coordinates
## `y`
Y position where the user clicked to initiate the drag
## `timestamp`
timestamp from the click event that initiated the drag
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn begin_resize_drag -->
Starts resizing a window. This function is used if an application
has window resizing controls.
## `edge`
position of the resize control
## `button`
mouse button that initiated the drag
## `x`
X position where the user clicked to initiate the drag, in window coordinates
## `y`
Y position where the user clicked to initiate the drag
## `timestamp`
timestamp from the click event that initiated the drag
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn close -->
Requests that the window is closed, similar to what happens
when a window manager close button is clicked.

This function can be used with close buttons in custom
titlebars.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn deiconify -->
Asks to deiconify (i.e. unminimize) the specified `self`. Note
that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely deiconified
afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch])) could iconify it
again before your code which assumes deiconification gets to run.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn fullscreen -->
Asks to place `self` in the fullscreen state. Note that you
shouldn’t assume the window is definitely full screen afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could unfullscreen it
again, and not all window managers honor requests to fullscreen
windows. But normally the window will end up fullscreen. Just
don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn fullscreen_on_monitor -->
Asks to place `self` in the fullscreen state. Note that you shouldn't assume
the window is definitely full screen afterward.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property
## `monitor`
which monitor to go fullscreen on
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_accept_focus -->
Gets the value set by `GtkWindowExt::set_accept_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if window should receive the input focus
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_application -->
Gets the `Application` associated with the window (if any).

# Returns

a `Application`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_attached_to -->
Fetches the attach widget for this window. See
`GtkWindowExt::set_attached_to`.

# Returns

the widget where the window
is attached, or `None` if the window is not attached to any widget.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_decorated -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have decorations
such as a title bar via `GtkWindowExt::set_decorated`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have decorations
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_default_size -->
Gets the default size of the window. A value of -1 for the width or
height indicates that a default size has not been explicitly set
for that dimension, so the “natural” size of the window will be
used.
## `width`
location to store the default width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the default height, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_default_widget -->
Returns the default widget for `self`. See
`gtk_window_set_default` for more details.

# Returns

the default widget, or `None`
if there is none.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_deletable -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have a close button
via `GtkWindowExt::set_deletable`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have a close button
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_destroy_with_parent -->
Returns whether the window will be destroyed with its transient parent. See
gtk_window_set_destroy_with_parent ().

# Returns

`true` if the window will be destroyed with its transient parent.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_focus -->
Retrieves the current focused widget within the window.
Note that this is the widget that would have the focus
if the toplevel window focused; if the toplevel window
is not focused then `gtk_widget_has_focus (widget)` will
not be `true` for the widget.

# Returns

the currently focused widget,
or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_focus_on_map -->
Gets the value set by `GtkWindowExt::set_focus_on_map`.

# Returns

`true` if window should receive the input focus when
mapped.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_focus_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:focus-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if “focus rectangles” are supposed to be visible
 in this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_group -->
Returns the group for `self` or the default group, if
`self` is `None` or if `self` does not have an explicit
window group.

# Returns

the `WindowGroup` for a window or the default group
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_hide_on_close -->
Returns whether the window will be hidden when the close button is clicked.

# Returns

`true` if the window will be hidden
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_icon_name -->
Returns the name of the themed icon for the window,
see `GtkWindowExt::set_icon_name`.

# Returns

the icon name or `None` if the window has
no themed icon
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_mnemonic_modifier -->
Returns the mnemonic modifier for this window. See
`GtkWindowExt::set_mnemonic_modifier`.

# Returns

the modifier mask used to activate
 mnemonics on this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_mnemonics_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if mnemonics are supposed to be visible
in this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the window is modal. See `GtkWindowExt::set_modal`.

# Returns

`true` if the window is set to be modal and
 establishes a grab when shown
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_resizable -->
Gets the value set by `GtkWindowExt::set_resizable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can resize the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_size -->
Obtains the current size of `self`.

If `self` is not visible on screen, this function return the size GTK+
will suggest to the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch] for the initial window
size (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window manager
will actually select). See: `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size`.

Depending on the windowing system and the window manager constraints,
the size returned by this function may not match the size set using
`GtkWindowExt::resize`; additionally, since `GtkWindowExt::resize` may be
implemented as an asynchronous operation, GTK+ cannot guarantee in any
way that this code:


```C
  GtkWindow *window = GTK_WINDOW (gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL));
  int width = 500;
  int height = 300;
  gtk_window_resize (window, width, height);

  int new_width, new_height;
  gtk_window_get_size (window, &new_width, &new_height);
```

will result in `new_width` and `new_height` matching `width` and
`height`, respectively.

This function will return the logical size of the `Window`,
excluding the widgets used in client side decorations; there is,
however, no guarantee that the result will be completely accurate
because client side decoration may include widgets that depend on
the user preferences and that may not be visibile at the time you
call this function.

The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
stored across sessions; use `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size` to
restore them when before showing the window.

To avoid potential race conditions, you should only call this
function in response to a size change notification, for instance
inside a handler for the `Widget::size-allocate` signal, or
inside a handler for the `Widget::configure-event` signal:


```C
static void
on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget,
                  const GtkAllocation *allocation,
                  int baseline)
{
  int new_width, new_height;

  gtk_window_get_size (GTK_WINDOW (widget), &new_width, &new_height);

  // ...
}
```

Note that, if you connect to the `Widget::size-allocate` signal,
you should not use the dimensions of the `Allocation` passed to
the signal handler, as the allocation may contain client side
decorations added by GTK+, depending on the windowing system in
use.

If you are getting a window size in order to position the window
on the screen, you should, instead, simply set the window’s semantic
type with `GtkWindowExt::set_type_hint`, which allows the window manager
to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
dialogs with `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` window managers will
often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred
to let the window manager handle these cases rather than doing it
yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and according to
user or system preferences, if the window manager handles it. Also,
the window manager can take into account the size of the window
decorations and border that it may add, and of which GTK+ has no
knowledge. Additionally, positioning windows in global screen coordinates
may not be allowed by the windowing system. For more information,
see: `GtkWindowExt::set_position`.
## `width`
return location for width, or `None`
## `height`
return location for height, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_title -->
Retrieves the title of the window. See `GtkWindowExt::set_title`.

# Returns

the title of the window, or `None` if none has
been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_titlebar -->
Returns the custom titlebar that has been set with
`GtkWindowExt::set_titlebar`.

# Returns

the custom titlebar, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_transient_for -->
Fetches the transient parent for this window. See
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`.

# Returns

the transient parent for this
window, or `None` if no transient parent has been set.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_type_hint -->
Gets the type hint for this window. See `GtkWindowExt::set_type_hint`.

# Returns

the type hint for `self`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_window_type -->
Gets the type of the window. See `WindowType`.

# Returns

the type of the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn has_group -->
Returns whether `self` has an explicit window group.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has an explicit window group.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn iconify -->
Asks to iconify (i.e. minimize) the specified `self`. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely iconified afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could deiconify it
again, or there may not be a window manager in which case
iconification isn’t possible, etc. But normally the window will end
up iconified. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be iconified before it ever appears
onscreen.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn is_active -->
Returns whether the window is part of the current active toplevel.
(That is, the toplevel window receiving keystrokes.)
The return value is `true` if the window is active toplevel itself.
You might use this function if you wanted to draw a widget
differently in an active window from a widget in an inactive window.

# Returns

`true` if the window part of the current active window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn is_maximized -->
Retrieves the current maximized state of `self`.

Note that since maximization is ultimately handled by the window
manager and happens asynchronously to an application request, you
shouldn’t assume the return value of this function changing
immediately (or at all), as an effect of calling
`GtkWindowExt::maximize` or `GtkWindowExt::unmaximize`.

# Returns

whether the window has a maximized state.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn maximize -->
Asks to maximize `self`, so that it becomes full-screen. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely maximized afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could unmaximize it
again, and not all window managers support maximization. But
normally the window will end up maximized. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be maximized when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property
or by listening to notifications on the `Window:is-maximized` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn mnemonic_activate -->
Activates the targets associated with the mnemonic.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `modifier`
the modifiers

# Returns

`true` if the activation is done.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn present -->
Presents a window to the user. This function should not be used
as when it is called, it is too late to gather a valid timestamp
to allow focus stealing prevention to work correctly.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn present_with_time -->
Presents a window to the user. This may mean raising the window
in the stacking order, deiconifying it, moving it to the current
desktop, and/or giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependent
on the user’s platform, window manager, and preferences.

If `self` is hidden, this function calls `WidgetExt::show`
as well.

This function should be used when the user tries to open a window
that’s already open. Say for example the preferences dialog is
currently open, and the user chooses Preferences from the menu
a second time; use `GtkWindowExt::present` to move the already-open dialog
where the user can see it.

Presents a window to the user in response to a user interaction. The
timestamp should be gathered when the window was requested to be shown
(when clicking a link for example), rather than once the window is
ready to be shown.
## `timestamp`
the timestamp of the user interaction (typically a
 button or key press event) which triggered this call
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn propagate_key_event -->
Propagate a key press or release event to the focus widget and
up the focus container chain until a widget handles `event`.
This is normally called by the default ::key_press_event and
::key_release_event handlers for toplevel windows,
however in some cases it may be useful to call this directly when
overriding the standard key handling for a toplevel window.
## `event`
a `gdk::EventKey`

# Returns

`true` if a widget in the focus chain handled the event.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn remove_accel_group -->
Reverses the effects of `GtkWindowExt::add_accel_group`.
## `accel_group`
a `AccelGroup`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn remove_mnemonic -->
Removes a mnemonic from this window.
## `keyval`
the mnemonic
## `target`
the widget that gets activated by the mnemonic
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn resize -->
Resizes the window as if the user had done so, obeying geometry
constraints. The default geometry constraint is that windows may
not be smaller than their size request; to override this
constraint, call `WidgetExt::set_size_request` to set the window's
request to a smaller value.

If `GtkWindowExt::resize` is called before showing a window for the
first time, it overrides any default size set with
`GtkWindowExt::set_default_size`.

Windows may not be resized smaller than 1 by 1 pixels.

When using client side decorations, GTK+ will do its best to adjust
the given size so that the resulting window size matches the
requested size without the title bar, borders and shadows added for
the client side decorations, but there is no guarantee that the
result will be totally accurate because these widgets added for
client side decorations depend on the theme and may not be realized
or visible at the time `GtkWindowExt::resize` is issued.

If the `Window` has a titlebar widget (see `GtkWindowExt::set_titlebar`), then
typically, `GtkWindowExt::resize` will compensate for the height of the titlebar
widget only if the height is known when the resulting `Window` configuration
is issued.
For example, if new widgets are added after the `Window` configuration
and cause the titlebar widget to grow in height, this will result in a
window content smaller that specified by `GtkWindowExt::resize` and not
a larger window.
## `width`
width in pixels to resize the window to
## `height`
height in pixels to resize the window to
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_accept_focus -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive
the input focus. This function sets this hint.
## `setting`
`true` to let this window receive input focus
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_application -->
Sets or unsets the `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it has any windows
associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold` for a way to keep it alive
without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window will remain
until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly remove it by setting
the `application` to `None`.

This is equivalent to calling `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window` and/or
`GtkApplicationExt::add_window` on the old/new applications as relevant.
## `application`
a `Application`, or `None` to unset
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_attached_to -->
Marks `self` as attached to `attach_widget`. This creates a logical binding
between the window and the widget it belongs to, which is used by GTK+ to
propagate information such as styling or accessibility to `self` as if it
was a children of `attach_widget`.

Examples of places where specifying this relation is useful are for instance
a `Menu` created by a `ComboBox`, a completion popup window
created by `Entry` or a typeahead search entry created by `TreeView`.

Note that this function should not be confused with
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`, which specifies a window manager relation
between two toplevels instead.

Passing `None` for `attach_widget` detaches the window.
## `attach_widget`
a `Widget`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_decorated -->
By default, windows are decorated with a title bar, resize
controls, etc. Some [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
allow GTK+ to disable these decorations, creating a
borderless window. If you set the decorated property to `false`
using this function, GTK+ will do its best to convince the window
manager not to decorate the window. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_default_size -->
Sets the default size of a window. If the window’s “natural” size
(its size request) is larger than the default, the default will be
ignored.

Unlike `WidgetExt::set_size_request`, which sets a size request for
a widget and thus would keep users from shrinking the window, this
function only sets the initial size, just as if the user had
resized the window themselves. Users can still shrink the window
again as they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to
use the “natural” default size (the size request of the window).

For some uses, `GtkWindowExt::resize` is a more appropriate function.
`GtkWindowExt::resize` changes the current size of the window, rather
than the size to be used on initial display. `GtkWindowExt::resize` always
affects the window itself, not the geometry widget.

The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size
it had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.

Windows can’t actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
passing 0 for `width` and `height` is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.

If you use this function to reestablish a previously saved window size,
note that the appropriate size to save is the one returned by
`GtkWindowExt::get_size`. Using the window allocation directly will not
work in all circumstances and can lead to growing or shrinking windows.
## `width`
width in pixels, or -1 to unset the default width
## `height`
height in pixels, or -1 to unset the default height
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_default_widget -->
The default widget is the widget that’s activated when the user
presses Enter in a dialog (for example). This function sets or
unsets the default widget for a `Window`.
## `default_widget`
widget to be the default, or `None`
 to unset the default widget for the toplevel
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_deletable -->
By default, windows have a close button in the window frame. Some
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] allow GTK+ to
disable this button. If you set the deletable property to `false`
using this function, GTK+ will do its best to convince the window
manager not to show a close button. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window as deletable
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_destroy_with_parent -->
If `setting` is `true`, then destroying the transient parent of `self`
will also destroy `self` itself. This is useful for dialogs that
shouldn’t persist beyond the lifetime of the main window they're
associated with, for example.
## `setting`
whether to destroy `self` with its transient parent
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_display -->
Sets the `gdk::Display` where the `self` is displayed; if
the window is already mapped, it will be unmapped, and
then remapped on the new display.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_focus -->
If `focus` is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets
it as the focus widget for the window. If `focus` is `None`, unsets
the focus widget for this window. To set the focus to a particular
widget in the toplevel, it is usually more convenient to use
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` instead of this function.
## `focus`
widget to be the new focus widget, or `None` to unset
 any focus widget for the toplevel window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_focus_on_map -->
Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive
the input focus when the window is mapped. This function sets this
hint.
## `setting`
`true` to let this window receive input focus on map
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_focus_visible -->
Sets the `Window:focus-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_has_user_ref_count -->
Tells GTK+ whether to drop its extra reference to the window
when `WidgetExt::destroy` is called.

This function is only exported for the benefit of language
bindings which may need to keep the window alive until their
wrapper object is garbage collected. There is no justification
for ever calling this function in an application.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_hide_on_close -->
If `setting` is `true`, then clicking the close button on the window
will not destroy it, but only hide it.
## `setting`
whether to hide the window when it is closed
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_icon_name -->
Sets the icon for the window from a named themed icon.
See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
On some platforms, the window icon is not used at all.

Note that this has nothing to do with the WM_ICON_NAME
property which is mentioned in the ICCCM.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_keep_above -->
Asks to keep `self` above, so that it stays on top. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely above afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could not keep it above,
and not all window managers support keeping windows above. But
normally the window will end kept above. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be kept above when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property

Note that, according to the
[Extended Window Manager Hints Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec),
the above state is mainly meant for user preferences and should not
be used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their
dialogs.
## `setting`
whether to keep `self` above other windows
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_keep_below -->
Asks to keep `self` below, so that it stays in bottom. Note that
you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely below afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could not keep it below,
and not all window managers support putting windows below. But
normally the window will be kept below. Just don’t write code
that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be kept below when it appears onscreen
initially.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property

Note that, according to the
[Extended Window Manager Hints Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec),
the above state is mainly meant for user preferences and should not
be used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their
dialogs.
## `setting`
whether to keep `self` below other windows
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_mnemonic_modifier -->
Sets the mnemonic modifier for this window.
## `modifier`
the modifier mask used to activate
 mnemonics on this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_mnemonics_visible -->
Sets the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets a window modal or non-modal. Modal windows prevent interaction
with other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogs
on top of main application windows, use
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` to make the dialog transient for the
parent; most [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
will then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
## `modal`
whether the window is modal
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_position -->
Sets a position constraint for this window. If the old or new
constraint is `WindowPosition::CenterAlways`, this will also cause
the window to be repositioned to satisfy the new constraint.
## `position`
a position constraint.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_resizable -->
Sets whether the user can resize a window. Windows are user resizable
by default.
## `resizable`
`true` if the user can resize this window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_startup_id -->
Startup notification identifiers are used by desktop environment to
track application startup, to provide user feedback and other
features. This function changes the corresponding property on the
underlying `gdk::Surface`. Normally, startup identifier is managed
automatically and you should only use this function in special cases
like transferring focus from other processes. You should use this
function before calling `GtkWindowExt::present` or any equivalent
function generating a window map event.

This function is only useful on X11, not with other GTK+ targets.
## `startup_id`
a string with startup-notification identifier
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `Window`. The title of a window will be
displayed in its title bar; on the X Window System, the title bar
is rendered by the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch],
so exactly how the title appears to users may vary
according to a user’s exact configuration. The title should help a
user distinguish this window from other windows they may have
open. A good title might include the application name and current
document filename, for example.
## `title`
title of the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_titlebar -->
Sets a custom titlebar for `self`.

A typical widget used here is `HeaderBar`, as it provides various features
expected of a titlebar while allowing the addition of child widgets to it.

If you set a custom titlebar, GTK+ will do its best to convince
the window manager not to put its own titlebar on the window.
Depending on the system, this function may not work for a window
that is already visible, so you set the titlebar before calling
`WidgetExt::show`.
## `titlebar`
the widget to use as titlebar
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_transient_for -->
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` and other convenience
functions in GTK+ will sometimes call
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` on your behalf.

Passing `None` for `parent` unsets the current transient window.

This function can also be used to attach a new
`WindowType::Popup` to a `WindowType::Toplevel` parent already mapped
on screen so that the `WindowType::Popup` will be
positioned relative to the `WindowType::Toplevel` surface.

On Windows, this function puts the child window on top of the parent,
much as the window manager would have done on X.
## `parent`
parent window, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_type_hint -->
By setting the type hint for the window, you allow the window
manager to decorate and handle the window in a way which is
suitable to the function of the window in your application.

This function should be called before the window becomes visible.

`Dialog::new_with_buttons` and other convenience functions in GTK+
will sometimes call `GtkWindowExt::set_type_hint` on your behalf.
## `hint`
the window type
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn stick -->
Asks to stick `self`, which means that it will appear on all user
desktops. Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely
stuck afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch] could unstick it
again, and some window managers do not support sticking
windows. But normally the window will end up stuck. Just don't
write code that crashes if not.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unfullscreen -->
Asks to toggle off the fullscreen state for `self`. Note that you
shouldn’t assume the window is definitely not full screen
afterward, because other entities (e.g. the user or
[window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could fullscreen it
again, and not all window managers honor requests to unfullscreen
windows. But normally the window will end up restored to its normal
state. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unmaximize -->
Asks to unmaximize `self`. Note that you shouldn’t assume the
window is definitely unmaximized afterward, because other entities
(e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch])
could maximize it again, and not all window
managers honor requests to unmaximize. But normally the window will
end up unmaximized. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unstick -->
Asks to unstick `self`, which means that it will appear on only
one of the user’s desktops. Note that you shouldn’t assume the
window is definitely unstuck afterward, because other entities
(e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could
stick it again. But normally the window will
end up stuck. Just don’t write code that crashes if not.

You can track iconification via the `gdk::Surface::state` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_activate_default -->
The ::activate-default signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user activates the default widget
of `window`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_activate_focus -->
The ::activate-focus signal is a
[keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user activates the currently
focused widget of `window`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_close_request -->
The ::close-request signal is emitted when the user clicks on the close
button of the window.

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the signal
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_enable_debugging -->
The ::enable-debugging signal is a [keybinding signal][`BindingSignal`]
which gets emitted when the user enables or disables interactive
debugging. When `toggle` is `true`, interactive debugging is toggled
on or off, when it is `false`, the debugger will be pointed at the
widget under the pointer.

The default bindings for this signal are Ctrl-Shift-I
and Ctrl-Shift-D.
## `toggle`
toggle the debugger

# Returns

`true` if the key binding was handled
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_keys_changed -->
The ::keys-changed signal gets emitted when the set of accelerators
or mnemonics that are associated with `window` changes.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_accept_focus -->
Whether the window should receive the input focus.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_accept_focus -->
Whether the window should receive the input focus.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_application -->
The `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it
has any windows associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold`
for a way to keep it alive without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it by setting the :application property to `None`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_application -->
The `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it
has any windows associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold`
for a way to keep it alive without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it by setting the :application property to `None`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_attached_to -->
The widget to which this window is attached.
See `GtkWindowExt::set_attached_to`.

Examples of places where specifying this relation is useful are
for instance a `Menu` created by a `ComboBox`, a completion
popup window created by `Entry` or a typeahead search entry
created by `TreeView`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_attached_to -->
The widget to which this window is attached.
See `GtkWindowExt::set_attached_to`.

Examples of places where specifying this relation is useful are
for instance a `Menu` created by a `ComboBox`, a completion

more details about transient windows.
<!-- struct WindowGroup -->
A `WindowGroup` restricts the effect of grabs to windows
in the same group, thereby making window groups almost behave
like separate applications.

A window can be a member in at most one window group at a time.
Windows that have not been explicitly assigned to a group are
implicitly treated like windows of the default window group.

`WindowGroup` objects are referenced by each window in the group,
so once you have added all windows to a `WindowGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the window group with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. If the
windows in the window group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the window group and drop their references on the window
group; when all window have been removed, the window group will be
freed.

<!-- enum WindowPosition -->
Window placement can be influenced using this enumeration. Note that
using `WindowPosition::CenterAlways` is almost always a bad idea.
It won’t necessarily work well with all window managers or on all windowing systems.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant None -->
No influence is made on placement.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant Center -->
Windows should be placed in the center of the screen.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant Mouse -->
Windows should be placed at the current mouse position.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant CenterAlways -->
Keep window centered as it changes size, etc.
<!-- enum WindowPosition::variant CenterOnParent -->
Center the window on its transient
 parent (see `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`).
<!-- enum WindowType -->
A `Window` can be one of these types. Most things you’d consider a
“window” should have type `WindowType::Toplevel`; windows with this type
are managed by the window manager and have a frame by default (call
`GtkWindowExt::set_decorated` to toggle the frame). Windows with type
`WindowType::Popup` are ignored by the window manager; window manager
keybindings won’t work on them, the window manager won’t decorate the
window with a frame, many GTK+ features that rely on the window
manager will not work (e.g. maximization/minimization).
`WindowType::Popup` is used to implement
widgets such as `Menu` or tooltips that you normally don’t think of
as windows per se. Nearly all windows should be `WindowType::Toplevel`.
In particular, do not use `WindowType::Popup` just to turn off
the window borders; use `GtkWindowExt::set_decorated` for that.
<!-- enum WindowType::variant Toplevel -->
A regular window, such as a dialog.
<!-- enum WindowType::variant Popup -->
A special window such as a tooltip.
<!-- enum WrapMode -->
Describes a type of line wrapping.
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant None -->
do not wrap lines; just make the text area wider
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant Char -->
wrap text, breaking lines anywhere the cursor can
 appear (between characters, usually - if you want to be technical,
 between graphemes, see `pango_get_log_attrs`)
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant Word -->
wrap text, breaking lines in between words
<!-- enum WrapMode::variant WordChar -->
wrap text, breaking lines in between words, or if
 that is not enough, also between graphemes
