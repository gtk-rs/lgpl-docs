<!-- struct ATContext -->
`ATContext` is an abstract class provided by GTK to communicate to
platform-specific assistive technologies API.

Each platform supported by GTK implements a `ATContext` subclass, and
is responsible for updating the accessible state in response to state
changes in `Accessible`.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl ATContext::fn create -->
Creates a new `ATContext` instance for the given accessible role,
accessible instance, and display connection.

The `ATContext` implementation being instantiated will depend on the
platform.
## `accessible_role`
the accessible role used by the `ATContext`
## `accessible`
the `Accessible` implementation using the `ATContext`
## `display`
the `gdk::Display` used by the `ATContext`

# Returns

the `ATContext`
<!-- impl ATContext::fn get_accessible -->
Retrieves the `Accessible` using this context.

# Returns

a `Accessible`
<!-- impl ATContext::fn get_accessible_role -->
Retrieves the accessible role of this context.

# Returns

a `AccessibleRole`
<!-- impl ATContext::fn connect_state_change -->
Emitted when the attributes of the accessible for the
`ATContext` instance change.
<!-- impl ATContext::fn get_property_accessible -->

<!-- impl ATContext::fn set_property_accessible -->
The `Accessible` that created the `ATContext` instance.
<!-- impl ATContext::fn get_property_accessible_role -->

Depending on the given role, different states and properties can be
set or retrieved.
<!-- impl ATContext::fn set_property_accessible_role -->
The accessible role used by the AT context.

Depending on the given role, different states and properties can be
set or retrieved.
<!-- impl ATContext::fn get_property_display -->
The `gdk::Display` for the `ATContext`.
<!-- impl ATContext::fn set_property_display -->
The `gdk::Display` for the `ATContext`.
<!-- struct AboutDialog -->
The `AboutDialog` offers a simple way to display information about
a program like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is
also possible to give credits to the authors, documenters, translators
and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically
opened when the user selects the `About` option from the `Help` menu.
All parts of the dialog are optional.

About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. `AboutDialog`
displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls `gtk_show_uri`
when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
`AboutDialog::activate-link` signal.

To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
"Edgar Allan Poe <edgar\@poe.com>". To specify a website with a title,
use a string like "GTK team http://www.gtk.org".

To make constructing a `AboutDialog` as convenient as possible, you can
use the function `gtk_show_about_dialog` which constructs and shows a dialog
and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.

Note that GTK sets a default title of `_("About %s")` on the dialog
window (where \%s is replaced by the name of the application, but in
order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
set the title property explicitly when constructing a `AboutDialog`,
as shown in the following example:

```C
GFile *logo_file = g_file_new_for_path ("./logo.png");
GdkTexture *example_logo = gdk_texture_new_from_file (logo_file, NULL);
g_object_unref (logo_file);

gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                       "program-name", "ExampleCode",
                       "logo", example_logo,
                       "title", _("About ExampleCode"),
                       NULL);
```

<!-- impl AboutDialog::fn set_translator_credits -->
Sets the translator credits string which is displayed in
the translators tab of the secondary credits dialog.

The intended use for this string is to display the translator
of the language which is currently used in the user interface.
Using `gettext`, a simple way to achieve that is to mark the
string for translation:

```C
GtkWidget *about = gtk_about_dialog_new ();
 gtk_about_dialog_set_translator_credits (GTK_ABOUT_DIALOG (about),
                                          _("translator-credits"));
```
It is a good idea to use the customary msgid “translator-credits” for this
purpose, since translators will already know the purpose of that msgid, and
since `AboutDialog` will detect if “translator-credits” is untranslated
and hide the tab.
## `translator_credits`
the translator credits

<!-- struct Accessible -->
`Accessible` provides an interface for describing a UI element, like a
`Widget`, in a way that can be consumed by Assistive Technologies, or
“AT”. Every accessible implementation has:

 - a “role”, represented by a value of the `AccessibleRole` enumeration
 - an “attribute”, represented by a set of `AccessibleState`,
 `AccessibleProperty` and `AccessibleRelation` values

The role cannot be changed after instantiating a `Accessible`
implementation.

The attributes are updated every time a UI element's state changes in a way that
should be reflected by assistive technologies. For instance, if a `Widget`
visibility changes, the `AccessibleState::Hidden` state will also change
to reflect the `Widget:visible` property.

It allows placing children at the start or the end. In addition, it
contains an internal centered box which is centered with respect to
the full width of the box, even if the children at either side take
up different amounts of space.

# CSS nodes

`ActionBar` has a single CSS node with name actionbar.

# Implements

<!-- impl ActionBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `ActionBar` widget.

# Returns

a new `ActionBar`
<!-- impl ActionBar::fn get_center_widget -->
Retrieves the center bar widget of the bar.

# Returns

the center `Widget` or `None`.
<!-- impl ActionBar::fn get_revealed -->
Gets the value of the `ActionBar:revealed` property.

# Returns

the current value of the `ActionBar:revealed` property.
<!-- impl ActionBar::fn pack_end -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
end of the `self`.
## `child`

<!-- impl ActionBar::fn set_center_widget -->
Sets the center widget for the `ActionBar`.
## `center_widget`

<!-- impl ActionBar::fn set_revealed -->
Sets the `ActionBar:revealed` property to `revealed`. Changing this will
make `self` reveal (`true`) or conceal (`false`) itself via a sliding
transition.

Note: this does not show or hide `self` in the `Widget:visible` sense,
so revealing has no effect if `Widget:visible` is `false`.
## `revealed`
The new value of the property
<!-- struct Actionable -->
This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with
actions on a `ApplicationWindow` or `Application`.

It primarily consists of two properties: `Actionable:action-name`
and `Actionable:action-target`. There are also some convenience APIs
for setting these properties.

The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the `ApplicationWindow`
or `Application`, but other action groups that are added with
`WidgetExt::insert_action_group` will be consulted as well.

# Implements

<!-- trait ActionableExt -->
Trait containing all `Actionable` methods.

# Implementors

<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_name -->
Gets the action name for `self`.

See `Actionable::set_action_name` for more information.

# Returns

the action name, or `None` if none is set
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn get_action_target_value -->
Gets the current target value of `self`.

See `Actionable::set_action_target_value` for more information.

# Returns

the current target value
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_name -->
Specifies the name of the action with which this widget should be
associated. If `action_name` is `None` then the widget will be
unassociated from any previous action.

Usually this function is used when the widget is located (or will be
located) within the hierarchy of a `ApplicationWindow`.

Names are of the form “win.save” or “app.quit” for actions on the
containing `ApplicationWindow` or its associated `Application`,
respectively. This is the same form used for actions in the `gio::Menu`
associated with the window.
## `action_name`
an action name, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target -->
Sets the target of an actionable widget.

This is a convenience function that calls `glib::Variant::new` for
`format_string` and uses the result to call
`Actionable::set_action_target_value`.

If you are setting a string-valued target and want to set the action
name at the same time, you can use
gtk_actionable_set_detailed_action_name ().
## `format_string`
a GVariant format string
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_action_target_value -->
Sets the target value of an actionable widget.

If `target_value` is `None` then the target value is unset.

The target value has two purposes. First, it is used as the
parameter to activation of the action associated with the
`Actionable` widget. Second, it is used to determine if the widget
should be rendered as “active” — the widget is active if the state
is equal to the given target.

Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a `gio::Action`
with string state in a typical “radio button” situation. Each button
will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
value for that action. Clicking on a particular button will activate
the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
the action’s state to change to that value. Since the action’s state
is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
rendered inactive).
## `target_value`
a `glib::Variant` to set as the target value, or `None`
<!-- trait ActionableExt::fn set_detailed_action_name -->
Sets the action-name and associated string target value of an
actionable widget.

`detailed_action_name` is a string in the format accepted by
`gio::Action::parse_detailed_name`.

(Note that prior to version 3.22.25,
this function is only usable for actions with a simple "s" target, and
`detailed_action_name` must be of the form `"action::target"` where
`action` is the action name and `target` is the string to use
as the target.)
## `detailed_action_name`
the detailed action name
<!-- struct ActivateAction -->
A `ShortcutAction` that calls `WidgetExt::activate`.

# Implements

[`ShortcutActionExt`](trait.ShortcutActionExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl ActivateAction::fn get -->
Gets the activate action. This is an action that calls `WidgetExt::activate`
on the given widget upon activation.

# Returns

The activate action
<!-- struct Adjustment -->
The `Adjustment` object represents a value which has an associated lower
and upper bound, together with step and page increments, and a page size.
It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including `SpinButton`, `Viewport`,
and `Range` (which is a base class for `Scrollbar` and `Scale`).

The `Adjustment` object does not update the value itself. Instead
it is left up to the owner of the `Adjustment` to control the value.

# Implements

[`AdjustmentExt`](trait.AdjustmentExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt -->
Trait containing all `Adjustment` methods.

# Implementors

[`Adjustment`](struct.Adjustment.html)
<!-- impl Adjustment::fn new -->
Creates a new `Adjustment`.
## `value`
the initial value
## `lower`
the minimum value
## `upper`
the maximum value
## `step_increment`
the step increment
## `page_increment`
the page increment
## `page_size`
the page size

# Returns

a new `Adjustment`
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn clamp_page -->
Updates the `Adjustment:value` property to ensure that the range
between `lower` and `upper` is in the current page (i.e. between
`Adjustment:value` and `Adjustment:value` + `Adjustment:page-size`).
If the range is larger than the page size, then only the start of it will
be in the current page.

A `Adjustment::value-changed` signal will be emitted if the value is changed.
## `lower`
the lower value
## `upper`
the upper value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn configure -->
Sets all properties of the adjustment at once.

Use this function to avoid multiple emissions of the
`Adjustment::changed` signal. See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower`
for an alternative way of compressing multiple emissions of
`Adjustment::changed` into one.
## `value`
the new value
## `lower`
the new minimum value
## `upper`
the new maximum value
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
## `page_size`
the new page size
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_lower -->
Retrieves the minimum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current minimum value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_minimum_increment -->
Gets the smaller of step increment and page increment.

# Returns

the minimum increment of `self`
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_page_increment -->
Retrieves the page increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page increment of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_page_size -->
Retrieves the page size of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current page size of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_step_increment -->
Retrieves the step increment of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current step increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_upper -->
Retrieves the maximum value of the adjustment.

# Returns

The current maximum value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the adjustment.
See `AdjustmentExt::set_value`.

# Returns

The current value of the adjustment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_lower -->
Sets the minimum value of the adjustment.

When setting multiple adjustment properties via their individual
setters, multiple `Adjustment::changed` signals will be emitted.
However, since the emission of the `Adjustment::changed` signal
is tied to the emission of the `gobject::Object::notify` signals of the changed
properties, it’s possible to compress the `Adjustment::changed`
signals into one by calling `gobject::ObjectExt::freeze_notify` and
`gobject::ObjectExt::thaw_notify` around the calls to the individual setters.

Alternatively, using a single `gobject::ObjectExt::set` for all the properties
to change, or using `AdjustmentExt::configure` has the same effect
of compressing `Adjustment::changed` emissions.
## `lower`
the new minimum value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_page_increment -->
Sets the page increment of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `page_increment`
the new page increment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_page_size -->
Sets the page size of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment`::changed signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `page_size`
the new page size
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_step_increment -->
Sets the step increment of the adjustment.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `step_increment`
the new step increment
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_upper -->
Sets the maximum value of the adjustment.

Note that values will be restricted by `upper - page-size`
if the page-size property is nonzero.

See `AdjustmentExt::set_lower` about how to compress multiple
emissions of the `Adjustment::changed` signal when setting
multiple adjustment properties.
## `upper`
the new maximum value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the `Adjustment` value. The value is clamped to lie between
`Adjustment:lower` and `Adjustment:upper`.

Note that for adjustments which are used in a `Scrollbar`, the
effective range of allowed values goes from `Adjustment:lower` to
`Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page-size`.
## `value`
the new value
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted when one or more of the `Adjustment` properties have been
changed, other than the `Adjustment:value` property.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
Emitted when the `Adjustment:value` property has been changed.

<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_page_increment -->
The page increment of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_page_size -->

if the adjustment is used for a simple scalar value, e.g. in a
`SpinButton`.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_page_size -->
The page size of the adjustment.
Note that the page-size is irrelevant and should be set to zero
if the adjustment is used for a simple scalar value, e.g. in a
`SpinButton`.

`upper - page-size` if the page-size
property is nonzero.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_upper -->

Note that values will be restricted by
`upper - page-size` if the page-size
property is nonzero.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn get_property_value -->
The value of the adjustment.
<!-- trait AdjustmentExt::fn set_property_value -->
The value of the adjustment.
<!-- enum Align -->
Controls how a widget deals with extra space in a single (x or y)
dimension.

Alignment only matters if the widget receives a “too large” allocation,
for example if you packed the widget with the `Widget:hexpand`
property inside a `Box`, then the widget might get extra space.
If you have for example a 16x16 icon inside a 32x32 space, the icon
could be scaled and stretched, it could be centered, or it could be
positioned to one side of the space.

Note that in horizontal context `Align::Start` and `Align::End`
are interpreted relative to text direction.

`Align::Baseline` support is optional for containers and widgets, and
it is only supported for vertical alignment. When it's not supported by
a child or a container it is treated as `Align::Fill`.
<!-- enum Align::variant Fill -->
stretch to fill all space if possible, center if

<!-- struct AppChooser -->
`AppChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by widgets which
allow the user to choose an application (typically for the purpose of
opening a file). The main objects that implement this interface are
`AppChooserWidget`, `AppChooserDialog` and `AppChooserButton`.

Applications are represented by GIO `gio::AppInfo` objects here.
GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
knows the default and last-used application for a given content
type. The `AppChooserWidget` provides detailed control over
whether the shown list of applications should include default,
recommended or fallback applications.

To obtain the application that has been selected in a `AppChooser`,
use `AppChooser::get_app_info`.

<!-- trait AppChooserExt::fn set_property_content_type -->
The content type of the `AppChooser` object.

See [GContentType][gio-GContentType]
for more information about content types.
<!-- struct AppChooserButton -->
The `AppChooserButton` is a widget that lets the user select
an application. It implements the `AppChooser` interface.

Initially, a `AppChooserButton` selects the first application
in its list, which will either be the most-recently used application
or, if `AppChooserButton:show-default-item` is `true`, the
default application.

The list of applications shown in a `AppChooserButton` includes
the recommended applications for the given content type. When
`AppChooserButton:show-default-item` is set, the default application
is also included. To let the user chooser other applications,
you can set the `AppChooserButton:show-dialog-item` property,
which allows to open a full `AppChooserDialog`.

It is possible to add custom items to the list, using
`AppChooserButton::append_custom_item`. These items cause
the `AppChooserButton::custom-item-activated` signal to be
emitted when they are selected.

To track changes in the selected application, use the
`AppChooserButton::changed` signal.

`AppChooserWidget` is a widget for selecting applications.
It is the main building block for `AppChooserDialog`. Most
applications only need to use the latter; but you can use
this widget as part of a larger widget if you have special needs.

`AppChooserWidget` offers detailed control over what applications
are shown, using the
`AppChooserWidget:show-default`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-recommended`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-fallback`,
`AppChooserWidget:show-other` and
`AppChooserWidget:show-all`
properties. See the `AppChooser` documentation for more information
about these groups of applications.

To keep track of the selected application, use the
`AppChooserWidget::application-selected` and `AppChooserWidget::application-activated` signals.

<!-- struct Application -->
`Application` is a class that handles many important aspects
of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
a one-size-fits-all application model.

Currently, `Application` handles GTK initialization, application
uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
life-cycle of your application.

While `Application` works fine with plain ``GtkWindows``, it is recommended
to use it together with `ApplicationWindow`.

When GDK threads are enabled, `Application` will acquire the GDK
lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes. The GDK
lock is not touched for local action invocations. In order to have
actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
`gio::ActionGroup::activate_action`. The same applies to actions
associated with `ApplicationWindow` and to the “activate” and
“open” `gio::Application` methods.

## Automatic resources ## {`automatic`-resources}

`Application` will automatically load menus from the `Builder`
resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
resource base path (see `gio::ApplicationExt::set_resource_base_path`).
The menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
and accessed via `GtkApplicationExt::get_menu_by_id` which allows for
dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.

It is also possible to provide the menubar manually using
`GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

`Application` will also automatically setup an icon search path for
the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
resources. See `IconTheme::add_resource_path` for more
information.

If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
defines a `ShortcutsWindow` with ID "help_overlay" then `Application`
associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
`ApplicationWindow` and sets up the keyboard accelerator Control-?
to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.

## A simple application ## {`gtkapplication`}

[A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)

`Application` optionally registers with a session manager
of the users session (if you set the `Application:register-session`
property) and offers various functionality related to the session
life-cycle.

An application can block various ways to end the session with
the `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit` function. Typical use cases for
this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
session while inhibitors are present.

<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt -->
Trait containing all `Application` methods.

# Implementors

[`Application`](struct.Application.html)
<!-- impl Application::fn new -->
Creates a new `Application` instance.

When using `Application`, it is not necessary to call `gtk_init`
manually. It is called as soon as the application gets registered as
the primary instance.

Concretely, `gtk_init` is called in the default handler for the
`gio::Application::startup` signal. Therefore, `Application` subclasses should
chain up in their `gio::Application::startup` handler before using any GTK+ API.

Note that commandline arguments are not passed to `gtk_init`.
All GTK+ functionality that is available via commandline arguments
can also be achieved by setting suitable environment variables
such as `G_DEBUG`, so this should not be a big
problem. If you absolutely must support GTK+ commandline arguments,
you can explicitly call `gtk_init` before creating the application
instance.

If non-`None`, the application ID must be valid. See
`gio::Application::id_is_valid`.

If no application ID is given then some features (most notably application
uniqueness) will be disabled.
## `application_id`
The application ID.
## `flags`
the application flags

# Returns

a new `Application` instance
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn add_window -->
Adds a window to `self`.

This call can only happen after the `self` has started;
typically, you should add new application windows in response
to the emission of the `gio::Application::activate` signal.

This call is equivalent to setting the `Window:application`
property of `window` to `self`.

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it with `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window`.

GTK+ will keep the `self` running as long as it has
any windows.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_accels_for_action -->
Gets the accelerators that are currently associated with
the given action.
## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to obtain accelerators for

# Returns

accelerators for `detailed_action_name`, as
 a `None`-terminated array. Free with `g_strfreev` when no longer needed
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_actions_for_accel -->
Returns the list of actions (possibly empty) that `accel` maps to.
Each item in the list is a detailed action name in the usual form.

This might be useful to discover if an accel already exists in
order to prevent installation of a conflicting accelerator (from
an accelerator editor or a plugin system, for example). Note that
having more than one action per accelerator may not be a bad thing
and might make sense in cases where the actions never appear in the
same context.

In case there are no actions for a given accelerator, an empty array
is returned. `None` is never returned.

It is a programmer error to pass an invalid accelerator string.
If you are unsure, check it with `gtk_accelerator_parse` first.
## `accel`
an accelerator that can be parsed by `gtk_accelerator_parse`

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of actions for `accel`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_active_window -->
Gets the “active” window for the application.

The active window is the one that was most recently focused (within
the application). This window may not have the focus at the moment
if another application has it — this is just the most
recently-focused window within this application.

# Returns

the active window, or `None` if
 there isn't one.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_menu_by_id -->
Gets a menu from automatically loaded resources.
See [Automatic resources][automatic-resources]
for more information.
## `id`
the id of the menu to look up

# Returns

Gets the menu with the
 given id from the automatically loaded resources
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_menubar -->
Returns the menu model that has been set with
`GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

# Returns

the menubar for windows of `self`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_window_by_id -->
Returns the `ApplicationWindow` with the given ID.

The ID of a `ApplicationWindow` can be retrieved with
`ApplicationWindowExt::get_id`.
## `id`
an identifier number

# Returns

the window with ID `id`, or
 `None` if there is no window with this ID
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_windows -->
Gets a list of the ``GtkWindows`` associated with `self`.

The list is sorted by most recently focused window, such that the first
element is the currently focused window. (Useful for choosing a parent
for a transient window.)

The list that is returned should not be modified in any way. It will
only remain valid until the next focus change or window creation or
deletion.

# Returns

a `glib::List` of `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn inhibit -->
Inform the session manager that certain types of actions should be
inhibited. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and for
all types of actions.

Applications should invoke this method when they begin an operation
that should not be interrupted, such as creating a CD or DVD. The
types of actions that may be blocked are specified by the `flags`
parameter. When the application completes the operation it should
call `GtkApplicationExt::uninhibit` to remove the inhibitor. Note that
an application can have multiple inhibitors, and all of them must
be individually removed. Inhibitors are also cleared when the
application exits.

Applications should not expect that they will always be able to block
the action. In most cases, users will be given the option to force
the action to take place.

Reasons should be short and to the point.

If `window` is given, the session manager may point the user to
this window to find out more about why the action is inhibited.
## `window`
a `Window`, or `None`
## `flags`
what types of actions should be inhibited
## `reason`
a short, human-readable string that explains
 why these operations are inhibited

# Returns

A non-zero cookie that is used to uniquely identify this
 request. It should be used as an argument to `GtkApplicationExt::uninhibit`
 in order to remove the request. If the platform does not support
 inhibiting or the request failed for some reason, 0 is returned.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn list_action_descriptions -->
Lists the detailed action names which have associated accelerators.
See `GtkApplicationExt::set_accels_for_action`.

# Returns

a `None`-terminated array of strings,
 free with `g_strfreev` when done
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn remove_window -->
Remove a window from `self`.

If `window` belongs to `self` then this call is equivalent to
setting the `Window:application` property of `window` to
`None`.

The application may stop running as a result of a call to this
function.
## `window`
a `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_accels_for_action -->
Sets zero or more keyboard accelerators that will trigger the
given action. The first item in `accels` will be the primary
accelerator, which may be displayed in the UI.

To remove all accelerators for an action, use an empty, zero-terminated
array for `accels`.

For the `detailed_action_name`, see `gio::Action::parse_detailed_name` and
`gio::Action::print_detailed_name`.
## `detailed_action_name`
a detailed action name, specifying an action
 and target to associate accelerators with
## `accels`
a list of accelerators in the format
 understood by `gtk_accelerator_parse`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_menubar -->
Sets or unsets the menubar for windows of `self`.

This is a menubar in the traditional sense.

This can only be done in the primary instance of the application,
after it has been registered. `gio::Application::startup` is a good place
to call this.

Depending on the desktop environment, this may appear at the top of
each window, or at the top of the screen. In some environments, if
both the application menu and the menubar are set, the application
menu will be presented as if it were the first item of the menubar.
Other environments treat the two as completely separate — for example,
the application menu may be rendered by the desktop shell while the
menubar (if set) remains in each individual window.

Use the base `gio::ActionMap` interface to add actions, to respond to the
user selecting these menu items.
## `menubar`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn uninhibit -->
Removes an inhibitor that has been established with `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit`.
Inhibitors are also cleared when the application exits.
## `cookie`
a cookie that was returned by `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_query_end -->
Emitted when the session manager is about to end the session, only
if `Application:register-session` is `true`. Applications can
connect to this signal and call `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit` with
`ApplicationInhibitFlags::Logout` to delay the end of the session
until state has been saved.
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_window_added -->
Emitted when a `Window` is added to `application` through
`GtkApplicationExt::add_window`.
## `window`
the newly-added `Window`
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn connect_window_removed -->
Emitted when a `Window` is removed from `application`,
either as a side-effect of being destroyed or explicitly
through `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window`.
## `window`
the `Window` that is being removed
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_property_register_session -->
Set this property to `true` to register with the session manager.
This will make GTK+ track the session state (such as the
`Application:screensaver-active` property).
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn set_property_register_session -->
Set this property to `true` to register with the session manager.
This will make GTK+ track the session state (such as the
`Application:screensaver-active` property).
<!-- trait GtkApplicationExt::fn get_property_screensaver_active -->
This property is `true` if GTK+ believes that the screensaver is
currently active. GTK+ only tracks session state (including this)
when `Application:register-session` is set to `true`.

Tracking the screensaver state is supported on Linux.
<!-- struct ApplicationInhibitFlags -->
Types of user actions that may be blocked by `GtkApplicationExt::inhibit`.
<!-- struct ApplicationInhibitFlags::const LOGOUT -->
Inhibit ending the user session
 by logging out or by shutting down the computer
<!-- struct ApplicationInhibitFlags::const SWITCH -->
Inhibit user switching
<!-- struct ApplicationInhibitFlags::const SUSPEND -->
Inhibit suspending the
 session or computer
<!-- struct ApplicationInhibitFlags::const IDLE -->
Inhibit the session being
 marked as idle (and possibly locked)
<!-- struct ApplicationWindow -->
`ApplicationWindow` is a `Window` subclass that offers some
extra functionality for better integration with `Application`
features. Notably, it can handle an application menubar.
See `GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.

This class implements the `gio::ActionGroup` and `gio::ActionMap` interfaces,
to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
associated `Application`, together with its application-wide
actions. Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
referring to them from a `gio::MenuModel`.

Note that widgets that are placed inside a `ApplicationWindow`
can also activate these actions, if they implement the
`Actionable` interface.

As with `Application`, the GDK lock will be acquired when
processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore
be held when activating actions locally (if GDK threads are enabled).

The settings `Settings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu` and
`Settings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar` tell GTK+ whether the
desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
on Windows neither will be. gnome-shell (starting with version 3.4)
will display the application menu, but not the menubar.

If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
`ApplicationWindow` will automatically show a menubar for it.
This behaviour can be overridden with the `ApplicationWindow:show-menubar`
property. If the desktop environment does not display the application
menu, then it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the
windows client-side decorations.

See `PopoverMenu` for information about the XML language
used by `Builder` for menu models.

<!-- struct AspectFrame -->
The `AspectFrame` is useful when you want
pack a widget so that it can resize but always retains
the same aspect ratio. For instance, one might be
drawing a small preview of a larger image. `AspectFrame`
derives from `Frame`, so it can draw a label and
a frame around the child. The frame will be
“shrink-wrapped” to the size of the child.

# CSS nodes

`AspectFrame` uses a CSS node with name frame.

<!-- struct Assistant -->
A `Assistant` is a widget used to represent a generally complex
operation split up into several steps. Each step consists of one or more
pages. `Assistant` guides the user through the pages, and controls
the page flow to collect the data needed for the operation.

`Assistant` handles which buttons to show and to make sensitive based
on page sequence knowledge and the [type][`AssistantPageType`]
of each page in addition to state information like the
[completion][gtk-assistant-set-page-complete]
and [committed][gtk-assistant-commit] page statuses.

If you have a case that doesn’t quite fit in ``GtkAssistants`` way of
handling buttons, you can use the `AssistantPageType::Custom` page
type and handle buttons yourself.

`Assistant` maintains a `AssistantPage` object for each added
child, which holds additional per-child properties. You
obtain the `AssistantPage` for a child with `Assistant::get_page`.

# `Assistant` as `Buildable`

The `Assistant` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
exposes the `action_area` as internal children with the name
“action_area”.

To add pages to an assistant in `Builder`, simply add it as a
child to the `Assistant` object. If you need to set per-object
properties, create a `AssistantPage` object explicitly, and
set the child widget as a property on it.

# CSS nodes

`Assistant` has a single CSS node with the name window and style
class .assistant.

Erases the visited page history so the back button is not
shown on the current page, and removes the cancel button
from subsequent pages.

Use this when the information provided up to the current
page is hereafter deemed permanent and cannot be modified
or undone. For example, showing a progress page to track
a long-running, unreversible operation after the user has
clicked apply on a confirmation page.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn get_current_page -->

 or -1 to append the page to the `self`

# Returns

the index (starting from 0) of the inserted page
<!-- impl Assistant::fn next_page -->

It is a programming error to call this function when
there is no next page.

This function is for use when creating pages of the
`AssistantPageType::Custom` type.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn prepend_page -->
Prepends a page to the `self`.
## `page`
a `Widget`

# Returns

the index (starting at 0) of the inserted page

## `page_num`
the index of a page in the `self`,
 or -1 to remove the last page
<!-- impl Assistant::fn set_current_page -->
Switches the page to `page_num`.

Note that this will only be necessary in custom buttons,
as the `self` flow can be set with
`Assistant::set_forward_page_func`.
## `page_num`
index of the page to switch to, starting from 0.
 If negative, the last page will be used. If greater
 than the number of pages in the `self`, nothing
 will be done.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn set_forward_page_func -->
Sets the page forwarding function to be `page_func`.

This function will be used to determine what will be
the next page when the user presses the forward button.
Setting `page_func` to `None` will make the assistant to
use the default forward function, which just goes to the
next visible page.

the ``GtkAssistantPageFunc``, or `None`
 to use the default one
## `data`
user data for `page_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`
<!-- impl Assistant::fn set_page_complete -->

<!-- impl Assistant::fn update_buttons_state -->
Forces `self` to recompute the buttons state.

GTK automatically takes care of this in most situations,
e.g. when the user goes to a different page, or when the
visibility or completeness of a page changes.

One situation where it can be necessary to call this
function is when changing a value on the current page
affects the future page flow of the assistant.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn connect_apply -->
The ::apply signal is emitted when the apply button is clicked.

The default behavior of the `Assistant` is to switch to the page
after the current page, unless the current page is the last one.

A handler for the ::apply signal should carry out the actions for
which the wizard has collected data. If the action takes a long time
to complete, you might consider putting a page of type
`AssistantPageType::Progress` after the confirmation page and handle
this operation within the `Assistant::prepare` signal of the progress
page.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn connect_cancel -->
The ::cancel signal is emitted when then the cancel button is clicked.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is emitted either when the close button of
a summary page is clicked, or when the apply button in the last
page in the flow (of type `AssistantPageType::Confirm`) is clicked.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn connect_escape -->
The action signal for the Escape binding.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn connect_prepare -->
The ::prepare signal is emitted when a new page is set as the
assistant's current page, before making the new page visible.

A handler for this signal can do any preparations which are
necessary before showing `page`.
## `page`
the current page
<!-- impl Assistant::fn get_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the assistant uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- impl Assistant::fn set_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the assistant uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- struct AssistantPage -->


# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn get_child -->
Returns the child to which `self` belongs.

# Returns

the child to which `self` belongs
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn get_property_complete -->
Setting the "complete" property to `true` marks a page as
complete (i.e.: all the required fields are filled out). GTK uses
this information to control the sensitivity of the navigation buttons.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn set_property_complete -->
Setting the "complete" property to `true` marks a page as
complete (i.e.: all the required fields are filled out). GTK uses
this information to control the sensitivity of the navigation buttons.

The type of the assistant page.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn set_property_page_type -->
The type of the assistant page.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn get_property_title -->
The title of the page.
<!-- impl AssistantPage::fn set_property_title -->
The title of the page.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType -->
An enum for determining the page role inside the `Assistant`. It's
used to handle buttons sensitivity and visibility.

Note that an assistant needs to end its page flow with a page of type
`AssistantPageType::Confirm`, `AssistantPageType::Summary` or
`AssistantPageType::Progress` to be correct.

The Cancel button will only be shown if the page isn’t “committed”.
See `Assistant::commit` for details.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Content -->
The page has regular contents. Both the
 Back and forward buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Intro -->
The page contains an introduction to the
 assistant task. Only the Forward button will be shown if there is a
 next page.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Confirm -->
The page lets the user confirm or deny the
 changes. The Back and Apply buttons will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Summary -->
The page informs the user of the changes
 done. Only the Close button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Progress -->
Used for tasks that take a long time to
 complete, blocks the assistant until the page is marked as complete.
 Only the back button will be shown.
<!-- enum AssistantPageType::variant Custom -->
Used for when other page types are not
 appropriate. No buttons will be shown, and the application must
 add its own buttons through `Assistant::add_action_widget`.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition -->
Whenever a container has some form of natural row it may align
children in that row along a common typographical baseline. If
the amount of vertical space in the row is taller than the total
requested height of the baseline-aligned children then it can use a
`BaselinePosition` to select where to put the baseline inside the
extra available space.
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Top -->
Align the baseline at the top
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Center -->
Center the baseline
<!-- enum BaselinePosition::variant Bottom -->
Align the baseline at the bottom
<!-- struct BinLayout -->
`BinLayout` is a `LayoutManager` subclass useful for create "bins" of
widgets. `BinLayout` will stack each child of a widget on top of each
other, using the `Widget:hexpand`, `Widget:vexpand`, `Widget:halign`,
and `Widget:valign` properties of each child to determine where they
should be positioned.

# Implements

[`LayoutManagerExt`](trait.LayoutManagerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl BinLayout::fn new -->
Creates a new `BinLayout` instance.

# Returns

the newly created `BinLayout`
<!-- struct Bitset -->
`Bitset` is a data structure for representing a set of unsigned integers.
Another name for this data structure is "bitmap".

The current implementation is based on [roaring bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/).

A bitset allows adding a set of integers and provides support for set operations
like unions, intersections and checks for equality or if a value is contained
in the set. `Bitset` also contains various functions to query metadata about
the bitset, such as the minimum or maximum values or its size.

The fastest way to iterate values in a bitset is `BitsetIter`.

The main use case for `Bitset` is implementing complex selections for
`SelectionModel`.
<!-- impl Bitset::fn new_empty -->

and inside that grid, adds a rectangle with the given `width` and `height`.
## `start`
first value to add
## `width`
width of the rectangle
## `height`
height of the rectangle
## `stride`
row stride of the grid
<!-- impl Bitset::fn contains -->
Checks if the given `value` has been added to `self`
## `value`
the value to check

# Returns

`true` if `self` contains `value`
<!-- impl Bitset::fn copy -->

is set `self` to contain all values that were either contained in `self`
or in `other`, but not in both.

<!-- impl Bitset::fn get_size -->
Gets the number of values that were added to the set.
For example, if the set is empty, 0 is returned.

Note that this function returns a `guint64`, because when all values are
set, the return value is `G_MAXUINT` + 1. Unless you are sure this cannot
happen (it can't with `gio::ListModel`), be sure to use a 64bit type.

# Returns

The number of values in the set.
<!-- impl Bitset::fn get_size_in_range -->
Gets the number of values that are part of the set from `first` to `last`
(inclusive).

Note that this function returns a `guint64`, because when all values are

<!-- impl Bitset::fn splice -->
This is a support function for `gio::ListModel` handling, by mirroring
the `GlistModel::items-changed` signal.

First, it "cuts" the values from `position` to `removed` from
the bitset. That is, it removes all those values and shifts
all larger values to the left by `removed` places.

Then, it "pastes" new room into the bitset by shifting all values
larger than `position` by `added` spaces to the right. This frees
up space that can then be filled.

<!-- struct Box -->
The `Box` widget arranges child widgets into a single row or column,
depending upon the value of its `Orientable:orientation` property. Within
the other dimension, all children are allocated the same size. Of course,
the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties can be used on
the children to influence their allocation.

Use repeated calls to `BoxExt::append` to pack widgets into a `Box`
from start to end. Use `BoxExt::remove` to remove widgets from the `Box`.
`BoxExt::insert_child_after` can be used to add a child at a particular position.

Use `BoxExt::set_homogeneous` to specify whether or not all children
of the `Box` are forced to get the same amount of space.

Use `BoxExt::set_spacing` to determine how much space will be
minimally placed between all children in the `Box`. Note that
spacing is added between the children.

Use `BoxExt::reorder_child_after` to move a child to a different
place in the box.

# CSS nodes

`Box` uses a single CSS node with name box.

# Accessibility

`Box` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.

<!-- struct Buildable -->
`Buildable` allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization
from [`Builder` UI descriptions][BUILDER-UI].
The interface includes methods for setting names and properties of objects,
parsing custom tags and constructing child objects.

The `Buildable` interface is implemented by all widgets and
many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK. The
main user of this interface is `Builder`. There should be
very little need for applications to call any of these functions directly.

An object only needs to implement this interface if it needs to extend the
`Builder` format or run any extra routines at deserialization time.

<!-- struct Builder -->
A `Builder` is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
a `Builder` from a user interface description, call
`Builder::new_from_file`, `Builder::new_from_resource` or
`Builder::new_from_string`.

In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
descriptions from multiple sources to the same `Builder` you can
call `Builder::new` to get an empty builder and populate it by
(multiple) calls to `Builder::add_from_file`,
`Builder::add_from_resource` or `Builder::add_from_string`.

A `Builder` holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call `GtkWindowExt::destroy`
to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.

The functions `Builder::get_object` and `Builder::get_objects`
can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
with `GtkWindowExt::destroy`. Other widgets will either be part of a
larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
Non-widget objects need to be reffed with `gobject::ObjectExt::ref` to keep them
beyond the lifespan of the builder.

# `Builder` UI Definitions # {`BUILDER`-UI}

`Builder` parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
specified in XML format. We refer to these descriptions as “`Builder`
UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.

The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
calling `Builder::set_translation_domain` on the builder.
Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
`<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A `<child>`
element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
the only supported value is “gtk”) and the “version” attribute specifies
the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. The builder will error
out if the version requirements are not met.

Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
been loaded yet, GTK tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()` function
explicitly with the "type-func" attribute.

Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
application to retrieve them from the builder with `Builder::get_object`.
An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
parts of the UI definition. GTK reserves ids starting and ending
with `___` (three consecutive underscores) for its own purposes.

Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
`<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK uses
`gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
may help the translators.

`Builder` can parse textual representations for the most common
property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
as `true`, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
as `false`), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_INPUT_HINT_EMOJI|GTK_INPUT_HINT_LOWERCASE”)
and colors (in a format understood by `gdk::RGBA::parse`).

GVariants can be specified in the format understood by `g_variant_parse`,
and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.

Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
objects declared in the local XML fragment and objects exposed via
`Builder::expose_object`. In general, `Builder` allows forward
references to objects — declared in the local XML; an object doesn’t
have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
be used as the value of a construct-only property.

It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
property value using the attributes
"bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding, and
optionally, "bind-property" and "bind-flags" to specify the
source property and source binding flags respectively.
Internally builder implements this using `gobject::Binding` objects.
For more information see `gobject::ObjectExt::bind_property`

Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
been constructed by GTK as part of a composite widget, to set
properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the content area
of a `Dialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that `Builder`
still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
has already been constructed.

A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
(e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

# Signal handlers and function pointers

Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
specifies the function to connect to the signal.
The remaining attributes, “after”, “swapped” and “object”, have the
same meaning as the corresponding parameters of the
`g_signal_connect_object` or `g_signal_connect_data` functions. A
“last_modification_time” attribute is also allowed, but it does not
have a meaning to the builder.

If you rely on `gmodule::Module` support to lookup callbacks in the symbol table,
the following details should be noted:

When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
with `G_MODULE_EXPORT`, or they will not be put in the symbol table.
On Linux and Unices, this is not necessary; applications should instead
be compiled with the -Wl,--export-dynamic CFLAGS, and linked against
gmodule-export-2.0.

# A `Builder` UI Definition


```text
<interface>
  <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
    <child internal-child="vbox">
      <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1">
        <child internal-child="action_area">
          <object class="GtkBox" id="hbuttonbox1">
            <child>
              <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                <property name="label">gtk-ok</property>
                <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
```

Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their
own XML DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD
above. Note that a custom element in a `<child>` element gets parsed by
the custom tag handler of the parent object, while a custom element in
an `<object>` element gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.

These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the
respective objects.

Additionally, since 3.10 a special `<template>` tag has been added
to the format allowing one to define a widget class’s components.
See the [`Widget` documentation][composite-templates] for details.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuilderExtManual`](prelude/trait.BuilderExtManual.html)
<!-- impl Builder::fn new -->
Creates a new empty builder object.

This function is only useful if you intend to make multiple calls
to `Builder::add_from_file`, `Builder::add_from_resource`
or `Builder::add_from_string` in order to merge multiple UI
descriptions into a single builder.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`,
`Builder::new_from_resource` or `Builder::new_from_string`.

# Returns

a new (empty) `Builder` object
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_file -->
Builds the [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
in the file `filename`.

If there is an error opening the file or parsing the description then
the program will be aborted. You should only ever attempt to parse
user interface descriptions that are shipped as part of your program.
## `filename`
filename of user interface description file

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_resource -->
Builds the [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
at `resource_path`.

If there is an error locating the resource or parsing the
description, then the program will be aborted.
## `resource_path`
a `gio::Resource` resource path

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the described interface
<!-- impl Builder::fn new_from_string -->
Builds the user interface described by `string` (in the
[`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI] format).

If `string` is `None`-terminated, then `length` should be -1.
If `length` is not -1, then it is the length of `string`.

If there is an error parsing `string` then the program will be
aborted. You should not attempt to parse user interface description
from untrusted sources.
## `string`
a user interface (XML) description
## `length`
the length of `string`, or -1

# Returns

a `Builder` containing the interface described by `string`
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_from_file -->
Parses a file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_file`.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. You should not use this function with untrusted files (ie:
files that are not part of your application). Broken `Builder`
files can easily crash your program, and it’s possible that memory
was leaked leading up to the reported failure. The only reasonable
thing to do when an error is detected is to call `g_error`.
## `filename`
the name of the file to parse

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_from_resource -->
Parses a resource file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_resource`.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_RESOURCE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error`.
## `resource_path`
the path of the resource file to parse

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_from_string -->
Parses a string containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
and merges it with the current contents of `self`.

Most users will probably want to use `Builder::new_from_string`.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or
`G_VARIANT_PARSE_ERROR` domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error`.
## `buffer`
the string to parse
## `length`
the length of `buffer` (may be -1 if `buffer` is nul-terminated)

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_objects_from_file -->
Parses a file containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
building only the requested objects and merges
them with the current contents of `self`.

Upon errors 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `TreeView` that depends on its
`TreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.

domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `TreeView` that depends on its
`TreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.
## `resource_path`
the path of the resource file to parse
## `object_ids`
nul-terminated array of objects to build

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` if an error occurred
<!-- impl Builder::fn add_objects_from_string -->
Parses a string containing a [`Builder` UI definition][BUILDER-UI]
building only the requested objects and merges
them with the current contents of `self`.

 it could not be found in the object tree.
<!-- impl Builder::fn get_objects -->
Gets all objects that have been constructed by `self`. Note that
this function does not increment the reference counts of the returned
objects.

`Builder` has for that purpose. This is mainly used when
implementing the `Buildable` interface on a type.
## `type_name`
type name to lookup

# Returns

the `glib::Type` found for `type_name` or `G_TYPE_INVALID`
 if no type was found
<!-- impl Builder::fn set_current_object -->
Sets the current object for the `self`. The current object can be
thought of as the `this` object that the builder is working for and
will often be used as the default object when an object is optional.

`WidgetExt::init_template` for example will set the current object to
the widget the template is inited for.
For functions like `Builder::new_from_resource`, the current object
will be `None`.
## `current_object`
the new current object or
 `None` for none

This function demarshals a value from a string. This function
calls `gobject::Value::init` on the `value` argument, so it need not be
initialised beforehand.

This function can handle char, uchar, boolean, int, uint, long,
ulong, enum, flags, float, double, string, `gdk::RGBA` and
`Adjustment` type values. Support for `Widget` type values is
still to come.

<!-- impl Builder::fn value_from_string_type -->
Like `Builder::value_from_string`, this function demarshals
a value from a string, but takes a `glib::Type` instead of `gobject::ParamSpec`.
This function calls `gobject::Value::init` on the `value` argument, so it
need not be initialised beforehand.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`glib::Error` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.
## `type_`
the `glib::Type` of the value

If the translation domain is `None`, `Builder` uses `gettext`,
otherwise `g_dgettext`.
<!-- impl Builder::fn set_property_translation_domain -->
The translation domain used when translating property values that
have been marked as translatable in interface descriptions.
If the translation domain is `None`, `Builder` uses `gettext`,
otherwise `g_dgettext`.
<!-- struct BuilderClosureFlags -->
The list of flags that can be passed to `Builder::create_closure`.
New values may be added in the future for new features, so external
implementations of `BuilderScopeInterface` should test the flags for unknown
values and raise a `BuilderError::InvalidAttribute` error when they
encounter one.
<!-- struct BuilderClosureFlags::const SWAPPED -->
The closure should be created swapped. See
 `gobject::CClosure::new_swap` for details.
<!-- enum BuilderError -->
Error codes that identify various errors that can occur while using
`Builder`.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant InvalidTypeFunction -->
A type-func attribute didn’t name
 a function that returns a `glib::Type`.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant UnhandledTag -->
The input contained a tag that `Builder`
 can’t handle.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant MissingAttribute -->
An attribute that is required by
 `Builder` was missing.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant InvalidAttribute -->
`Builder` found an attribute that
 it doesn’t understand.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant InvalidTag -->

<!-- enum BuilderError::variant InvalidId -->
An object id is unknown.
<!-- enum BuilderError::variant InvalidFunction -->
A function could not be found. This often happens
 when symbols are set to be kept private. Compiling code with -rdynamic or using the
 `gmodule-export-2.0` pkgconfig module can fix this problem.
<!-- struct BuilderListItemFactory -->
`BuilderListItemFactory` is a `ListItemFactory` that creates
widgets by instantiating `Builder` UI templates. The templates
must be extending `ListItem`, and typically use ``GtkExpressions``
to obtain data from the items in the model.

Example:

```text
  <interface>
    <template class="GtkListItem">
      <property name="child">
        <object class="GtkLabel">
          <property name="xalign">0</property>
          <binding name="label">
            <lookup name="name" type="SettingsKey">
              <lookup name="item">GtkListItem</lookup>
            </lookup>
          </binding>
        </object>
      </property>

<!-- struct BuilderScope -->
`BuilderScope` is an interface to provide support to `Builder`, primarily
for looking up programming-language-specific values for strings that are
given in a `Builder` UI file.

The primary intended audience is bindings that want to provide deeper integration
of `Builder` into the language.

A `BuilderScope` instance may be used with multiple `Builder` objects, even
at once.

By default, GTK will use its own implementation of `BuilderScope` for the C
language which can be created via `BuilderCScope::new`.

`BuilderCScope` instances use symbols explicitly added to `builder`
with prior calls to `BuilderCScope::add_callback_symbol`. If developers want
to do that, they are encouraged to create their own scopes for that purpose.

In the case that symbols are not explicitly added; GTK will uses `gmodule::Module`’s
introspective features (by opening the module `None`) to look at the application’s
symbol table. From here it tries to match the signal function names given in the
interface description with symbols in the application.

Note that unless `BuilderCScope::add_callback_symbol` is called for
all signal callbacks which are referenced by the loaded XML, this
functionality will require that `gmodule::Module` be supported on the platform.

# Implements

[`BuilderScopeExt`](trait.BuilderScopeExt.html)
<!-- trait BuilderScopeExt -->
Trait containing all `BuilderScope` methods.

# Implementors

[`BuilderScope`](struct.BuilderScope.html)
<!-- struct Button -->
The `Button` widget is generally used to trigger a callback function that is
called when the button is pressed. The various signals and how to use them
are outlined below.

The `Button` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it can hold
almost any other standard `Widget`. The most commonly used child is the
`Label`.

# CSS nodes

`Button` has a single CSS node with name button. The node will get the
style classes .image-button or .text-button, if the content is just an
image or label, respectively. It may also receive the .flat style class.

Other style classes that are commonly used with `Button` include
.suggested-action and .destructive-action. In special cases, buttons
can be made round by adding the .circular style class.

Button-like widgets like `ToggleButton`, `MenuButton`, `VolumeButton`,
`LockButton`, `ColorButton` or `FontButton` use style classes such as
.toggle, .popup, .scale, .lock, .color on the button node
to differentiate themselves from a plain `Button`.

# Accessibility

`Button` uses the `AccessibleRole::Button` role.

# Implements

[`ButtonExt`](trait.ButtonExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html), [`ActionableExtManual`](prelude/trait.ActionableExtManual.html)

use `ButtonExt::set_child`.

# Returns

The newly created `Button` widget.
<!-- impl Button::fn new_from_icon_name -->
Creates a new button containing an icon from the current icon theme.

If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be

underscores). The first underlined character represents a keyboard
accelerator called a mnemonic.
Pressing Alt and that key activates the button.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `Button`
<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn get_child -->

<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from the label of the button, as set by
`ButtonExt::set_label`. If the label text has not
been set the return value will be `None`. This will be the
case if you create an empty button with `Button::new` to
use as a container.

# Returns

The text of the label widget. This string is owned
by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns whether an embedded underline in the button label indicates a
mnemonic. See `ButtonExt::set_use_underline`.

<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of the label of the button to `label`.

This will also clear any previously set labels.
## `label`

<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text of the button label indicates
the next character should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `use_underline`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal on `Button` is an action signal and
emitting it causes the button to animate press then release.
Applications should never connect to this signal, but use the
`Button::clicked` signal.
<!-- trait ButtonExt::fn connect_clicked -->
Emitted when the button has been activated (pressed and released).
<!-- enum ButtonsType -->
Prebuilt sets of buttons for the dialog. If
none of these choices are appropriate, simply use `ButtonsType::None`
then call `Dialog::add_buttons`.

<!-- struct Calendar -->
`Calendar` is a widget that displays a Gregorian calendar, one month
at a time. It can be created with `Calendar::new`.

The date that is currently displayed can be altered with
`Calendar::select_day`.

To place a visual marker on a particular day, use `Calendar::mark_day`
and to remove the marker, `Calendar::unmark_day`. Alternative, all
marks can be cleared with `Calendar::clear_marks`.

The selected date can be retrieved from a `Calendar` using
`Calendar::get_date`.

Users should be aware that, although the Gregorian calendar is the
legal calendar in most countries, it was adopted progressively
between 1582 and 1929. Display before these dates is likely to be
historically incorrect.

```

`Calendar` has a main node with name calendar. It contains a subnode called header
containing the widgets for switching between years and months.

The grid subnode contains all day labels, including week numbers on the left (marked
with the .week-number css class) and day names on top (marked with the .day-name
css class).

Day labels that belong to the previous or next month get the .other-month style class.
The label of the current day get the .today style class.

Marked day labels get the :selected state assigned.

<!-- struct CellArea -->
The `CellArea` is an abstract class for `CellLayout` widgets
(also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with an
arbitrary number of ``GtkCellRenderers`` and interact with the user
for a given `TreeModel` row.

The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
size requests and allocations for a given row of data.

Usually users dont have to interact with the `CellArea` directly
unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.

# Requesting area sizes

As outlined in
[`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management],
GTK uses a height-for-width
geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
interfaces. `CellArea` uses the same semantics to calculate the
size of an area for an arbitrary number of `TreeModel` rows.

When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
different layouting widgets. For instance a `TreeViewColumn`
always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a `IconView`
on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
areas when allocated less width.

It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
cells are different in each row). For this reason the `CellArea`
uses a `CellAreaContext` object to store the alignments
and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
with the said context).

The `CellAreaContext` is an opaque object specific to the
`CellArea` which created it (see `CellAreaExt::create_context`).
The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
However, it’s important that the same `CellAreaContext` which
was used to request the sizes for a given `TreeModel` row be
used when rendering or processing events for that row.

In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
int         minimum_width;
int         natural_width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
```

Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
in the accompanying `CellAreaContext` object and can be consulted
at any time.

This can be useful since `CellLayout` widgets usually have to
support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
exceedingly large amount of rows. The `CellLayout` widget in
that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
idle or timeout source (see `g_timeout_add`) and when the widget
is requested its actual width in `WidgetClass.measure`()
it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
`CellAreaContext` object.

A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:


```C
static void
foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget       *widget,
                         int             *minimum_size,
                         int             *natural_size)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;

  foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (foo);

  gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
}
```

In the above example the Foo widget has to make sure that some
row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that Foo judged
was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
the `CellAreaContext`.

Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
a similar task except in this case the `CellAreaContext` does not
store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
width which was requested by the `CellArea`).

In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
root level of a `TreeModel` one would do the following:


```C
GtkTreeIter iter;
int         minimum_height;
int         natural_height;
int         full_minimum_height = 0;
int         full_natural_height = 0;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
                                                  width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);

    if (width_is_for_allocation)
       cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);

    full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
    full_natural_height += natural_height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
allocation.

In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
who need to request size for tens of thousands of rows. For this
case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
call to `WidgetClass.measure`(). Returning
a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
values while more and more height is required for the row heights
that are calculated in the background.

# Rendering Areas

Once area sizes have been acquired at least for the rows in the
visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
`WidgetClass.snapshot`() time.

A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
runs as follows:


```C
GtkAllocation allocation;
GdkRectangle  cell_area = { 0, };
GtkTreeIter   iter;
int           minimum_width;
int           natural_width;

gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
cell_area.width = allocation.width;

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
while (valid)
  {
    cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);

    gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
    gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
                          &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);

    cell_area.y += cell_area.height;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
  }
```

Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
the time the widget is allocated using `gtk_distribute_natural_allocation`.

# Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus

Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
normal widget and then passing them to the `CellArea::event`
API as they come in. Usually `CellArea` is only interested in
button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
trigger the `CellArea::focus-changed` signal to fire; as well as
`CellArea::add-editable` in the case that an editable cell was
clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
`CellAreaExt::stop_editing` at any time to cancel any cell editing
that is currently in progress.

The `CellArea` drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
similar to `Widget`. For layouting widgets that support giving
focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass `CellRendererState::Focused`
to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
area to paint the focus at render time.

Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
`WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method. The layouting widget is always
responsible for knowing where `TreeModel` rows are rendered inside
the widget, so at `WidgetClass.focus`() time the layouting widget
should use the `CellArea` methods to navigate focus inside the area
and then observe the `DirectionType` to pass the focus to adjacent
rows and areas.

A basic example of how the `WidgetClass.focus`() virtual method
should be implemented:


```C
static gboolean
foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
           GtkDirectionType direction)
{
  Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
  FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
  int         focus_row;
  gboolean    have_focus = FALSE;

  focus_row = priv->focus_row;

  if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
    gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);

  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
  while (valid)
    {
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);

      if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
        {
           priv->focus_row = focus_row;
           have_focus = TRUE;
           break;
        }
      else
        {
          if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
              direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
            break;
          else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
                   direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
           {
              if (focus_row == 0)
                break;
              else
               {
                  focus_row--;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
               }
            }
          else
            {
              if (focus_row == last_row)
                break;
              else
                {
                  focus_row++;
                  valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return have_focus;
}
```

Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
`DirectionType` values to the way it lays out its cells.

# Cell Properties

The `CellArea` introduces cell properties for ``GtkCellRenderers``.
This provides some general interfaces for defining the relationship
cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a `CellAreaBox`
a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when the area is allocated
more than its full natural request, or a cell might be configured to “align”
with adjacent rows which were requested and rendered with the same
`CellAreaContext`.

Use `CellAreaClass::install_cell_property` to install cell
properties for a cell area class and `CellAreaClass::find_cell_property`
or `CellAreaClass::list_cell_properties` to get information about
existing cell properties.

To set the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_set_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_set` or `CellAreaExt::cell_set_valist`. To obtain
the value of a cell property, use `CellArea::cell_get_property`,
`CellAreaExt::cell_get` or `CellAreaExt::cell_get_valist`.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

applied `TreeIter`, this is implicitly updated when
`CellAreaExt::apply_attributes` is called and can be
used to interact with renderers from `CellArea`
subclasses.

Gets the `CellRenderer` which is expected to be focusable
for which `renderer` is, or may be a sibling.

This is handy for `CellArea` subclasses when handling events,
after determining the renderer at the event location it can

<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn get_preferred_height -->
Retrieves a cell area’s initial minimum and natural height.

`self` will store some geometrical information in `context` along the way;
when requesting sizes over an arbitrary number of rows, it’s not important

consult `CellAreaContextExt::get_preferred_height` after a series of
requests.
## `context`

`self` stores some geometrical information in `context` along the way
while calling `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`. It’s important to
perform a series of `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` requests with
`context` first and then call `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height_for_width`
on each cell area individually to get the height for width of each
fully requested row.

If at some point, the width of a single row changes, it should be
requested with `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` again and then
the full width of the requested rows checked again with
`CellAreaContextExt::get_preferred_width`.

## `sibling`
the `CellRenderer` to remove from `renderer`’s focus area
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn request_renderer -->
This is a convenience function for `CellArea` implementations
to request size for cell renderers. It’s important to use this
function to request size and then use `CellAreaExt::inner_cell_area`
at render and event time since this function will add padding
around the cell for focus painting.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to request size for
## `orientation`
the `Orientation` in which to request size
## `widget`
the `Widget` that `self` is rendering onto

location to store the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_size`
location to store the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn set_focus_cell -->
Explicitly sets the currently focused cell to `renderer`.

This is generally called by implementations of
`CellAreaClass.focus`() or `CellAreaClass.event`(),
however it can also be used to implement functions such
as `TreeViewExt::set_cursor_on_cell`.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to give focus to
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn snapshot -->

the `widget` relative coordinates for `self`
## `flags`
the `CellRendererState` for `self` in this row.
## `paint_focus`
whether `self` should paint focus on focused cells for focused rows or not.
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn stop_editing -->
Explicitly stops the editing of the currently edited cell.

If `canceled` is `true`, the currently edited cell renderer
will emit the ::editing-canceled signal, otherwise the
the ::editing-done signal will be emitted on the current
edit widget.

See `CellAreaExt::get_edited_cell` and `CellAreaExt::get_edit_widget`.
## `canceled`
whether editing was canceled.
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn connect_add_editable -->
Indicates that editing has started on `renderer` and that `editable`
should be added to the owning cell-layouting widget at `cell_area`.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` that started the edited
## `editable`
the `CellEditable` widget to add
## `cell_area`
the `Widget` relative `gdk::Rectangle` coordinates
 where `editable` should be added
## `path`
the `TreePath` string this edit was initiated for
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn connect_apply_attributes -->
This signal is emitted whenever applying attributes to `area` from `model`

the `TreeIter` indicating which row to apply the attributes of
## `is_expander`
whether the view shows children for this row

whether the view is currently showing the children of this row
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn connect_focus_changed -->
Indicates that focus changed on this `area`. This signal
is emitted either as a result of focus handling or event
handling.

It's possible that the signal is emitted even if the
currently focused renderer did not change, this is
because focus may change to the same renderer in the
same cell area for a different row of data.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` that has focus
## `path`
the current `TreePath` string set for `area`
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn connect_remove_editable -->
Indicates that editing finished on `renderer` and that `editable`
should be removed from the owning cell-layouting widget.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` that finished editeding
## `editable`
the `CellEditable` widget to remove
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn get_property_edit_widget -->
The widget currently editing the edited cell

This property is read-only and only changes as
a result of a call `CellArea::activate_cell`.
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn get_property_edited_cell -->

a result of a call `CellArea::activate_cell`.
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn get_property_focus_cell -->
The cell in the area that currently has focus
<!-- trait CellAreaExt::fn set_property_focus_cell -->
The cell in the area that currently has focus
<!-- struct CellAreaBox -->
The `CellAreaBox` renders cell renderers into a row or a column
depending on its `Orientation`.

`CellAreaBox` uses a notion of packing. Packing
refers to adding cell renderers with reference to a particular position
in a `CellAreaBox`. There are two reference positions: the
start and the end of the box.
When the `CellAreaBox` is oriented in the `Orientation::Vertical`
orientation, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
defined as the bottom. In the `Orientation::Horizontal` orientation
start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right
side.

Alignments of ``GtkCellRenderers`` rendered in adjacent rows can be
configured by configuring the `CellAreaBox` align child cell property
with `CellArea::cell_set_property` or by specifying the "align"
argument to `CellAreaBox::pack_start` and `CellAreaBox::pack_end`.

<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellAreaBox`.

# Returns

a newly created `CellAreaBox`
<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn get_spacing -->
Gets the spacing added between cell renderers.

# Returns

the space added between cell renderers in `self`.
<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn pack_end -->
Adds `renderer` to `self`, packed with reference to the end of `self`.

The `renderer` is packed after (away from end of) any other
`CellRenderer` packed with reference to the end of `self`.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to add
## `expand`
whether `renderer` should receive extra space when the area receives
more than its natural size
## `align`
whether `renderer` should be aligned in adjacent rows
## `fixed`
whether `renderer` should have the same size in all rows
<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn pack_start -->
Adds `renderer` to `self`, packed with reference to the start of `self`.

The `renderer` is packed after any other `CellRenderer` packed
with reference to the start of `self`.
## `renderer`
the `CellRenderer` to add

the space to add between ``GtkCellRenderers``
<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn get_property_spacing -->
The amount of space to reserve between cells.
<!-- impl CellAreaBox::fn set_property_spacing -->
The amount of space to reserve between cells.
<!-- struct CellAreaContext -->
The `CellAreaContext` object is created by a given `CellArea`
implementation via its `CellAreaClass.create_context`() virtual
method and is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
`TreeModel` rows that are requested and rendered in the same context.

`CellLayout` widgets can create any number of contexts in which to
request and render groups of data rows. However, it’s important that the
same context which was used to request sizes for a given `TreeModel`
row also be used for the same row when calling other `CellArea` APIs
such as `gtk_cell_area_render` and `CellArea::event`.

# Implements

[`CellAreaContextExt`](trait.CellAreaContextExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt -->
Trait containing all `CellAreaContext` methods.

# Implementors

[`CellAreaContext`](struct.CellAreaContext.html)
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn allocate -->
Allocates a width and/or a height for all rows which are to be
rendered with `self`.

Usually allocation is performed only horizontally or sometimes
vertically since a group of rows are usually rendered side by
side vertically or horizontally and share either the same width
or the same height. Sometimes they are allocated in both horizontal
and vertical orientations producing a homogeneous effect of the
rows. This is generally the case for `TreeView` when
`TreeView:fixed-height-mode` is enabled.
## `width`
the allocated width for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
## `height`
the allocated height for all `TreeModel` rows rendered
 with `self`, or -1.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_allocation -->
Fetches the current allocation size for `self`.

If the context was not allocated in width or height, or if the
context was recently reset with `CellAreaContextExt::reset`,
the returned value will be -1.
## `width`
location to store the allocated width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the allocated height, or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_area -->
Fetches the `CellArea` this `self` was created by.

This is generally unneeded by layouting widgets; however,
it is important for the context implementation itself to
fetch information about the area it is being used for.

For instance at `CellAreaContextClass.allocate`() time
it’s important to know details about any cell spacing
that the `CellArea` is configured with in order to
compute a proper allocation.

# Returns

the `CellArea` this context was created by.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for all rows which have been
requested with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are 0.
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height,
 or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_height_for_width -->
Gets the accumulative preferred height for `width` for all rows
which have been requested for the same said `width` with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `width`
a proposed width for allocation
## `minimum_height`
location to store the minimum height,
 or `None`
## `natural_height`
location to store the natural height,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_width -->
Gets the accumulative preferred width for all rows which have been
requested with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are 0.
## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width,
 or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_preferred_width_for_height -->
Gets the accumulative preferred width for `height` for all rows which
have been requested for the same said `height` with this context.

After `CellAreaContextExt::reset` is called and/or before ever
requesting the size of a `CellArea`, the returned values are -1.
## `height`
a proposed height for allocation
## `minimum_width`
location to store the minimum width,
 or `None`
## `natural_width`
location to store the natural width,
 or `None`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn push_preferred_height -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural height to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural height.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested height over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height` requests.
## `minimum_height`
the proposed new minimum height for `self`
## `natural_height`
the proposed new natural height for `self`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn push_preferred_width -->
Causes the minimum and/or natural width to grow if the new
proposed sizes exceed the current minimum and natural width.

This is used by `CellAreaContext` implementations during
the request process over a series of `TreeModel` rows to
progressively push the requested width over a series of
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width` requests.
## `minimum_width`
the proposed new minimum width for `self`
## `natural_width`
the proposed new natural width for `self`
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn reset -->
Resets any previously cached request and allocation
data.

When underlying `TreeModel` data changes its
important to reset the context if the content
size is allowed to shrink. If the content size
is only allowed to grow (this is usually an option
for views rendering large data stores as a measure
of optimization), then only the row that changed
or was inserted needs to be (re)requested with
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`.

When the new overall size of the context requires
that the allocated size changes (or whenever this
allocation changes at all), the variable row
sizes need to be re-requested for every row.

For instance, if the rows are displayed all with
the same width from top to bottom then a change
in the allocated width necessitates a recalculation
of all the displayed row heights using
`CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height_for_width`.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_area -->
The `CellArea` this context was created by
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn set_property_area -->
The `CellArea` this context was created by
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_minimum_height -->
The minimum height for the `CellArea` in this context
for all `TreeModel` rows that this context was requested
for using `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height`.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_minimum_width -->
The minimum width for the `CellArea` in this context
for all `TreeModel` rows that this context was requested
for using `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_natural_height -->
The natural height for the `CellArea` in this context
for all `TreeModel` rows that this context was requested
for using `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_height`.
<!-- trait CellAreaContextExt::fn get_property_natural_width -->
The natural width for the `CellArea` in this context
for all `TreeModel` rows that this context was requested
for using `CellAreaExt::get_preferred_width`.
<!-- struct CellEditable -->
The `CellEditable` interface must be implemented for widgets to be usable
to edit the contents of a `TreeView` cell. It provides a way to specify how
temporary widgets should be configured for editing, get the new value, etc.

Emits the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn remove_widget -->
Emits the `CellEditable::remove-widget` signal.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn start_editing -->
Begins editing on a `self`.

The `CellRenderer` for the cell creates and returns a `CellEditable` from
`CellRenderer::start_editing`, configured for the `CellRenderer` type.

`CellEditable::start_editing` can then set up `self` suitably for
editing a cell, e.g. making the Esc key emit `CellEditable::editing-done`.

Note that the `self` is created on-demand for the current edit; its
lifetime is temporary and does not persist across other edits and/or cells.
## `event`
The `gdk::Event` that began the editing process, or
 `None` if editing was initiated programmatically
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn connect_editing_done -->
This signal is a sign for the cell renderer to update its
value from the `cell_editable`.

Implementations of `CellEditable` are responsible for
emitting this signal when they are done editing, e.g.
`Entry` emits this signal when the user presses Enter. Typical things to
do in a handler for ::editing-done are to capture the edited value,
disconnect the `cell_editable` from signals on the `CellRenderer`, etc.

`CellEditable::editing_done` is a convenience method
for emitting `CellEditable::editing-done`.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn connect_remove_widget -->
This signal is meant to indicate that the cell is finished
editing, and the `cell_editable` widget is being removed and may
subsequently be destroyed.

Implementations of `CellEditable` are responsible for
emitting this signal when they are done editing. It must
be emitted after the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal,
to give the cell renderer a chance to update the cell's value
before the widget is removed.

`CellEditable::remove_widget` is a convenience method
for emitting `CellEditable::remove-widget`.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn get_property_editing_canceled -->
Indicates whether editing on the cell has been canceled.
<!-- trait CellEditableExt::fn set_property_editing_canceled -->
Indicates whether editing on the cell has been canceled.
<!-- struct CellLayout -->
`CellLayout` is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
want to provide a `TreeViewColumn` like API for packing cells,
setting attributes and data funcs.

One of the notable features provided by implementations of
`CellLayout` are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
tree model with `CellLayout::set_attributes`, which means that the value
of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
`CellLayout::set_cell_data_func` that is called to determine the
value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.

# `GtkCellLayouts` as `Buildable`

Implementations of `CellLayout` which also implement the `Buildable`
interface (`CellView`, `IconView`, `ComboBox`,
`EntryCompletion`, `TreeViewColumn`) accept `CellRenderer` objects
as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
attribute value.

This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:

```C
combo = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
```

to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
are only initialized after instance `init`
functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
the existence of the cell area in your subclass’ `init` function will
cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
you to the problem).


```C
static void
my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
{
  GtkCellRenderer *cell;

  cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();
  // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
  // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
  gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
  ...
}

GtkWidget *
my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
{
  // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
  return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
}
```

If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
problematic calls out of `init` and into a `constructor`
for your class.

<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`.

The `column` is the column of the model to get a value from, and the

example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from column 2.

is used by `self`.

# Returns

the cell area used by `self`,
or `None` in case no cell area is used.
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn get_cells -->
Returns the cell renderers which have been added to `self`.

# Returns


 a list of cell renderers. The list, but not the renderers has
 been newly allocated and should be freed with `glib::List::free`
 when no longer needed.
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to the end of `self`. If `expand` is `false`, then the
`cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is
divided evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of `self`. If `expand` is `false`,

is divided evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`

for this to function properly.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` to reorder
## `position`
new position to insert `cell` at
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn set_attributes -->
Sets the attributes in list as the attributes of `self`.

The attributes should be in attribute/column order, as in
`CellLayout::add_attribute`. All existing attributes are
removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
<!-- trait CellLayoutExt::fn set_cell_data_func -->
Sets the ``GtkCellLayoutDataFunc`` to use for `self`.

This function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping
for setting the column value, and should set the value of `self`’s
cell renderer(s) as appropriate.

`func` may be `None` to remove a previously set function.
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer`
## `func`
the ``GtkCellLayoutDataFunc`` to use, or `None`
## `func_data`
user data for `func`
## `destroy`
destroy notify for `func_data`
<!-- struct CellRenderer -->
The `CellRenderer` is a base class of a set of objects used for
rendering a cell to a `cairo::Context`. These objects are used primarily by
the `TreeView` widget, though they aren’t tied to them in any
specific way. It is worth noting that `CellRenderer` is not a
`Widget` and cannot be treated as such.

The primary use of a `CellRenderer` is for drawing a certain graphical
elements on a `cairo::Context`. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
draw many cells on the screen. To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
CellRenderer keep any permanent state around. Instead, any state is set
just prior to use using `GObjects` property system. Then, the
cell is measured using `CellRendererExt::get_preferred_size`. Finally, the cell
is rendered in the correct location using `CellRendererExt::snapshot`.

There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
`CellRenderer`. First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
barring a style change. The `CellRenderer` also has a number of
generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.

Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
“activatable” like `CellRendererToggle`,
which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
“editable” like `CellRendererText`, which
allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
`CellEditable` interface, e.g. `Entry`.
To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
implement the `CellRendererClass.activate` or
`CellRendererClass.start_editing` virtual functions, respectively.

Many properties of `CellRenderer` and its subclasses have a
corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

passed-in rectangles are areas in `cr`. Most renderers will draw within
`cell_area`; the xalign, yalign, xpad, and ypad fields of the `CellRenderer`
should be honored with respect to `cell_area`. `background_area` includes the
blank space around the cell, and also the area containing the tree expander;
so the `background_area` rectangles for all cells tile to cover the entire
`window`.
## `snapshot`
a `Snapshot` to draw to
## `widget`
the widget owning `window`
## `background_area`
entire cell area (including tree expanders and maybe
 padding on the sides)

# Returns

A new `CellEditable` for editing this
 `self`, or `None` if editing is not possible
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn stop_editing -->
Informs the cell renderer that the editing is stopped.
If `canceled` is `true`, the cell renderer will emit the
`CellRenderer::editing-canceled` signal.

This function should be called by cell renderer implementations
in response to the `CellEditable::editing-done` signal of
`CellEditable`.
## `canceled`
`true` if the editing has been canceled
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn connect_editing_canceled -->
This signal gets emitted when the user cancels the process of editing a
cell. For example, an editable cell renderer could be written to cancel
editing when the user presses Escape.

See also: `CellRendererExt::stop_editing`.
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn connect_editing_started -->
This signal gets emitted when a cell starts to be edited.
The intended use of this signal is to do special setup
on `editable`, e.g. adding a `EntryCompletion` or setting
up additional columns in a `ComboBox`.

See `CellEditable::start_editing` for information on the lifecycle of
the `editable` and a way to do setup that doesn’t depend on the `renderer`.

Note that GTK doesn't guarantee that cell renderers will
continue to use the same kind of widget for editing in future
releases, therefore you should check the type of `editable`
before doing any specific setup, as in the following example:

```C
static void
text_editing_started (GtkCellRenderer *cell,
                      GtkCellEditable *editable,
                      const char      *path,
                      gpointer         data)
{
  if (GTK_IS_ENTRY (editable))
    {
      GtkEntry *entry = GTK_ENTRY (editable);
      
      // ... create a GtkEntryCompletion
      
      gtk_entry_set_completion (entry, completion);
    }
}
```
## `editable`
the `CellEditable`
## `path`

<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn get_property_cell_background_rgba -->
Cell background as a `gdk::RGBA`
<!-- trait CellRendererExt::fn set_property_cell_background_rgba -->
Cell background as a `gdk::RGBA`
<!-- struct CellRendererAccel -->
`CellRendererAccel` displays a keyboard accelerator (i.e. a key
combination like `Control + a`). If the cell renderer is editable,
the accelerator can be changed by simply typing the new combination.

<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn get_property_accel_key -->
The keyval of the accelerator.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn set_property_accel_key -->
The keyval of the accelerator.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn get_property_accel_mode -->
Determines if the edited accelerators are GTK accelerators. If
they are, consumed modifiers are suppressed, only accelerators
accepted by GTK are allowed, and the accelerators are rendered
in the same way as they are in menus.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn set_property_accel_mode -->
Determines if the edited accelerators are GTK accelerators. If
they are, consumed modifiers are suppressed, only accelerators
accepted by GTK are allowed, and the accelerators are rendered
in the same way as they are in menus.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn get_property_accel_mods -->

<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn set_property_accel_mods -->
The modifier mask of the accelerator.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn get_property_keycode -->

only relevant if the key does not have a keyval. Normally, the keyboard
configuration should assign keyvals to all keys.
<!-- impl CellRendererAccel::fn set_property_keycode -->

only relevant if the key does not have a keyval. Normally, the keyboard
configuration should assign keyvals to all keys.

<!-- struct CellRendererCombo -->
`CellRendererCombo` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererCombo` offers a `ComboBox`
widget to edit the text. The values to display in the combo box are taken from
the tree model specified in the `CellRendererCombo:model` property.

The combo cell renderer takes care of adding a text cell renderer to the combo
box and sets it to display the column specified by its
`CellRendererCombo:text-column` property. Further properties of the combo box
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

# Implements

[`CellRendererTextExt`](trait.CellRendererTextExt.html), [`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`CellRendererExtManual`](prelude/trait.CellRendererExtManual.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererCombo`.
Adjust how text is drawn using object properties.
Object properties can be set globally (with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`).
Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you can bind a property to a value
in a `TreeModel`. For example, you can bind the “text” property
on the cell renderer to a string value in the model, thus rendering
a different string in each row of the `TreeView`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn connect_changed -->
This signal is emitted each time after the user selected an item in
the combo box, either by using the mouse or the arrow keys. Contrary
to `ComboBox`, `CellRendererCombo`::changed is not emitted for
changes made to a selected item in the entry. The argument `new_iter`
corresponds to the newly selected item in the combo box and it is relative
to the `TreeModel` set via the model property on `CellRendererCombo`.

Note that as soon as you change the model displayed in the tree view,
the tree view will immediately cease the editing operating. This
means that you most probably want to refrain from changing the model
until the combo cell renderer emits the edited or editing_canceled signal.
## `path_string`
a string of the path identifying the edited cell
 (relative to the tree view model)
## `new_iter`
the new iter selected in the combo box
 (relative to the combo box model)
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn get_property_has_entry -->
If `true`, the cell renderer will include an entry and allow to enter
values other than the ones in the popup list.
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn set_property_has_entry -->
If `true`, the cell renderer will include an entry and allow to enter
values other than the ones in the popup list.
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn get_property_model -->
Holds a tree model containing the possible values for the combo box.
Use the text_column property to specify the column holding the values.
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn set_property_model -->
Holds a tree model containing the possible values for the combo box.
Use the text_column property to specify the column holding the values.
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn get_property_text_column -->
Specifies the model column which holds the possible values for the
combo box.

Note that this refers to the model specified in the model property,
not the model backing the tree view to which
this cell renderer is attached.

`CellRendererCombo` automatically adds a text cell renderer for
this column to its combo box.
<!-- impl CellRendererCombo::fn set_property_text_column -->
Specifies the model column which holds the possible values for the
combo box.

Note that this refers to the model specified in the model property,
not the model backing the tree view to which
this cell renderer is attached.

`CellRendererCombo` automatically adds a text cell renderer for
this column to its combo box.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode -->
Identifies how the user can interact with a particular cell.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Inert -->
The cell is just for display
 and cannot be interacted with. Note that this doesn’t mean that eg. the
 row being drawn can’t be selected -- just that a particular element of
 it cannot be individually modified.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Activatable -->
The cell can be clicked.
<!-- enum CellRendererMode::variant Editable -->
The cell can be edited or otherwise modified.
<!-- struct CellRendererPixbuf -->
A `CellRendererPixbuf` can be used to render an image in a cell. It allows
to render either a given `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf` (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf` property) or a named icon (set via the
`CellRendererPixbuf:icon-name` property).

To support the tree view, `CellRendererPixbuf` also supports rendering two
alternative pixbufs, when the `CellRenderer:is-expander` property is `true`.
If the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `true` and the
`CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-open` property is set to a pixbuf, it
renders that pixbuf, if the `CellRenderer:is-expanded` property is `false`
and the `CellRendererPixbuf:pixbuf-expander-closed` property is set to a
pixbuf, it renders that one.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`CellRendererExtManual`](prelude/trait.CellRendererExtManual.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererPixbuf::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererPixbuf`. Adjust rendering
parameters using object properties. Object properties can be set
globally (with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you
can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example, you
can bind the “pixbuf” property on the cell renderer to a pixbuf value
in the model, thus rendering a different image in each row of the
`TreeView`.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- impl CellRendererPixbuf::fn get_property_gicon -->
The GIcon representing the icon to display.
If the icon theme is changed, the image will be updated
automatically.

The name of the themed icon to display.
This property only has an effect if not overridden by the "pixbuf" property.
<!-- impl CellRendererPixbuf::fn get_property_icon_size -->

<!-- impl CellRendererPixbuf::fn set_property_icon_size -->
The `IconSize` value that specifies the size of the rendered icon.
<!-- struct CellRendererProgress -->
`CellRendererProgress` renders a numeric value as a progress par in a cell.
Additionally, it can display a text on top of the progress bar.

<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererProgress`.

# Returns

<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn get_property_pulse -->
Setting this to a non-negative value causes the cell renderer to
enter "activity mode", where a block bounces back and forth to
indicate that some progress is made, without specifying exactly how
much.

Each increment of the property causes the block to move by a little
bit.

To indicate that the activity has not started yet, set the property
to zero. To indicate completion, set the property to `G_MAXINT`.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn set_property_pulse -->
Setting this to a non-negative value causes the cell renderer to
enter "activity mode", where a block bounces back and forth to
indicate that some progress is made, without specifying exactly how
much.

Each increment of the property causes the block to move by a little
bit.

To indicate that the activity has not started yet, set the property
to zero. To indicate completion, set the property to `G_MAXINT`.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn get_property_text -->
The "text" property determines the label which will be drawn
over the progress bar. Setting this property to `None` causes the default
label to be displayed. Setting this property to an empty string causes
no label to be displayed.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn set_property_text -->
The "text" property determines the label which will be drawn
over the progress bar. Setting this property to `None` causes the default
label to be displayed. Setting this property to an empty string causes
no label to be displayed.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn get_property_text_xalign -->
The "text-xalign" property controls the horizontal alignment of the
text in the progress bar. Valid values range from 0 (left) to 1
(right). Reserved for RTL layouts.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn set_property_text_xalign -->
The "text-xalign" property controls the horizontal alignment of the
text in the progress bar. Valid values range from 0 (left) to 1
(right). Reserved for RTL layouts.
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn get_property_text_yalign -->
The "text-yalign" property controls the vertical alignment of the
text in the progress bar. Valid values range from 0 (top) to 1
(bottom).
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn set_property_text_yalign -->
The "text-yalign" property controls the vertical alignment of the
text in the progress bar. Valid values range from 0 (top) to 1
(bottom).
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn get_property_value -->
The "value" property determines the percentage to which the
progress bar will be "filled in".
<!-- impl CellRendererProgress::fn set_property_value -->
The "value" property determines the percentage to which the
progress bar will be "filled in".
<!-- struct CellRendererSpin -->
`CellRendererSpin` renders text in a cell like `CellRendererText` from
which it is derived. But while `CellRendererText` offers a simple entry to
edit the text, `CellRendererSpin` offers a `SpinButton` widget. Of course,
that means that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.

The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the
cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the
tree model, like all properties of cell renders. `CellRendererSpin`
also has properties for the `CellRendererSpin:climb-rate` and the number
of `CellRendererSpin:digits` to display. Other `SpinButton` properties
can be set in a handler for the `CellRenderer::editing-started` signal.

The `CellRendererSpin` cell renderer was added in GTK 2.10.

`CellRendererSpinner` renders a spinning animation in a cell, very
similar to `Spinner`. It can often be used as an alternative
to a `CellRendererProgress` for displaying indefinite activity,
instead of actual progress.

To start the animation in a cell, set the `CellRendererSpinner:active`
property to `true` and increment the `CellRendererSpinner:pulse` property
at regular intervals. The usual way to set the cell renderer properties
for each cell is to bind them to columns in your tree model using e.g.
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`.

<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn new -->
Returns a new cell renderer which will show a spinner to indicate
activity.

# Returns

a new `CellRenderer`
<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn get_property_pulse -->
Pulse of the spinner. Increment this value to draw the next frame of the
spinner animation. Usually, you would update this value in a timeout.

By default, the `Spinner` widget draws one full cycle of the animation,
consisting of 12 frames, in 750 milliseconds.
<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn set_property_pulse -->
Pulse of the spinner. Increment this value to draw the next frame of the
spinner animation. Usually, you would update this value in a timeout.

By default, the `Spinner` widget draws one full cycle of the animation,
consisting of 12 frames, in 750 milliseconds.
<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn get_property_size -->
The `IconSize` value that specifies the size of the rendered spinner.
<!-- impl CellRendererSpinner::fn set_property_size -->

<!-- struct CellRendererState -->
Tells how a cell is to be rendered.
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const SELECTED -->
The cell is currently selected, and
 probably has a selection colored background to render to.
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const PRELIT -->
The mouse is hovering over the cell.
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const INSENSITIVE -->
The cell is drawn in an insensitive manner
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const SORTED -->
The cell is in a sorted row
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const FOCUSED -->
The cell is in the focus row.
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const EXPANDABLE -->
The cell is in a row that can be expanded
<!-- struct CellRendererState::const EXPANDED -->
The cell is in a row that is expanded
<!-- struct CellRendererText -->
A `CellRendererText` renders a given text in its cell, using the font, color and
style information provided by its properties. The text will be ellipsized if it is
too long and the `CellRendererText:ellipsize` property allows it.

If the `CellRenderer:mode` is `CellRendererMode::Editable`,
the `CellRendererText` allows to edit its text using an entry.

<!-- impl CellRendererText::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererText`. Adjust how text is drawn using
object properties. Object properties can be
set globally (with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`,
you can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example,
you can bind the “text” property on the cell renderer to a string
value in the model, thus rendering a different string in each row
of the `TreeView`

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_fixed_height_from_font -->
Sets the height of a renderer to explicitly be determined by the “font” and
“y_pad” property set on it. Further changes in these properties do not
affect the height, so they must be accompanied by a subsequent call to this
function. Using this function is inflexible, and should really only be used
if calculating the size of a cell is too slow (ie, a massive number of cells
displayed). If `number_of_rows` is -1, then the fixed height is unset, and
the height is determined by the properties again.
## `number_of_rows`
Number of rows of text each cell renderer is allocated, or -1
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn connect_edited -->
This signal is emitted after `renderer` has been edited.

It is the responsibility of the application to update the model
and store `new_text` at the position indicated by `path`.
## `path`
the path identifying the edited cell
## `new_text`
the new text
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn get_property_alignment -->
Specifies how to align the lines of text with respect to each other.

Note that this property describes how to align the lines of text in
case there are several of them. The "xalign" property of `CellRenderer`,
on the other hand, sets the horizontal alignment of the whole text.
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_property_alignment -->
Specifies how to align the lines of text with respect to each other.

Note that this property describes how to align the lines of text in
case there are several of them. The "xalign" property of `CellRenderer`,

Background color as a `gdk::RGBA`
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn get_property_ellipsize -->
Specifies the preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the cell renderer
does not have enough room to display the entire string. Setting it to
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` turns off ellipsizing. See the wrap-width property
for another way of making the text fit into a given width.
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_property_ellipsize -->
Specifies the preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the cell renderer
does not have enough room to display the entire string. Setting it to

The desired maximum width of the cell, in characters. If this property
is set to -1, the width will be calculated automatically.

For cell renderers that ellipsize or wrap text; this property
controls the maximum reported width of the cell. The
cell should not receive any greater allocation unless it is
set to expand in its `CellLayout` and all of the cell's siblings
have received their natural width.
<!-- trait CellRendererTextExt::fn set_property_max_width_chars -->

<!-- struct CellRendererToggle -->
`CellRendererToggle` renders a toggle button in a cell. The
button is drawn as a radio or a checkbutton, depending on the
`CellRendererToggle:radio` property.
When activated, it emits the `CellRendererToggle::toggled` signal.

# Implements

[`CellRendererExt`](trait.CellRendererExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`CellRendererExtManual`](prelude/trait.CellRendererExtManual.html)
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn new -->
Creates a new `CellRendererToggle`. Adjust rendering
parameters using object properties. Object properties can be set
globally (with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`). Also, with `TreeViewColumn`, you
can bind a property to a value in a `TreeModel`. For example, you
can bind the “active” property on the cell renderer to a boolean value
in the model, thus causing the check button to reflect the state of
the model.

# Returns

the new cell renderer
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn get_activatable -->
Returns whether the cell renderer is activatable. See
`CellRendererToggle::set_activatable`.

# Returns

Returns whether the cell renderer is active. See
`CellRendererToggle::set_active`.

# Returns

`true` if the cell renderer is active.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn get_radio -->
Returns whether we’re rendering radio toggles rather than checkboxes.

# Returns

## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn set_active -->
Activates or deactivates a cell renderer.
## `setting`
the value to set.
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn set_radio -->
If `radio` is `true`, the cell renderer renders a radio toggle
(i.e. a toggle in a group of mutually-exclusive toggles).
If `false`, it renders a check toggle (a standalone boolean option).
This can be set globally for the cell renderer, or changed just
before rendering each cell in the model (for `TreeView`, you set
up a per-row setting using `TreeViewColumn` to associate model
columns with cell renderer properties).
## `radio`
`true` to make the toggle look like a radio button
<!-- impl CellRendererToggle::fn connect_toggled -->
The ::toggled signal is emitted when the cell is toggled.

It is the responsibility of the application to update the model
with the correct value to store at `path`. Often this is simply the
opposite of the value currently stored at `path`.
## `path`
string representation of `TreePath` describing the
 event location
<!-- struct CellView -->
A `CellView` displays a single row of a `TreeModel` using a `CellArea`
and `CellAreaContext`. A `CellAreaContext` can be provided to the
`CellView` at construction time in order to keep the cellview in context
of a group of cell views, this ensures that the renderers displayed will
be properly aligned with each other (like the aligned cells in the menus
of `ComboBox`).

`CellView` is `Orientable` in order to decide in which orientation
the underlying `CellAreaContext` should be allocated. Taking the `ComboBox`
menu as an example, cellviews should be oriented horizontally if the menus are
listed top-to-bottom and thus all share the same width but may have separate
individual heights (left-to-right menus should be allocated vertically since
they all share the same height but may have variable widths).

# CSS nodes

`CellView` has a single CSS node with name cellview.

<!-- struct CenterBox -->
The `CenterBox` widget arranges three children in a horizontal
or vertical arrangement, keeping the middle child centered as well
as possible.

To add children to `CenterBox`, use `CenterBox::set_start_widget`,
`CenterBox::set_center_widget` and `CenterBox::set_end_widget`.

The sizing and positioning of children can be influenced with the
align and expand properties of the children.

# `CenterBox` as `Buildable`

The `CenterBox` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing children in the 3 positions by specifying “start”, “center” or
“end” as the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

# CSS nodes

`CenterBox` uses a single CSS node with the name “box”,

The first child of the `CenterBox` will be allocated depending on the
text direction, i.e. in left-to-right layouts it will be allocated on the
left and in right-to-left layouts on the right.

In vertical orientation, the nodes of the children are arranged from top to
bottom.

# Accessibility

`CenterBox` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.

```

A `CheckButton` has a main node with name checkbutton. If the
`CheckButton:label` property is set, it contains a label child.
The indicator node is named check when no group is set, and radio
if the checkbutton is grouped together with other checkbuttons.

<!-- impl CheckButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `CheckButton` with a `Label` next to it, if
`label` is non-`None`.
## `label`
the text for the check button.

# Returns

a new `CheckButton`
<!-- impl CheckButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `CheckButton` containing a label. Underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the check button.
## `label`
The text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `CheckButton`
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn get_active -->
Returns the current value of the `CheckButton:active` property.

# Returns

The value of the `CheckButton:active` property.
 See `CheckButtonExt::set_active` for details on how to set a new value.
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn get_inconsistent -->
Returns whether the check button is in an inconsistent state.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is currently in an 'in between' state, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn get_label -->
Returns the label of the checkbutton.

# Returns

The label `self` shows next to the indicator.
 If no label is shown, `None` will be returned.
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns the current value of the `CheckButton:use-underline` property.

# Returns

The value of the `CheckButton:use-underline` property.
 See `CheckButtonExt::set_use_underline` for details on how to set a new value.
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn set_active -->
Sets the new value of the `CheckButton:active` property.
See also `CheckButtonExt::get_active`.

Setting `CheckButton:active` to `true` will add the `:checked:` state to
both the checkbutton and the indicator CSS node.
## `setting`
the new value to set
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn set_group -->
Adds `self` to the group of `group`. In a group of multiple check buttons,
only one button can be active at a time.

Setting the group of a check button also changes the css name of the
indicator widget's CSS node to 'radio'.

The behavior of a checkbutton in a group is also commonly known as
a 'radio button'.

Note that the same effect can be achieved via the `Actionable`
api, by using the same action with parameter type and state type 's'
for all buttons in the group, and giving each button its own target
value.
## `group`
another `CheckButton` to
 form a group with
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn set_inconsistent -->
If the user has selected a range of elements (such as some text or
spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a check button, and the
current values in that range are inconsistent, you may want to
display the toggle in an "in between" state. Normally you would
turn off the inconsistent state again if the user checks the
check button. This has to be done manually,
gtk_check_button_set_inconsistent only affects visual appearance,
not the semantics of the button.
## `inconsistent`
`true` if state is inconsistent
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of `self`. If `CheckButton:use-underline` is `true`,
the underscore in `label` is interpreted as mnemonic indicator,
see `CheckButtonExt::set_use_underline` for details on this behavior.
## `label`
The text shown next to the indicator, or `None`
 to show no text
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn set_use_underline -->
Sets the new value of the `CheckButton:use-underline` property.
See also `CheckButtonExt::get_use_underline`.

If `setting` is `true`, an underscore character in `self`'s label indicates
a mnemonic accelerator key. This behavior is similar to `Label:use-underline`.
## `setting`
the new value to set
<!-- trait CheckButtonExt::fn connect_toggled -->
Emitted when the buttons's `CheckButton:active` flag changes.
<!-- struct ColorButton -->
The `ColorButton` is a button which displays the currently selected
color and allows to open a color selection dialog to change the color.
It is suitable widget for selecting a color in a preference dialog.

`ColorButton` has a single CSS node with name colorbutton which
contains a button node. To differentiate it from a plain `Button`,
it gets the .color style class.

<!-- impl ColorButton::fn new -->
Creates a new color button.

This returns a widget in the form of a small button containing
a swatch representing the current selected color. When the button
is clicked, a color-selection dialog will open, allowing the user
to select a color. The swatch will be updated to reflect the new
color when the user finishes.

<!-- impl ColorButton::fn connect_color_set -->
The ::color-set signal is emitted when the user selects a color.
When handling this signal, use `ColorChooser::get_rgba` to
find out which color was just selected.

Note that this signal is only emitted when the user
changes the color. If you need to react to programmatic color changes
as well, use the notify::color signal.
<!-- impl ColorButton::fn get_property_show_editor -->
Set this property to `true` to skip the palette
in the dialog and go directly to the color editor.

This property should be used in cases where the palette
in the editor would be redundant, such as when the color
button is already part of a palette.
<!-- impl ColorButton::fn set_property_show_editor -->
Set this property to `true` to skip the palette
in the dialog and go directly to the color editor.

This property should be used in cases where the palette

<!-- struct ColorChooser -->
`ColorChooser` is an interface that is implemented by widgets
for choosing colors. Depending on the situation, colors may be
allowed to have alpha (translucency).

In GTK, the main widgets that implement this interface are
`ColorChooserWidget`, `ColorChooserDialog` and `ColorButton`.

# Implements

[`ColorChooserExt`](trait.ColorChooserExt.html), [`ColorChooserExtManual`](prelude/trait.ColorChooserExtManual.html)
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt -->
Trait containing all `ColorChooser` methods.

<!-- trait ColorChooserExtManual::fn add_palette -->
Adds a palette to the color chooser. If `orientation` is horizontal,
the colors are grouped in rows, with `colors_per_line` colors
in each row. If `horizontal` is `false`, the colors are grouped
in columns instead.

The default color palette of `ColorChooserWidget` has
27 colors, organized in columns of 3 colors. The default gray
palette has 9 grays in a single row.

The layout of the color chooser widget works best when the
palettes have 9-10 columns.

Calling this function for the first time has the
side effect of removing the default color and gray palettes
from the color chooser.

If `colors` is `None`, removes all previously added palettes.
## `orientation`
`Orientation::Horizontal` if the palette should
 be displayed in rows, `Orientation::Vertical` for columns
## `colors_per_line`
the number of colors to show in each row/column
## `n_colors`
the total number of elements in `colors`
## `colors`
the colors of the palette, or `None`
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_rgba -->
Gets the currently-selected color.
## `color`
a `gdk::RGBA` to fill in with the current color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_use_alpha -->
Returns whether the color chooser shows the alpha channel.

# Returns

`true` if the color chooser uses the alpha channel,
 `false` if not
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_rgba -->
Sets the color.
## `color`
the new color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_use_alpha -->
Sets whether or not the color chooser should use the alpha channel.
## `use_alpha`
`true` if color chooser should use alpha channel, `false` if not
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn connect_color_activated -->
Emitted when a color is activated from the color chooser.
This usually happens when the user clicks a color swatch,
or a color is selected and the user presses one of the keys
Space, Shift+Space, Return or Enter.
## `color`
the color
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_property_rgba -->
The ::rgba property contains the currently selected color,
as a `gdk::RGBA` struct. The property can be set to change
the current selection programmatically.
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_property_rgba -->
The ::rgba property contains the currently selected color,
as a `gdk::RGBA` struct. The property can be set to change
the current selection programmatically.
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn get_property_use_alpha -->
When ::use-alpha is `true`, colors may have alpha (translucency)
information. When it is `false`, the `gdk::RGBA` struct obtained
via the `ColorChooser:rgba` property will be forced to have
alpha == 1.

Implementations are expected to show alpha by rendering the color
over a non-uniform background (like a checkerboard pattern).
<!-- trait ColorChooserExt::fn set_property_use_alpha -->
When ::use-alpha is `true`, colors may have alpha (translucency)
information. When it is `false`, the `gdk::RGBA` struct obtained
via the `ColorChooser:rgba` property will be forced to have
alpha == 1.

Implementations are expected to show alpha by rendering the color
over a non-uniform background (like a checkerboard pattern).
<!-- struct ColorChooserDialog -->
The `ColorChooserDialog` widget is a dialog for choosing
a color. It implements the `ColorChooser` interface.

<!-- impl ColorChooserDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new `ColorChooserDialog`.
## `title`
Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`

# Returns

a new `ColorChooserDialog`
<!-- struct ColorChooserWidget -->
The `ColorChooserWidget` widget lets the user select a
color. By default, the chooser presents a predefined palette
of colors, plus a small number of settable custom colors.
It is also possible to select a different color with the
single-color editor. To enter the single-color editing mode,
use the context menu of any color of the palette, or use the
'+' button to add a new custom color.

The chooser automatically remembers the last selection, as well
as custom colors.

To change the initially selected color, use `ColorChooser::set_rgba`.
To get the selected color use `ColorChooser::get_rgba`.

The `ColorChooserWidget` is used in the `ColorChooserDialog`
to provide a dialog for selecting colors.

<!-- struct ColumnView -->
`ColumnView` is a widget to present a view into a large dynamic list of items
using multiple columns with headers.

`ColumnView` uses the factories of its columns to generate a cell widget for
each column, for each visible item and displays them together as the row for
this item. The `ColumnView:show-row-separators` and
`ColumnView:show-column-separators` properties offer a simple way to display
separators between the rows or columns.

`ColumnView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
it is possible to turn on *rubberband selection*, using
`ColumnView:enable-rubberband`.

The column view supports sorting that can be customized by the user by
clicking on column headers. To set this up, the `Sorter` returned by
`ColumnView::get_sorter` must be attached to a sort model for the data
that the view is showing, and the columns must have sorters attached to them
by calling `ColumnViewColumn::set_sorter`. The initial sort order can be
set with `ColumnView::sort_by_column`.

The column view also supports interactive resizing and reordering of
columns, via Drag-and-Drop of the column headers. This can be enabled or
disabled with the `ColumnView:reorderable` and `ColumnViewColumn:resizable`
properties.

To learn more about the list widget framework, see the [overview](`ListWidget`).

# CSS nodes


```plain
columnview[.column-separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar][.data-table]
├── header
│   ├── <column header>
┊   ┊
│   ╰── <column header>
│
├── listview
│
┊
╰── [rubberband]

```

`ColumnView` uses a single CSS node named columnview. It may carry the
.column-separators style class, when `ColumnView:show-column-separators`
property is set. Header widets appear below a node with name header.
The rows are contained in a `ListView` widget, so there is a listview
node with the same structure as for a standalone `ListView` widget. If
`ColumnView:show-row-separators` is set, it will be passed on to the
list view, causing its CSS node to carry the .separators style class.
For rubberband selection, a node with name rubberband is used.

The main columnview node may also carry style classes to select
the style of [list presentation](ListContainers.html`list`-styles):
.rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

# Accessibility

`ColumnView` uses the `AccessibleRole::TreeGrid` role, header title
widgets are using the `AccessibleRole::ColumnHeader` role. The row widgets
are using the `AccessibleRole::Row` role, and individual cells are using
the `AccessibleRole::GridCell` role

 `ColumnView` yet
<!-- impl ColumnView::fn get_columns -->
Gets the list of columns in this column view. This list is constant over
the lifetime of `self` and can be used to monitor changes to the columns
of `self` by connecting to the `gio::ListModel:items-changed` signal.

# Returns

`true` if rows are activated on single click
<!-- impl ColumnView::fn get_sorter -->
Returns a special sorter that reflects the users sorting
choices in the column view.

To allow users to customizable sorting by clicking on column
headers, this sorter needs to be set on the sort model underneath
the model that is displayed by the view.

See `ColumnViewColumn::set_sorter` for setting up
per-column sorting.

Here is an example:

```text
  gtk_column_view_column_set_sorter (column, sorter);
  gtk_column_view_append_column (view, column);
  sorter = g_object_ref (gtk_column_view_get_sorter (view)));
  model = gtk_sort_list_model_new (store, sorter);

<!-- impl ColumnView::fn sort_by_column -->
Sets the sorting of the view.

This function should be used to set up the initial sorting. At runtime,
users can change the sorting of a column view by clicking on the list headers.

This call only has an effect if the sorter returned by `ColumnView::get_sorter`
is set on a sort model, and `ColumnViewColumn::set_sorter` has been called
on `column` to associate a sorter with the column.

If `column` is `None`, the view will be unsorted.

<!-- struct ComboBox -->
A `ComboBox` is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
valid choices. The `ComboBox` displays the selected choice. When
activated, the `ComboBox` displays a popup which allows the user to
make a new choice. The style in which the selected value is displayed,
and the style of the popup is determined by the current theme. It may
be similar to a Windows-style combo box.

The `ComboBox` uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
would in a tree view. This is possible since `ComboBox` implements the
`CellLayout` interface. The tree model holding the valid choices is
not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the popup will
reflect the tree structure.

To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the “has-entry”
property allows the `ComboBox` to contain a `Entry`. This entry
can be accessed by calling `ComboBoxExt::get_child` on the combo box.

For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of `ComboBox`
can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, `ComboBoxText` offers a
simple alternative. Both `ComboBox` and `ComboBoxText` can contain
an entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
combobox
├── box.linked

│       ╰── box
│           ├── cellview
│           ╰── arrow
╰── window.popup
```

A normal combobox contains a box with the .linked class, a button
with the .combo class and inside those buttons, there are a cellview and
an arrow.


```plain
combobox
├── box.linked
│   ├── entry.combo
│   ╰── button.combo
│       ╰── box
│           ╰── arrow
╰── window.popup
```

A `ComboBox` with an entry has a single CSS node with name combobox. It
contains a box with the .linked class. That box contains an entry and a
button, both with the .combo class added.
The button also contains another node with name arrow.

Returns the index of the currently active item, or -1 if there’s no
active item. If the model is a non-flat treemodel, and the active item
is not an immediate child of the root of the tree, this function returns
`gtk_tree_path_get_indices (path)[0]`, where
`path` is the `TreePath` of the active item.

# Returns

An integer which is the index of the currently active item,
 or -1 if there’s no active item.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn get_active_id -->
Returns the ID of the active row of `self`. This value is taken
from the active row and the column specified by the `ComboBox:id-column`
property of `self` (see `ComboBoxExt::set_id_column`).

The returned value is an interned string which means that you can
compare the pointer by value to other interned strings and that you

with an entry.
<!-- trait ComboBoxExt::fn connect_format_entry_text -->
For combo boxes that are created with an entry (See `ComboBox`:has-entry).

A signal which allows you to change how the text displayed in a combo box's
entry is displayed.

`path`. That string will then be used to set the text in the combo box's entry.
The default signal handler uses the text from the `ComboBox`::entry-text-column
model column.

Here's an example signal handler which fetches data from the model and
displays it in the entry.

```C
static char *
format_entry_text_callback (GtkComboBox *combo,
                            const char *path,

{
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  GtkTreeModel model;
  double       value;

  model = gtk_combo_box_get_model (combo);

<!-- struct ComboBoxText -->
A `ComboBoxText` is a simple variant of `ComboBox` that hides
the model-view complexity for simple text-only use cases.

To create a `ComboBoxText`, use `ComboBoxText::new` or
`ComboBoxText::new_with_entry`.

You can add items to a `ComboBoxText` with
`ComboBoxText::append_text`, `ComboBoxText::insert_text`
or `ComboBoxText::prepend_text` and remove options with
`ComboBoxText::remove`.

If the `ComboBoxText` contains an entry (via the “has-entry” property),
its contents can be retrieved using `ComboBoxText::get_active_text`.
The entry itself can be accessed by calling `gtk_bin_get_child` on the
combo box.

You should not call `ComboBoxExt::set_model` or attempt to pack more cells
into this combo box via its `CellLayout` interface.

# `ComboBoxText` as `Buildable`

The `ComboBoxText` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding items directly using the `<items>` element and specifying `<item>`
elements for each item. Each `<item>` element can specify the “id”
corresponding to the appended text and also supports the regular
translation attributes “translatable”, “context” and “comments”.

Here is a UI definition fragment specifying `ComboBoxText` items:

```plain
combobox
╰── box.linked
    ├── entry.combo
    ├── button.combo
    ╰── window.popup
```

`ComboBoxText` has a single CSS node with name combobox. It adds
the style class .combo to the main CSS nodes of its entry and button
children, and the .linked class to the node of its internal box.

<!-- struct Constraint -->
`Constraint` describes a constraint between an attribute on a widget
and another attribute on another widget, expressed as a linear equation
like:


```text
  target.attr1 = source.attr2 × multiplier + constant
```

Each `Constraint` is part of a system that will be solved by a
`ConstraintLayout` in order to allocate and position each child widget.

The source and target widgets, as well as their attributes, of a
`Constraint` instance are immutable after creation.

`ConstraintLayout` is a layout manager that uses relations between

and allocate widgets.

# How do constraints work

Constraints are objects defining the relationship between attributes
of a widget; you can read the description of the `Constraint`
class to have a more in depth definition.

By taking multiple constraints and applying them to the children of
a widget using `ConstraintLayout`, it's possible to describe complex
layout policies; each constraint applied to a child or to the parent
widgets contributes to the full description of the layout, in terms of
parameters for resolving the value of each attribute.

It is important to note that a layout is defined by the totality of
constraints; removing a child, or a constraint, from an existing layout
without changing the remaining constraints may result in an unstable
or unsolvable layout.

Constraints have an implicit "reading order"; you should start describing
each edge of each child, as well as their relationship with the parent
container, from the top left (or top right, in RTL languages), horizontally
first, and then vertically.

A constraint-based layout with too few constraints can become "unstable",
that is: have more than one solution. The behavior of an unstable layout
is undefined.

A constraint-based layout with conflicting constraints may be unsolvable,
and lead to an unstable layout. You can use the `Constraint:strength`
property of `Constraint` to "nudge" the layout towards a solution.

# `ConstraintLayout` as `Buildable`

`ConstraintLayout` implements the `Buildable` interface and has a
custom "constraints" element which allows describing constraints in a
`Builder` UI file.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying a constraint:


```text
  <object class="GtkConstraintLayout">
    <constraints>
      <constraint target="button" target-attribute="start"
                  relation="eq"
                  source="super" source-attribute="start"
                  constant="12"
                  strength="required" />
      <constraint target="button" target-attribute="width"
                  relation="ge"
                  constant="250"
                  strength="strong" />
    </constraints>
  </object>
```

The definition above will add two constraints to the `ConstraintLayout`:

 - a required constraint between the leading edge of "button" and
 the leading edge of the widget using the constraint layout, plus
 12 pixels
 - a strong, constant constraint making the width of "button" greater
 than, or equal to 250 pixels

The "target" and "target-attribute" attributes are required.

The "source" and "source-attribute" attributes of the "constraint"
element are optional; if they are not specified, the constraint is
assumed to be a constant.

The "relation" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
is assumed to be an equality.

The "strength" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
is assumed to be required.

The "source" and "target" attributes can be set to "super" to indicate
that the constraint target is the widget using the `ConstraintLayout`.

There can be "constant" and "multiplier" attributes.

Additionally, the "constraints" element can also contain a description
of the ``GtkConstraintGuides`` used by the layout:


```text
  <constraints>
    <guide min-width="100" max-width="500" name="hspace"/>
    <guide min-height="64" nat-height="128" name="vspace" strength="strong"/>
  </constraints>
```

The "guide" element has the following optional attributes:

 - "min-width", "nat-width", and "max-width", describe the minimum,
 natural, and maximum width of the guide, respectively
 - "min-height", "nat-height", and "max-height", describe the minimum,
 natural, and maximum height of the guide, respectively
 - "strength" describes the strength of the constraint on the natural
 size of the guide; if not specified, the constraint is assumed to
 have a medium strength
 - "name" describes a name for the guide, useful when debugging

# Using the Visual Format Language

Complex constraints can be described using a compact syntax called VFL,
or *Visual Format Language*.

The Visual Format Language describes all the constraints on a row or
column, typically starting from the leading edge towards the trailing
one. Each element of the layout is composed by "views", which identify
a `ConstraintTarget`.

For instance:


```text
  [button]-[textField]
```

Describes a constraint that binds the trailing edge of "button" to the
leading edge of "textField", leaving a default space between the two.

Using VFL is also possible to specify predicates that describe constraints
on attributes like width and height:


```text
  // Width must be greater than, or equal to 50
  [button(>=50)]

  // Width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
  [button1(==button2)]
```

The default orientation for a VFL description is horizontal, unless
otherwise specified:


```text
  // horizontal orientation, default attribute: width
  H:[button(>=150)]

  // vertical orientation, default attribute: height
  V:[button1(==button2)]
```

It's also possible to specify multiple predicates, as well as their
strength:


```text
  // minimum width of button must be 150
  // natural width of button can be 250
  [button(>=150@required, ==250@medium)]
```

Finally, it's also possible to use simple arithmetic operators:


```text
  // width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
  // divided by 2 plus 12
  [button1(button2 / 2 + 12)]
```

# Implements

[`LayoutManagerExt`](trait.LayoutManagerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn new -->
Creates a new `ConstraintLayout` layout manager.

# Returns

the newly created `ConstraintLayout`
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn add_constraint -->
Adds a `Constraint` to the layout manager.

The `Constraint:source` and `Constraint:target`
properties of `constraint` can be:

 - set to `None` to indicate that the constraint refers to the
 widget using `self`
 - set to the `Widget` using `self`
 - set to a child of the `Widget` using `self`
 - set to a guide that is part of `self`

The `self` acquires the ownership of `constraint` after calling
this function.
## `constraint`
a `Constraint`
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn add_constraints_from_description -->
Creates a list of constraints they formal description using a compact
description syntax called VFL, or "Visual Format Language".

This function is a convenience wrapper around
`ConstraintLayout::add_constraints_from_descriptionv`, using
variadic arguments to populate the view/target map.
## `lines`

 defining a set of constraints
## `n_lines`
the number of lines
## `hspacing`
default horizontal spacing value, or -1 for the fallback value

## `error`
return location for a `glib::Error`
## `first_view`
the name of a view in the VFL description, followed by the
 `ConstraintTarget` to which it maps

# Returns

the list of
 ``GtkConstraints`` that were added to the layout
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn add_constraints_from_descriptionv -->
Creates a list of constraints from a formal description using a compact
description syntax called VFL, or "Visual Format Language".

The Visual Format Language is based on Apple's AutoLayout [VFL](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage.html).

The `views` dictionary is used to match ``GtkConstraintTargets`` to the symbolic
view name inside the VFL.

The VFL grammar is:


```plain
       <visualFormatString> = (<orientation>)?
                              (<superview><connection>)?
                              <view>(<connection><view>)*
                              (<connection><superview>)?
              <orientation> = 'H' | 'V'
                <superview> = '|'
               <connection> = '' | '-' <predicateList> '-' | '-'
            <predicateList> = <simplePredicate> | <predicateListWithParens>
          <simplePredicate> = <metricName> | <positiveNumber>
  <predicateListWithParens> = '(' <predicate> (',' <predicate>)* ')'
                <predicate> = (<relation>)? <objectOfPredicate> (<operatorList>)? ('@' <priority>)?
                 <relation> = '==' | '<=' | '>='
        <objectOfPredicate> = <constant> | <viewName> | ('.' <attributeName>)?
                 <priority> = <positiveNumber> | 'required' | 'strong' | 'medium' | 'weak'
                 <constant> = <number>
             <operatorList> = (<multiplyOperator>)? (<addOperator>)?
         <multiplyOperator> = [ '*' | '/' ] <positiveNumber>
              <addOperator> = [ '+' | '-' ] <positiveNumber>
                 <viewName> = [A-Za-z_]([A-Za-z0-9_]*) // A C identifier
               <metricName> = [A-Za-z_]([A-Za-z0-9_]*) // A C identifier
            <attributeName> = 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' | 'width' | 'height' |
                              'start' | 'end' | 'centerX' | 'centerY' | 'baseline'
           <positiveNumber> // A positive real number parseable by g_ascii_strtod()
                   <number> // A real number parseable by g_ascii_strtod()
```

**Note**: The VFL grammar used by GTK is slightly different than the one
defined by Apple, as it can use symbolic values for the constraint's
strength instead of numeric values; additionally, GTK allows adding
simple arithmetic operations inside predicates.

Examples of VFL descriptions are:


```plain
  // Default spacing
  [button]-[textField]

  // Width constraint
  [button(>=50)]

  // Connection to super view
  |-50-[purpleBox]-50-|

  // Vertical layout
  V:[topField]-10-[bottomField]

  // Flush views
  [maroonView][blueView]

  // Priority
  [button(100@strong)]

  // Equal widths
  [button1(==button2)]

  // Multiple predicates
  [flexibleButton(>=70,<=100)]

  // A complete line of layout
  |-[find]-[findNext]-[findField(>=20)]-|

  // Operators
  [button1(button2 / 3 + 50)]

  // Named attributes
  [button1(==button2.height)]
```
## `lines`
an array of Visual Format Language lines
 defining a set of constraints
## `n_lines`
the number of lines
## `hspacing`
default horizontal spacing value, or -1 for the fallback value
## `vspacing`
default vertical spacing value, or -1 for the fallback value
## `views`
a dictionary of [ name, target ]
 pairs; the `name` keys map to the view names in the VFL lines, while
 the `target` values map to children of the widget using a `ConstraintLayout`, or guides

# Returns

the list of
 ``GtkConstraints`` that were added to the layout
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn add_guide -->
Adds a guide to `self`. A guide can be used as
the source or target of constraints, like a widget,
but it is not visible.

The `self` acquires the ownership of `guide` after calling
this function.
## `guide`

<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn observe_constraints -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the constraints that are
part of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping
to track constraints and emit signals on the returned listmodel.
It may slow down operations a lot.

Applications should try hard to avoid calling this function
because of the slowdowns.

# Returns

a
 `gio::ListModel` tracking `self`'s constraints
<!-- impl ConstraintLayout::fn observe_guides -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the guides that are
part of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping
to track guides and emit signals on the returned listmodel.
It may slow down operations a lot.

<!-- enum CssParserError::variant Name -->
The given name has not been defined
<!-- enum CssParserError::variant UnknownValue -->
The given value is not
 correct

Warnings that can occur while parsing CSS.

Unlike ``GtkCssParserErrors``, warnings do not cause the parser to
skip any input, but they indicate issues that should be fixed.
<!-- enum CssParserWarning::variant Deprecated -->
The given construct is
 deprecated and will be removed in a future version
<!-- enum CssParserWarning::variant Syntax -->
A syntax construct was used
 that should be avoided
<!-- enum CssParserWarning::variant Unimplemented -->

<!-- struct CssProvider -->
`CssProvider` is an object implementing the `StyleProvider` interface.
It is able to parse [CSS-like][css-overview] input in order to style widgets.

An application can make GTK parse a specific CSS style sheet by calling
`CssProvider::load_from_file` or `CssProvider::load_from_resource`
and adding the provider with `StyleContextExt::add_provider` or
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

In addition, certain files will be read when GTK is initialized. First, the
file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` is loaded if it exists. Then, GTK
loads the first existing file among
`XDG_DATA_HOME/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`,
`$HOME/.themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`,
`$XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css` and
`DATADIR/share/themes/THEME/gtk-VERSION/gtk-VARIANT.css`,
where `THEME` is the name of the current theme (see the `Settings:gtk-theme-name`
setting), VARIANT is the variant to load (see the
`Settings:gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` setting), `DATADIR`
is the prefix configured when GTK was compiled (unless overridden by the
`GTK_DATA_PREFIX` environment variable), and `VERSION` is the GTK version number.
If no file is found for the current version, GTK tries older versions all the
way back to 4.0.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`StyleProviderExt`](trait.StyleProviderExt.html)
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn new -->
Returns a newly created `CssProvider`.

# Returns

A new `CssProvider`
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn load_from_data -->
Loads `data` into `self`, and by doing so clears any previously loaded
information.
## `data`
CSS data loaded in memory
## `length`
the length of `data` in bytes, or -1 for NUL terminated strings. If
 `length` is not -1, the code will assume it is not NUL terminated and will
 potentially do a copy.
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn load_from_file -->
Loads the data contained in `file` into `self`, making it
clear any previously loaded information.
## `file`
`gio::File` pointing to a file to load
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn load_from_path -->
Loads the data contained in `path` into `self`, making it clear
any previously loaded information.
## `path`
the path of a filename to load, in the GLib filename encoding
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn load_from_resource -->
Loads the data contained in the resource at `resource_path` into
the `CssProvider`, clearing any previously loaded information.

To track errors while loading CSS, connect to the
`CssProvider::parsing-error` signal.
## `resource_path`
a `gio::Resource` resource path
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn load_named -->
Loads a theme from the usual theme paths. The actual process of
finding the theme might change between releases, but it is
guaranteed that this function uses the same mechanism to load the
theme that GTK uses for loading its own theme.
## `name`
A theme name
## `variant`
variant to load, for example, "dark", or
 `None` for the default
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn to_string -->
Converts the `self` into a string representation in CSS
format.

Using `CssProvider::load_from_data` with the return value
from this function on a new provider created with
`CssProvider::new` will basically create a duplicate of
this `self`.

# Returns

a new string representing the `self`.
<!-- impl CssProvider::fn connect_parsing_error -->
Signals that a parsing error occurred. the `path`, `line` and `position`
describe the actual location of the error as accurately as possible.

Parsing errors are never fatal, so the parsing will resume after
the error. Errors may however cause parts of the given
data or even all of it to not be parsed at all. So it is a useful idea
to check that the parsing succeeds by connecting to this signal.

Note that this signal may be emitted at any time as the css provider
may opt to defer parsing parts or all of the input to a later time
than when a loading function was called.
## `section`
section the error happened in
## `error`
The parsing error
<!-- struct CssSection -->
Defines a part of a CSS document. Because sections are nested into
one another, you can use `CssSection::get_parent` to get the
containing region.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn new -->
Creates a new `CssSection` referring to the section
in the given `file` from the `start` location to the
`end` location.
## `file`
The file this section refers to
## `start`
The start location
## `end`
The end location

# Returns

a new `CssSection`
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_end_location -->
Returns the location in the CSS document where this section ends.

# Returns

The end location of
 this section
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_file -->
Gets the file that `self` was parsed from. If no such file exists,
for example because the CSS was loaded via
`CssProvider::load_from_data`(), then `None` is returned.

# Returns

the `gio::File` that `self` was parsed from
 or `None` if `self` was parsed from other data
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_parent -->
Gets the parent section for the given `self`. The parent section is
the section that contains this `self`. A special case are sections of
type `GTK_CSS_SECTION_DOCUMENT`. Their parent will either be `None`
if they are the original CSS document that was loaded by
`CssProvider::load_from_file` or a section of type
`GTK_CSS_SECTION_IMPORT` if it was loaded with an import rule from
a different file.

# Returns

the parent section or `None` if none
<!-- impl CssSection::fn get_start_location -->
Returns the location in the CSS document where this section starts.

# Returns

The start location of
 this section
<!-- impl CssSection::fn print -->
Prints the `self` into `string` in a human-readable form. This
is a form like `gtk.css:32:1-23` to denote line 32, characters
1 to 23 in the file gtk.css.
## `string`
a `glib::String` to print to
<!-- impl CssSection::fn ref -->
Increments the reference count on `self`.

# Returns

`self` itself.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn to_string -->
Prints the section into a human-readable text form using
`CssSection::print`.

# Returns

A new string.
<!-- impl CssSection::fn unref -->
Decrements the reference count on `self`, freeing the
structure if the reference count reaches 0.
<!-- struct CustomFilter -->
`CustomFilter` is a `Filter` that uses a callback to determine
whether to include an item or not.

# Implements

[`FilterExt`](trait.FilterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CustomFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new filter using the given `match_func` to filter
items.

If `match_func` is `None`, the filter matches all items.

If the filter func changes its filtering behavior,
`FilterExt::changed` needs to be called.
## `match_func`
function to filter items
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `match_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notify for `user_data`

# Returns

a new `CustomFilter`
<!-- impl CustomFilter::fn set_filter_func -->
Sets (or unsets) the function used for filtering items.

If `match_func` is `None`, the filter matches all items.

If the filter func changes its filtering behavior,
`FilterExt::changed` needs to be called.

If a previous function was set, its `user_destroy` will be
called now.
## `match_func`
function to filter items
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `match_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notify for `user_data`
<!-- struct CustomSorter -->
`CustomSorter` is a `Sorter` implementation that sorts
via a traditional `GCompareDataFunc` callback.

# Implements

[`SorterExt`](trait.SorterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl CustomSorter::fn new -->
Creates a new `Sorter` that works by calling
`sort_func` to compare items.

If `sort_func` is `None`, all items are considered equal.
## `sort_func`
the `GCompareDataFunc` to use for sorting
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `sort_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notify for `user_data`

# Returns

a new `CustomSorter`
<!-- impl CustomSorter::fn set_sort_func -->
Sets (or unsets) the function used for sorting items.

If `sort_func` is `None`, all items are considered equal.

If the sort func changes its sorting behavior,
`SorterExt::changed` needs to be called.

If a previous function was set, its `user_destroy` will be
called now.
## `sort_func`
function to sort items
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `match_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notify for `user_data`

<!-- enum DeleteType::variant DisplayLineEnds -->
Delete only the portion of the
 display-line to the left/right of cursor.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant ParagraphEnds -->
Delete to the end of the
 paragraph. Like C-k in Emacs (or its reverse).
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Paragraphs -->
Delete entire line. Like C-k in pico.
<!-- enum DeleteType::variant Whitespace -->
Delete only whitespace. Like M-\ in Emacs.
<!-- struct Dialog -->
Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
of input, e.g. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.

GTK treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a
`Box`, and is where widgets such as a `Label` or a `Entry` should
be packed. The bottom area is known as the
“action area”. This is generally used for
packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as
cancel, ok, or apply.

`Dialog` boxes are created with a call to `Dialog::new` or
`Dialog::new_with_buttons`. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` is
recommended; it allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient
flags, and add simple buttons.

A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
from user input), can be created by calling `GtkWindowExt::set_modal` on the
dialog. Use the GTK_WINDOW() macro to cast the widget returned from
`Dialog::new` into a `Window`. When using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`
you can also pass the `DialogFlags::Modal` flag to make a dialog modal.

If you add buttons to `Dialog` using `Dialog::new_with_buttons`,
`DialogExt::add_button`, `Dialog::add_buttons`, or
`DialogExt::add_action_widget`, clicking the button will emit a signal
called `Dialog::response` with a response ID that you specified. GTK
will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely
user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the
`ResponseType` enumeration (these all have values less than zero). If
a dialog receives a delete event, the `Dialog::response` signal will
be emitted with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.

For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you’d probably
use `MessageDialog` to save yourself some effort. But you’d need to
create the dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message
in the dialog.

An example for simple `Dialog` usage:

```C
// Function to open a dialog box with a message
void
quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, char *message)
{
 GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
 GtkDialogFlags flags;

 // Create the widgets
 flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
                                       parent,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
                                       NULL);
 content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 label = gtk_label_new (message);

 // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds

 g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
                           "response",
                           G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                           dialog);

 // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added

 gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (content_area), label);
 gtk_widget_show (dialog);
}
```

# `Dialog` as `Buildable`

The `Dialog` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes the
`content_area` and `action_area` as internal children with the names
“content_area” and “action_area”.

`Dialog` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`). To mark a response
as default, set the “default“ attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
to true.

`Dialog` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action“ as
the “type“ attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
on the “use-header-bar“ property. The response id has to be associated
with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.

An example of a `Dialog` UI definition fragment:

```text
<object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>
  </child>
  <child type="action">
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok">
    </object>
  </child>
  <action-widgets>
    <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>
    <action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget>
  </action-widgets>
</object>
```

<!-- impl Dialog::fn new -->
Creates a new dialog box.

Widgets should not be packed into this `Window`
directly, but into the `content_area` and `action_area`, as described above.

# Returns

the new dialog as a `Widget`
<!-- impl Dialog::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `Dialog` with title `title` (or `None` for the default
title; see `GtkWindowExt::set_title`) and transient parent `parent` (or
`None` for none; see `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`). The `flags`
argument can be used to make the dialog modal (`DialogFlags::Modal`)
and/or to have it destroyed along with its transient parent
(`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent`). After `flags`, button
text/response ID pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending
the list. Button text can be arbitrary text. A response ID can be
any positive number, or one of the values in the `ResponseType`
enumeration. If the user clicks one of these dialog buttons,
`Dialog` will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with the corresponding
response ID. If a `Dialog` receives a delete event,
it will emit ::response with a response ID of `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.
However, destroying a dialog does not emit the ::response signal;
so be careful relying on ::response when using the
`DialogFlags::DestroyWithParent` flag. Buttons are from left to right,
so the first button in the list will be the leftmost button in the dialog.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 GtkWindow *main_app_window; // Window the dialog should show up on
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("My dialog",
                                       main_app_window,
                                       flags,
                                       _("_OK"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                       _("_Cancel"),
                                       GTK_RESPONSE_REJECT,
                                       NULL);
```

Title of the dialog, or `None`
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog, or `None`
## `flags`
from `DialogFlags`
## `first_button_text`
text to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Dialog`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_action_widget -->
Adds an activatable widget to the action area of a `Dialog`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `Dialog::response`
signal on the dialog when the widget is activated. The widget is
appended to the end of the dialog’s action area. If you want to add a
non-activatable widget, simply pack it into the `action_area` field
of the `Dialog` struct.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the `Dialog::response` signal with
the given `response_id`. The button is appended to the end of the
dialog’s action area. The button widget is returned, but usually
you don’t need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget that was added
<!-- trait DialogExtManual::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `DialogExt::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `Dialog::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_content_area -->
Returns the content area of `self`.

# Returns

the content area `Box`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_header_bar -->
Returns the header bar of `self`. Note that the
headerbar is only used by the dialog if the
`Dialog:use-header-bar` property is `true`.

# Returns

the header bar
<!-- trait DialogExtManual::fn get_response_for_widget -->
Gets the response id of a widget in the action area
of a dialog.
## `widget`
a widget in the action area of `self`

# Returns

the response id of `widget`, or `ResponseType::None`
 if `widget` doesn’t have a response id set.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_widget_for_response -->
Gets the widget button that uses the given response ID in the action area
of a dialog.
## `response_id`
the response ID used by the `self` widget

# Returns

the `widget` button that uses the given
 `response_id`, or `None`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn response -->
Emits the `Dialog::response` signal with the given response ID.

Used to indicate that the user has responded to the dialog in some way.
## `response_id`
response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_default_response -->
Sets the last widget in the dialog’s action area with the given `response_id`
as the default widget for the dialog. Pressing “Enter” normally activates
the default widget.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_response_sensitive -->
Calls `gtk_widget_set_sensitive (widget, @setting)`
for each widget in the dialog’s action area with the given `response_id`.
A convenient way to sensitize/desensitize dialog buttons.
## `response_id`
a response ID
## `setting`
`true` for sensitive
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user uses a keybinding to close
the dialog.

The default binding for this signal is the Escape key.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when an action widget is clicked, the dialog receives a
delete event, or the application programmer calls `DialogExt::response`.
On a delete event, the response ID is `ResponseType::DeleteEvent`.
Otherwise, it depends on which action widget was clicked.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn get_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the dialog uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- trait DialogExt::fn set_property_use_header_bar -->
`true` if the dialog uses a `HeaderBar` for action buttons
instead of the action-area.

For technical reasons, this property is declared as an integer
property, but you should only set it to `true` or `false`.
<!-- struct DialogFlags -->
Flags used to influence dialog construction.
<!-- struct DialogFlags::const MODAL -->

Move up.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Down -->
Move down.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Left -->
Move left.
<!-- enum DirectionType::variant Right -->
Move right.
<!-- struct DirectoryList -->
`DirectoryList` is a list model that wraps `gio::File::enumerate_children_async`.
It presents a `gio::ListModel` and fills it asynchronously with the `GFileInfos`
returned from that function.

Enumeration will start automatically when a the `DirectoryList:file` property
is set.

While the `DirectoryList` is being filled, the `DirectoryList:loading`
property will be set to `true`. You can listen to that property if you want
to show information like a `Spinner` or a "Loading..." text.

If loading fails at any point, the `DirectoryList:error` property will be
set to give more indication about the failure.

The `GFileInfos` returned from a `DirectoryList` have the "standard::file"
attribute set to the `gio::File` they refer to. This way you can get at the file
that is referred to in the same way you would via `gio::FileEnumerator::get_child`.
This means you do not need access to the `DirectoryList` but can access
the `gio::File` directly from the `gio::FileInfo` when operating with a `ListView`
or similar.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn new -->
Creates a new `DirectoryList` querying the given `file` with the given
`attributes`.
## `attributes`
The attributes to query with
## `file`
The file to query

# Returns

a new `DirectoryList`
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_attributes -->
Gets the attributes queried on the children.

# Returns

The queried attributes
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_error -->
Gets the loading error, if any.

If an error occurs during the loading process, the loading process
will finish and this property allows querying the error that happened.
This error will persist until a file is loaded again.

An error being set does not mean that no files were loaded, and all
successfully queried files will remain in the list.

# Returns

The loading error or `None` if
 loading finished successfully.
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_file -->
Gets the file whose children are currently enumerated.

# Returns

The file whose children are enumerated
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_io_priority -->
Gets the IO priority set via `DirectoryList::set_io_priority`.

# Returns

The IO priority.
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_monitored -->
Returns whether the directory list is monitoring
the directory for changes.

# Returns

`true` if the directory is monitored
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn is_loading -->
Returns `true` if the children enumeration is currently in
progress.

Files will be added to `self` from time to time while loading is
going on. The order in which are added is undefined and may change
in between runs.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is loading
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_attributes -->
Sets the `attributes` to be enumerated and starts the enumeration.

If `attributes` is `None`, no attributes will be queried, but a list
of `GFileInfos` will still be created.
## `attributes`
the attributes to enumerate
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_file -->
Sets the `file` to be enumerated and starts the enumeration.

If `file` is `None`, the result will be an empty list.
## `file`
the `gio::File` to be enumerated
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_io_priority -->
Sets the IO priority to use while loading directories.

Setting the priority while `self` is loading will reprioritize the
ongoing load as soon as possible.

The default IO priority is `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`, which is higher than
the GTK redraw priority. If you are loading a lot of directories in
parallel, lowering it to something like `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE`
may increase responsiveness.
## `io_priority`
IO priority to use
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_monitored -->
Sets whether the directory list will monitor the directory
for changes. If monitoring is enabled, the
`gio::ListModel::items-changed` signal will be emitted when the
directory contents change.

When monitoring is turned on after the initial creation
of the directory list, the directory is reloaded to avoid
missing files that appeared between the initial loading
and when monitoring was turned on.
## `monitored`
`true` to monitor the directory for changes
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_attributes -->
The attributes to query
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_property_attributes -->
The attributes to query
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_error -->
Error encountered while loading files
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_file -->
File to query
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_property_file -->
File to query
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_io_priority -->
Priority used when loading
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_property_io_priority -->
Priority used when loading
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_loading -->
`true` if files are being loaded
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn get_property_monitored -->
`true` if the directory is monitored for changed
<!-- impl DirectoryList::fn set_property_monitored -->
`true` if the directory is monitored for changed
<!-- struct DragIcon -->
`DragIcon` is a `Root` implementation with the sole purpose
to serve as a drag icon during DND operations. A drag icon moves
with the pointer during a drag operation and is destroyed when
the drag ends.

To set up a drag icon and associate it with an ongoing drag operation,
use `DragIcon::get_for_drag` to get the icon for a drag. You can
then use it like any other widget and use `DragIcon::set_child` to
set whatever widget should be used for the drag icon.

Keep in mind that drag icons do not allow user input.

<!-- impl DragIcon::fn create_widget_for_value -->
Creates a widget that can be used as a drag icon for the given
`value`.

Supported types include strings, `gdk::RGBA` and `TextBuffer`.
If GTK does not know how to create a widget for a given value,
it will return `None`.

This method is used to set the default drag icon on drag'n'drop
operations started by `DragSource`, so you don't need to set
a drag icon using this function there.
## `value`
a `gobject::Value`

# Returns

A new `Widget`
 for displaying `value` as a drag icon.
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn get_for_drag -->
Gets the `DragIcon` in use with `drag`.

If no drag icon exists yet, a new one will be created
and shown.
## `drag`
a `gdk::Drag`

# Returns

the `DragIcon`
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn set_from_paintable -->
Creates a `DragIcon` that shows `paintable`, and associates
it with the drag operation. The hotspot position on the paintable
is aligned with the hotspot of the cursor.
## `drag`
a `gdk::Drag`
## `paintable`
a `gdk::Paintable` to display
## `hot_x`
X coordinate of the hotspot
## `hot_y`
Y coordinate of the hotspot
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn get_child -->
Gets the widget currently used as drag icon.

# Returns

The drag icon or `None` if none.
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn set_child -->
Sets the widget to display as the drag icon.
## `child`
a `Widget` or `None`
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn get_property_child -->
The widget to display as drag icon.
<!-- impl DragIcon::fn set_property_child -->
The widget to display as drag icon.
<!-- struct DragSource -->
`DragSource` is an auxiliary object that is used to initiate
Drag-And-Drop operations. It can be set up with the necessary
ingredients for a DND operation ahead of time. This includes
the source for the data that is being transferred, in the form
of a `gdk::ContentProvider`, the desired action, and the icon to
use during the drag operation. After setting it up, the drag
source must be added to a widget as an event controller, using
`WidgetExt::add_controller`.


```C
static void
my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
{
  GtkDragSource *drag_source = gtk_drag_source_new ();

  g_signal_connect (drag_source, "prepare", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_prepare), self);
  g_signal_connect (drag_source, "drag-begin", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_begin), self);

  gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (drag_source));
}
```

Setting up the content provider and icon ahead of time only
makes sense when the data does not change. More commonly, you
will want to set them up just in time. To do so, `DragSource`
has `DragSource::prepare` and `DragSource::drag-begin` signals.

The ::prepare signal is emitted before a drag is started, and
can be used to set the content provider and actions that the
drag should be started with.


```C
static GdkContentProvider *
on_drag_prepare (GtkDragSource *source,
                 double         x,
                 double         y,
                 MyWidget      *self)
{
  // This widget supports two types of content: GFile objects
  // and GdkPixbuf objects; GTK will handle the serialization
  // of these types automatically
  GFile *file = my_widget_get_file (self);
  GdkPixbuf *pixbuf = my_widget_get_pixbuf (self);

  return gdk_content_provider_new_union ((GdkContentProvider *[2]) {
      gdk_content_provider_new_typed (G_TYPE_FILE, file),
      gdk_content_provider_new_typed (GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF, pixbuf),
    }, 2);
}
```

The ::drag-begin signal is emitted after the `gdk::Drag` object has
been created, and can be used to set up the drag icon.


```C
static void
on_drag_begin (GtkDragSource *source,
               GtkDrag       *drag,
               MyWidget      *self)
{
  // Set the widget as the drag icon
  GdkPaintable *paintable = gtk_widget_paintable_new (GTK_WIDGET (self));
  gtk_drag_source_set_icon (source, paintable, 0, 0);
  g_object_unref (paintable);
}
```

During the DND operation, `DragSource` emits signals that
can be used to obtain updates about the status of the operation,
but it is not normally necessary to connect to any signals,
except for one case: when the supported actions include
`gdk::DragAction::Move`, you need to listen for the
`DragSource::drag-end` signal and delete the
data after it has been transferred.

<!-- impl DragSource::fn new -->
Creates a new `DragSource` object.

# Returns

the new `DragSource`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn drag_cancel -->
Cancels a currently ongoing drag operation.
<!-- impl DragSource::fn get_actions -->
Gets the actions that are currently set on the `DragSource`.

# Returns

the actions set on `self`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn get_content -->
Gets the current content provider of a `DragSource`.

# Returns

the `gdk::ContentProvider` of `self`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn get_drag -->
Returns the underlying `gdk::Drag` object for an ongoing drag.

# Returns

the `gdk::Drag` of the current drag operation, or `None`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn set_actions -->
Sets the actions on the `DragSource`.

During a DND operation, the actions are offered
to potential drop targets. If `actions` include
`gdk::DragAction::Move`, you need to listen to the
`DragSource::drag-end` signal and handle
`delete_data` being `true`.

This function can be called before a drag is started,
or in a handler for the `DragSource::prepare` signal.
## `actions`
the actions to offer
<!-- impl DragSource::fn set_content -->
Sets a content provider on a `DragSource`.

When the data is requested in the cause of a
DND operation, it will be obtained from the
content provider.

This function can be called before a drag is started,
or in a handler for the `DragSource::prepare` signal.

You may consider setting the content provider back to
`None` in a `DragSource::drag-end` signal handler.
## `content`
a `gdk::ContentProvider`, or `None`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn set_icon -->
Sets a paintable to use as icon during DND operations.

The hotspot coordinates determine the point on the icon
that gets aligned with the hotspot of the cursor.

If `paintable` is `None`, a default icon is used.

This function can be called before a drag is started, or in
a `DragSource::prepare` or `DragSource::drag-begin` signal handler.
## `paintable`
the `gdk::Paintable` to use as icon, or `None`
## `hot_x`
the hotspot X coordinate on the icon
## `hot_y`
the hotspot Y coordinate on the icon
<!-- impl DragSource::fn connect_drag_begin -->
The ::drag-begin signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag
is started. It can be used to e.g. set a custom drag icon with
`DragSource::set_icon`.
## `drag`
the `gdk::Drag` object
<!-- impl DragSource::fn connect_drag_cancel -->
The ::drag-cancel signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag has
failed. The signal handler may handle a failed drag operation based on
the type of error. It should return `true` if the failure has been handled
and the default "drag operation failed" animation should not be shown.
## `drag`
the `gdk::Drag` object
## `reason`
information on why the drag failed

# Returns

`true` if the failed drag operation has been already handled
<!-- impl DragSource::fn connect_drag_end -->
The ::drag-end signal is emitted on the drag source when a drag is
finished. A typical reason to connect to this signal is to undo
things done in `DragSource::prepare` or `DragSource::drag-begin`.
## `drag`
the `gdk::Drag` object
## `delete_data`
`true` if the drag was performing `gdk::DragAction::Move`,
 and the data should be deleted
<!-- impl DragSource::fn connect_prepare -->
The ::prepare signal is emitted when a drag is about to be initiated.
It returns the * `gdk::ContentProvider` to use for the drag that is about
to start. The default handler for this signal returns the value of
the `DragSource:content` property, so if you set up that property
ahead of time, you don't need to connect to this signal.
## `x`
the X coordinate of the drag starting point
## `y`
the Y coordinate fo the drag starting point

# Returns

a `gdk::ContentProvider`, or `None`
<!-- impl DragSource::fn get_property_actions -->
The actions that are supported by drag operations from the source.

Note that you must handle the `DragSource::drag-end` signal
if the actions include `gdk::DragAction::Move`.
<!-- impl DragSource::fn set_property_actions -->
The actions that are supported by drag operations from the source.

Note that you must handle the `DragSource::drag-end` signal
if the actions include `gdk::DragAction::Move`.
<!-- impl DragSource::fn get_property_content -->
The data that is offered by drag operations from this source,
in the form of a `gdk::ContentProvider`.
<!-- impl DragSource::fn set_property_content -->
The data that is offered by drag operations from this source,
in the form of a `gdk::ContentProvider`.
<!-- struct DrawingArea -->
The `DrawingArea` widget is used for creating custom user interface
elements. It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:

- The `Widget::realize` signal to take any necessary actions
 when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
 (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)

- The `DrawingArea::resize` signal to take any necessary
 actions when the widget changes size.

- Call `DrawingAreaExt::set_draw_func` to handle redrawing the
 contents of the widget.

The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
color.

## Simple `DrawingArea` usage


```C
static void
draw_function (GtkDrawingArea *area,
               cairo_t        *cr,
               int             width,
               int             height,
               gpointer        data)
{
  GdkRGBA color;
  GtkStyleContext *context;

  context = gtk_widget_get_style_context (GTK_WIDGET (area));

  cairo_arc (cr,
             width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
             MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
             0, 2 * G_PI);

  gtk_style_context_get_color (context,
                               &color);
  gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);

  cairo_fill (cr);
}

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  gtk_init ();

  GtkWidget *area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
  gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
  gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
  gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area),
                                  draw_function,
                                  NULL, NULL);
  return 0;
}
```

The draw function is normally called when a drawing area first comes
onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
You can also force a redraw by adding to the “damage region” of the
drawing area’s window using `WidgetExt::queue_draw`.
This will cause the drawing area to call the draw function again.

The available routines for drawing are documented on the
[GDK Drawing Primitives][gdk4-Cairo-Interaction] page
and the cairo documentation.

To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to use
event controllers. To receive keyboard events, you will need to set
the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you should probably
draw some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused.

If you need more complex control over your widget, you should consider
creating your own `Widget` subclass.

<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt -->
Trait containing all `DrawingArea` methods.

# Implementors

[`DrawingArea`](struct.DrawingArea.html)
<!-- impl DrawingArea::fn new -->
Creates a new drawing area.

# Returns

a new `DrawingArea`
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_content_height -->
Retrieves the value previously set via `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_height`.

# Returns

The height requested for content of the drawing area
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_content_width -->
Retrieves the value previously set via `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_width`.

# Returns

The width requested for content of the drawing area
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_content_height -->
Sets the desired height of the contents of the drawing area. Note that
because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested, it is
possible that the actual height passed to your draw function is larger
than the height set here. You can use `WidgetExt::set_valign` to avoid
that.

If the height is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear.
## `height`
the height of contents
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_content_width -->
Sets the desired width of the contents of the drawing area. Note that
because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested, it is
possible that the actual width passed to your draw function is larger
than the width set here. You can use `WidgetExt::set_halign` to avoid
that.

If the width is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear.
## `width`
the width of contents
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_draw_func -->
Setting a draw function is the main thing you want to do when using a drawing
area. It is called whenever GTK needs to draw the contents of the drawing area
to the screen.

The draw function will be called during the drawing stage of GTK. In the
drawing stage it is not allowed to change properties of any GTK widgets or call
any functions that would cause any properties to be changed.
You should restrict yourself exclusively to drawing your contents in the draw
function.

If what you are drawing does change, call `WidgetExt::queue_draw` on the
drawing area. This will cause a redraw and will call `draw_func` again.
## `draw_func`
callback that lets you draw
 the drawing area's contents
## `user_data`
user data passed to `draw_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn connect_resize -->
The ::resize signal is emitted once when the widget is realized, and
then each time the widget is changed while realized. This is useful
in order to keep state up to date with the widget size, like for
instance a backing surface.
## `width`
the width of the viewport
## `height`
the height of the viewport
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_property_content_height -->

<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_property_content_height -->
The content height. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_height` for details.
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn get_property_content_width -->
The content width. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_width` for details.
<!-- trait DrawingAreaExt::fn set_property_content_width -->
The content width. See `DrawingAreaExt::set_content_width` for details.
<!-- struct DropControllerMotion -->
`DropControllerMotion` is an event controller meant for tracking
the pointer hovering over a widget during a drag and drop operation.

It is modeled after `EventControllerMotion` so if you have used
that, this should feel really familiar.

The drop controller is not able to accept drops, use `DropTarget`
for that purpose.

## `x`
coordinates of pointer location
## `y`
coordinates of pointer location
<!-- impl DropControllerMotion::fn connect_leave -->
Signals that the pointer has left the widget.
<!-- impl DropControllerMotion::fn connect_motion -->
Emitted when the pointer moves inside the widget.
## `x`
the x coordinate
## `y`
the y coordinate
<!-- impl DropControllerMotion::fn get_property_contains_pointer -->
Whether the pointer of a drag and drop operation is in the controller's
widget or a descendant.
See also `DropControllerMotion:is-pointer`.

When handling crossing events, this property is updated
before `DropControllerMotion::enter` but after
`DropControllerMotion::leave` is emitted.
<!-- impl DropControllerMotion::fn get_property_drop -->
The ongoing drop operation over the controller's widget or its descendant.
If no drop operation is going on, this property returns `None`.

The event controller should not modify the `drop`, but it might want to query
its properties.

When handling crossing events, this property is updated
before `DropControllerMotion::enter` but after
`DropControllerMotion::leave` is emitted.
<!-- impl DropControllerMotion::fn get_property_is_pointer -->
Whether the pointer is in the controllers widget itself,
as opposed to in a descendent widget. See also
`DropControllerMotion:contains-pointer`.

When handling crossing events, this property is updated
before `DropControllerMotion::enter` but after
`DropControllerMotion::leave` is emitted.
<!-- struct DropDown -->
`DropDown` is a widget that allows the user to choose an item
from a list of options. The `DropDown` displays the selected
choice.

The options are given to `DropDown` in the form of `gio::ListModel`,
and how the individual options are represented is determined by
a `ListItemFactory`. The default factory displays simple strings.

`DropDown` knows how to obtain strings from the items in a
`StringList`; for other models, you have to provide an expression
to find the strings via `DropDown::set_expression`.

`DropDown` can optionally allow search in the popup, which is
useful if the list of options is long. To enable the search entry,
use `DropDown::set_enable_search`.

# CSS nodes

`DropDown` has a single CSS node with name dropdown,
with the button and popover nodes as children.

# Accessibility

`DropDown` uses the `AccessibleRole::ComboBox` role.

<!-- struct DropTarget -->
`DropTarget` is an event controller implementing a simple way to
receive Drag-and-Drop operations.

The most basic way to use a `DropTarget` to receive drops on a
widget is to create it via `DropTarget::new` passing in the
`glib::Type` of the data you want to receive and connect to the
`DropTarget`::drop signal to receive the data:


```C
static gboolean
on_drop (GtkDropTarget *target,
         const GValue  *value,
         double         x,
         double         y,
         gpointer       data)
{
  MyWidget *self = data;

  // Call the appropriate setter depending on the type of data
  // that we received
  if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, G_TYPE_FILE))
    my_widget_set_file (self, g_value_get_object (value));
  else if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF))
    my_widget_set_pixbuf (self, g_value_get_object (value));
  else
    return FALSE;

  return TRUE;
}

static void
my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
{
  GtkDropTarget *target =
    gtk_drop_target_new (G_TYPE_INVALID, GDK_ACTION_COPY);

  // This widget accepts two types of drop types: GFile objects
  // and GdkPixbuf objects
  gtk_drop_target_set_gtypes (target, (GTypes [2]) {
    G_TYPE_FILE,
    GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF,
  }, 2);

  gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (target));
}
```

`DropTarget` supports more options, such as:

 * rejecting potential drops via the `DropTarget::accept` signal
 and the `DropTarget::reject` function to let other drop
 targets handle the drop
 * tracking an ongoing drag operation before the drop via the
 `DropTarget::enter`, `DropTarget::motion` and
 `DropTarget::leave` signals
 * configuring how to receive data by setting the
 `DropTarget:preload` property and listening for its availability
 via the `DropTarget:value` property

However, `DropTarget` is ultimately modeled in a synchronous way
and only supports data transferred via `glib::Type`.
If you want full control over an ongoing drop, the `DropTargetAsync`
object gives you this ability.

While a pointer is dragged over the drop target's widget and the drop
has not been rejected, that widget will receive the
`StateFlags::DropActive` state, which can be used to style the widget.

# Implements

[`EventControllerExt`](trait.EventControllerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn new -->
Creates a new `DropTarget` object.

If the drop target should support more than 1 type, pass
`G_TYPE_INVALID` for `type_` and then call
`DropTarget::set_gtypes`.
## `type_`
The supported type or `G_TYPE_INVALID`
## `actions`
the supported actions

# Returns

the new `DropTarget`
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_actions -->
Gets the actions that this drop target supports.

# Returns

the actions that this drop target supports
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_drop -->
Gets the currently handled drop operation.

If no drop operation is going on, `None` is returned.

# Returns

The current drop
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_formats -->
Gets the data formats that this drop target accepts.

If the result is `None`, all formats are expected to be supported.

# Returns

the supported data formats
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_gtypes -->
Gets the list of supported `GTypes` for `self`. If no type have been set,
`None` will be returned.
## `n_types`
optional pointer to take the
 number of `GTypes` contained in the return value

# Returns


 `G_TYPE_INVALID`-terminated array of types included in `formats` or
 `None` if none.
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_preload -->
Gets the value of the `DropTarget`:preload property.

# Returns

`true` if drop data should be preloaded
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_value -->
Gets the value of the `DropTarget`:value property.

# Returns

The current drop data
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn reject -->
Rejects the ongoing drop operation.

If no drop operation is ongoing - when `GdkDropTarget`:drop
returns `None` - this function does nothing.

This function should be used when delaying the decision
on whether to accept a drag or not until after reading
the data.
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn set_actions -->
Sets the actions that this drop target supports.
## `actions`
the supported actions
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn set_gtypes -->
Sets the supported `GTypes` for this drop target.

The `DropTarget`::drop signal will
## `types`

 all supported `GTypes` that can be dropped
## `n_types`
number of `types`
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn set_preload -->
Sets the `DropTarget`:preload property.
## `preload`
`true` to preload drop data
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn connect_accept -->
The ::accept signal is emitted on the drop site when a drop operation
is about to begin.
If the drop is not accepted, `false` will be returned and the drop target
will ignore the drop. If `true` is returned, the drop is accepted for now
but may be rejected later via a call to `DropTarget::reject` or
ultimately by returning `false` from `DropTarget`::drop

The default handler for this signal decides whether to accept the drop
based on the formats provided by the `drop`.

If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected needs
inspecting the data, this function should return `true`, the
`DropTarget`:preload property should be set and the value
should be inspected via the GObject::notify:value signal and then call
`DropTarget::reject`.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`

# Returns

`true` if `drop` is accepted
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn connect_drop -->
The ::drop signal is emitted on the drop site when the user drops
the data onto the widget. The signal handler must determine whether
the pointer position is in a drop zone or not. If it is not in a drop
zone, it returns `false` and no further processing is necessary.

Otherwise, the handler returns `true`. In this case, this handler will
accept the drop. The handler is responsible for rading the given `value`
and performing the drop operation.
## `value`
the `gobject::Value` being dropped
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

whether the drop was accepted at the given pointer position
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn connect_enter -->
The ::enter signal is emitted on the drop site when the pointer
enters the widget. It can be used to set up custom highlighting.
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

Preferred action for this drag operation or 0 if dropping is not
 supported at the current `x`,`y` location.
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn connect_leave -->
The ::leave signal is emitted on the drop site when the pointer
leaves the widget. Its main purpose it to undo things done in
`DropTarget::enter`.
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn connect_motion -->
The ::motion signal is emitted while the pointer is moving
over the drop target.
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

Preferred action for this drag operation or 0 if dropping is not
 supported at the current `x`,`y` location.
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_property_actions -->
The ``GdkDragActions`` that this drop target supports
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn set_property_actions -->
The ``GdkDragActions`` that this drop target supports
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_property_drop -->
The `gdk::Drop` that is currently being performed
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_property_formats -->
The `gdk::ContentFormats` that determine the supported data formats
<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_property_preload -->
Whether the drop data should be preloaded when the pointer is only
hovering over the widget but has not been released.

Setting this property allows finer grained reaction to an ongoing
drop at the cost of loading more data.

The default value for this property is `false` to avoid downloading
huge amounts of data by accident.
For example, if somebody drags a full document of gigabytes of text
from a text editor across a widget with a preloading drop target,
this data will be downloaded, even if the data is ultimately dropped
elsewhere.

For a lot of data formats, the amount of data is very small (like
`GDK_TYPE_RGBA`), so enabling this property does not hurt at all.
And for local-only drag'n'drop operations, no data transfer is done,
so enabling it there is free.

<!-- impl DropTarget::fn get_property_value -->
The value for this drop operation or `None` if the data has not been
loaded yet or no drop operation is going on.

Data may be available before the `DropTarget`::drop signal gets emitted -
for example when the `DropTarget`:preload property is set.
You can use the GObject::notify signal to be notified of available data.
<!-- struct DropTargetAsync -->
`DropTargetAsync` is an auxiliary object that can be used to receive
Drag-and-Drop operations.
It is the more complete but also more complex method of handling drop
operations compared to `DropTarget` and you should only use it if
`DropTarget` doesn't provide all the features you need.

To use a `DropTargetAsync` to receive drops on a widget, you create
a `DropTargetAsync` object, configure which data formats and actions
you support, connect to its signals, and then attach
it to the widget with `WidgetExt::add_controller`.

During a drag operation, the first signal that a `DropTargetAsync`
emits is `DropTargetAsync::accept`, which is meant to determine
whether the target is a possible drop site for the ongoing drop.
The default handler for the ::accept signal accepts the drop
if it finds a compatible data format and an action that is supported
on both sides.

If it is, and the widget becomes a target, you will receive a
`DropTargetAsync::drag-enter` signal, followed by
`DropTargetAsync::drag-motion` signals as the pointer moves,
optionally a `DropTargetAsync::drop` signal when a drop happens,
and finally a `DropTargetAsync::drag-leave` signal when the pointer
moves off the widget.

The ::drag-enter and ::drag-motion handler return a `gdk::DragAction`
to update the status of the ongoing operation. The ::drop handler
should decide if it ultimately accepts the drop and if it does, it
should initiate the data transfer and finish the operation by calling
`gdk::Drop::finish`.

Between the ::drag-enter and ::drag-leave signals the widget is a
current drop target, and will receive the `StateFlags::DropActive`
state, which can be used by themes to style the widget as a drop target.

the supported data formats or `None` for
 any format.
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn connect_accept -->
The ::accept signal is emitted on the drop site when a drop operation
is about to begin.

If the drop is not accepted, `false` will be returned and the drop target
will ignore the drop. If `true` is returned, the drop is accepted for now
but may be rejected later via a call to `gtk_drop_target_async_reject` or
ultimately by returning `false` from `DropTargetAsync::drop`.

The default handler for this signal decides whether to accept the drop
based on the formats provided by the `drop`.

If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected needs
further processing, such as inspecting the data, this function should
return `true` and proceed as is `drop` was accepted and if it decides to
reject the drop later, it should call `DropTargetAsync::reject_drop`.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`

# Returns

`true` if `drop` is accepted
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn connect_drag_enter -->
The ::drag-enter signal is emitted on the drop site when the pointer
enters the widget. It can be used to set up custom highlighting.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

Preferred action for this drag operation.
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn connect_drag_leave -->
The ::drag-leave signal is emitted on the drop site when the pointer
leaves the widget. Its main purpose it to undo things done in
`DropTargetAsync::drag-enter`.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn connect_drag_motion -->
The ::drag-motion signal is emitted while the pointer is moving
over the drop target.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

Preferred action for this drag operation.
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn connect_drop -->
The ::drop signal is emitted on the drop site when the user drops
the data onto the widget. The signal handler must determine whether
the pointer position is in a drop zone or not. If it is not in a drop
zone, it returns `false` and no further processing is necessary.

Otherwise, the handler returns `true`. In this case, this handler will
accept the drop. The handler must ensure that `gdk::Drop::finish` is
called to let the source know that the drop is done. The call to
`gdk::Drop::finish` must only be done when all data has been received.

To receive the data, use one of the read functions provides by `gdk::Drop`
such as `gdk::Drop::read_async` or `gdk::Drop::read_value_async`.
## `drop`
the `gdk::Drop`
## `x`
the x coordinate of the current pointer position
## `y`
the y coordinate of the current pointer position

# Returns

whether the drop is accepted at the given pointer position
<!-- impl DropTargetAsync::fn get_property_actions -->

<!-- struct Editable -->
The `Editable` interface is an interface which should be implemented by
text editing widgets, such as `Entry` and `SpinButton`. It contains functions
for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
connect to modify the behavior of a widget.

As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
the following handler to `Editable::insert-text`, an application
can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.

## Forcing entry to uppercase.


```C
#include <ctype.h>

void
insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                     const char  *text,
                     int          length,
                     int         *position,
                     gpointer     data)
{
  char *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);

  g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                               (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
  gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
  g_signal_handlers_unblock_by_func (editable,
                                     (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);

  g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (editable, "insert_text");

  g_free (result);
}
```

## Implementing `Editable`

The most likely scenario for implementing `Editable` on your own widget
is that you will embed a `Text` inside a complex widget, and want to
delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. `Editable`
provides some utility functions to make this easy.

In your class_init function, call `Editable::install_properties`,
passing the first available property ID:


```text
static void
my_class_init (MyClass *class)
{
   ...
   g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
   gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
   ...
}
```

In your interface_init function for the `Editable` interface, provide
an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:


```text
GtkEditable *
get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
{
  return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
}

static void
my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
{
  iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
}
```

You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
work by forwarding to the delegate that the `EditableInterface.get_delegate`()
vfunc returns.

In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
`Editable::init_delegate`:


```text
static void
my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
{
  ...
  self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
  gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
  ...
}
```

In your dispose function, call `Editable::finish_delegate` before
destroying your text widget:


```text
static void
my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
{
  ...
  gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
  g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
  ...
}
```

Finally, use `Editable::delegate_set_property` in your `set_property`
function (and similar for `get_property`), to set the editable properties:


```text
  ...
  if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
    return;

  switch (prop_id)
  ...
```

It is important to note that if you create a `Editable` that uses a delegate,
the low level `Editable::insert-text` and `Editable::delete-text` signals
will be propagated from the "wrapper" editable to the delegate, but they will
not be propagated from the delegate to the "wrapper" editable, as they would
cause an infinite recursion. If you wish to connect to the `Editable::insert-text`
and `Editable::delete-text` signals, you will need to connect to them on
the delegate obtained via `Editable::get_delegate`.

<!-- trait EditableExt::fn init_delegate -->
Sets up a delegate for `Editable`, assuming that the
get_delegate vfunc in the `Editable` interface has been
set up for the `self`'s type.

This is a helper function that should be called in instance init,
after creating the delegate object.
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn insert_text -->
Inserts `length` bytes of `text` into the contents of the
widget, at position `position`.

Note that the position is in characters, not in bytes.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `start_pos`
start of region
## `end_pos`
end of region
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_alignment -->
Sets the alignment for the contents of the editable.

This controls the horizontal positioning of the contents when

Determines if the user can edit the text
in the editable widget or not.
## `is_editable`
`true` if the user is allowed to edit the text
 in the widget
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_enable_undo -->
If enabled, changes to `self` will be saved for undo/redo actions.

The cursor is displayed before the character with the given (base 0)
index in the contents of the editable. The value must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the editable. A value of -1
indicates that the position should be set after the last character
of the editable. Note that `position` is in characters, not in bytes.

<!-- trait EditableExt::fn set_width_chars -->
Changes the size request of the editable to be about the
right size for `n_chars` characters.

Note that it changes the size request, the size can still
be affected by how you pack the widget into containers.
If `n_chars` is -1, the size reverts to the default size.
## `n_chars`
width in chars
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn connect_changed -->
The ::changed signal is emitted at the end of a single
user-visible operation on the contents of the `Editable`.

E.g., a paste operation that replaces the contents of the
selection will cause only one signal emission (even though it
is implemented by first deleting the selection, then inserting
the new content, and may cause multiple ::notify::text signals
to be emitted).
<!-- trait EditableExt::fn connect_delete_text -->
This signal is emitted when text is deleted from
the widget by the user. The default handler for
this signal will normally be responsible for deleting
the text, so by connecting to this signal and then
stopping the signal with `g_signal_stop_emission`, it
is possible to modify the range of deleted text, or
prevent it from being deleted entirely. The `start_pos`
and `end_pos` parameters are interpreted as for
`Editable::delete_text`.
## `start_pos`
the starting position
## `end_pos`
the end position
<!-- trait EditableExtManual::fn connect_insert_text -->
This signal is emitted when text is inserted into
the widget by the user. The default handler for
this signal will normally be responsible for inserting
the text, so by connecting to this signal and then
stopping the signal with `g_signal_stop_emission`, it
is possible to modify the inserted text, or prevent
it from being inserted entirely.
## `text`
the new text to insert
## `length`
the length of the new text, in bytes,
 or -1 if new_text is nul-terminated
## `position`
the position, in characters,
 at which to insert the new text. this is an in-out
 parameter. After the signal emission is finished, it
 should point after the newly inserted text.
<!-- struct EditableLabel -->
A `EditableLabel` is a `Label` that allows users to
edit the text by switching the widget to an “edit mode”.

`EditableLabel` does not have API of its own, but it
implements the `Editable` interface.

The default bindings for activating the edit mode is
to click or press the Enter key. The default bindings
for leaving the edit mode are the Enter key (to save
the results) or the Escape key (to cancel the editing).

# CSS nodes


```plain
editablelabel[.editing]
╰── stack
    ├── label
    ╰── text
```

`EditableLabel` has a main node with the name editablelabel.
When the entry is in editing mode, it gets the .editing style
class.

For all the subnodes added to the text node in various situations,
see `Text`.

<!-- impl EditableLabel::fn get_editing -->
Returns whether the label is currently in “editing mode”.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is currently in editing mode
<!-- impl EditableLabel::fn start_editing -->
Switches the label into “editing mode”.
<!-- impl EditableLabel::fn stop_editing -->
Switches the label out of “editing mode”. If `commit` is `true`,
the resulting text is kept as the `Editable:text` property
value, otherwise the resulting text is discarded and the label
will keep its previous `Editable:text` property value.
## `commit`
whether to set the edited text on the label
<!-- impl EditableLabel::fn get_property_editing -->
This property is `true` while the widget is in edit mode.
<!-- enum EditableProperties -->
<!-- struct EmojiChooser -->
The `EmojiChooser` popover is used by text widgets such as `Entry` or
`TextView` to offer users a convenient way to insert Emoji characters.

`EmojiChooser` emits the `EmojiChooser::emoji-picked` signal when an
Emoji is selected.

# CSS nodes

```plain
popover
├── box.emoji-searchbar
│   ╰── entry.search
╰── box.emoji-toolbar
    ├── button.image-button.emoji-section
    ├── ...
    ╰── button.image-button.emoji-section
```

Every `EmojiChooser` consists of a main node called popover.
The contents of the popover are largely implementation defined
and supposed to inherit general styles.
The top searchbar used to search emoji and gets the .emoji-searchbar
style class itself.
The bottom toolbar used to switch between different emoji categories
consists of buttons with the .emoji-section style class and gets the
.emoji-toolbar style class itself.

<!-- impl EmojiChooser::fn new -->
Creates a new `EmojiChooser`.

# Returns

<!-- impl EmojiChooser::fn connect_emoji_picked -->
The ::emoji-picked signal is emitted when the user selects an
Emoji.
## `text`
the Unicode sequence for the picked Emoji, in UTF-8
<!-- struct Entry -->
The `Entry` widget is a single line text entry
widget. A fairly large set of key bindings are supported
by default. If the entered text is longer than the allocation
of the widget, the widget will scroll so that the cursor
position is visible.

When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
it can be put into “password mode” using `EntryExt::set_visibility`.
In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

`Entry` has the ability to display progress or activity
information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
use `EntryExt::set_progress_fraction` or `EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`.

Additionally, `Entry` can show icons at either side of the entry. These
icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source and
can have tooltips. To add an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_from_gicon` or
one of the various other functions that set an icon from an icon name or a
paintable. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon,
connect to the `Entry::icon-press` signal. To allow DND operations
from an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_drag_source`. To set a tooltip on
an icon, use `EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text` or the corresponding function
for markup.

Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
via the context menu of the entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
entry[.flat][.warning][.error]
├── text[.readonly]
├── image.left
├── image.right
╰── [progress[.pulse]]
```

`Entry` has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties
of the entry, the style classes .read-only and .flat may appear. The style
classes .warning and .error may also be used with entries.

When the entry shows icons, it adds subnodes with the name image and the
style class .left or .right, depending on where the icon appears.

When the entry shows progress, it adds a subnode with the name progress.
The node has the style class .pulse when the shown progress is pulsing.

For all the subnodes added to the text node in various situations,
see `Text`.

# `Entry` as `Buildable`

The `Entry` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
“start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify `pango::Attribute` values for
this label.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:

```text
<object class="GtkEnry">
  <attributes>
    <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
    <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
  </attributes>
</object>
```

The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute is
applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
content instead.

(the amount of movement per pulse is determined by
`EntryExt::set_progress_pulse_step`).
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn reset_im_context -->
Reset the input method context of the entry if needed.

This can be necessary in the case where modifying the buffer
would confuse on-going input method behavior.
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_activates_default -->
If `setting` is `true`, pressing Enter in the `self` will activate the default
widget for the window containing the entry. This usually means that
the dialog box containing the entry will be closed, since the default
widget is usually one of the dialog buttons.
## `setting`

## `icon_pos`
The position at which to set the icon
## `icon`
The icon to set, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_from_icon_name -->

the specified position. `tooltip` is assumed to be marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_text`.

the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_icon_tooltip_text -->
Sets `tooltip` as the contents of the tooltip for the icon
at the specified position.

Use `None` for `tooltip` to remove an existing tooltip.

See also `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text` and
`EntryExt::set_icon_tooltip_markup`.

If you unset the widget tooltip via `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text` or
`WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup`, this sets `Widget`:has-tooltip to `false`,
which suppresses icon tooltips too. You can resolve this by then calling
`WidgetExt::set_has_tooltip` to set `Widget`:has-tooltip back to `true`, or
setting at least one non-empty tooltip on any icon achieves the same result.
## `icon_pos`
the icon position
## `tooltip`
the contents of the tooltip for the icon, or `None`

<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_invisible_char -->
Sets the character to use in place of the actual text when
`EntryExt::set_visibility` has been called to set text visibility
to `false`. i.e. this is the character used in “password mode” to
show the user how many characters have been typed. By default, GTK
picks the best invisible char available in the current font. If you
set the invisible char to 0, then the user will get no feedback
at all; there will be no text on the screen as they type.
## `ch`
a Unicode character
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the widget. If
the current contents are longer than the given length, then they
will be truncated to fit.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and
calling `EntryBuffer::set_max_length` on it.
]|
## `max`

 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.

Sets whether the text is overwritten when typing in the `Entry`.
## `overwrite`
new value
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_placeholder_text -->

This can be used to give a visual hint of the expected contents of
the `Entry`.
## `text`
a string to be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused, or `None`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_fraction -->
Causes the entry’s progress indicator to “fill in” the given
fraction of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_progress_pulse_step -->

text.
## `tabs`
a `pango::TabArray`
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn set_visibility -->
Sets whether the contents of the entry are visible or not.
When visibility is set to `false`, characters are displayed
as the invisible char, and will also appear that way when
the text in the entry widget is copied elsewhere.

By default, GTK picks the best invisible character available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`.

Note that you probably want to set `Entry:input-purpose`
to `InputPurpose::Password` or `InputPurpose::Pin` to
inform input methods about the purpose of this entry,
in addition to setting visibility to `false`.
## `visible`
`true` if the contents of the entry are displayed
 as plaintext
<!-- trait EntryExt::fn unset_invisible_char -->
Unsets the invisible char previously set with
`EntryExt::set_invisible_char`. So that the

The `EntryBuffer` class contains the actual text displayed in a
`Entry` widget.

A single `EntryBuffer` object can be shared by multiple `Entry`
widgets which will then share the same text content, but not the cursor
position, visibility attributes, icon etc.

`EntryBuffer` may be derived from. Such a derived class might allow
text to be stored in an alternate location, such as non-pageable memory,
useful in the case of important passwords. Or a derived class could
integrate with an application’s concept of undo/redo.

# Implements

[`EntryBufferExt`](trait.EntryBufferExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`EntryBufferExtManual`](prelude/trait.EntryBufferExtManual.html)
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt -->
Trait containing all `EntryBuffer` methods.

# Implementors

# Returns

A new `EntryBuffer` object.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn delete_text -->
Deletes a sequence of characters from the buffer. `n_chars` characters are
deleted starting at `position`. If `n_chars` is negative, then all characters
until the end of the text are deleted.

If `position` or `n_chars` are out of bounds, then they are coerced to sane
values.

Note that the positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
## `position`
position at which to delete text
## `n_chars`
number of characters to delete

# Returns

The number of characters deleted.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn emit_deleted_text -->
Used when subclassing `EntryBuffer`

position at which text was deleted
## `n_chars`
number of characters deleted
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn emit_inserted_text -->
Used when subclassing `EntryBuffer`
## `position`
position at which text was inserted

Retrieves the length in characters of the buffer.

# Returns

The number of characters in the buffer.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn get_max_length -->
Retrieves the maximum allowed length of the text in
`self`. See `EntryBuffer::set_max_length`.

# Returns

the maximum allowed number of characters
 in `EntryBuffer`, or 0 if there is no maximum.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the contents of the buffer.

The memory pointer returned by this call will not change
unless this object emits a signal, or is finalized.

 string. This string points to internally allocated
 storage in the buffer and must not be freed, modified or
 stored.
<!-- trait EntryBufferExt::fn insert_text -->
Inserts `n_chars` characters of `chars` into the contents of the
buffer, at position `position`.

If `n_chars` is negative, then characters from chars will be inserted
until a null-terminator is found. If `position` or `n_chars` are out of
bounds, or the maximum buffer text length is exceeded, then they are
coerced to sane values.

Note that the position and length are in characters, not in bytes.
## `position`
the position at which to insert text.

<!-- struct EntryCompletion -->
`EntryCompletion` is an auxiliary object to be used in conjunction with
`Entry` to provide the completion functionality. It implements the
`CellLayout` interface, to allow the user to add extra cells to the
`TreeView` with completion matches.

“Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
in the entry, `EntryCompletion` checks which rows in the model match
the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
`EntryCompletion::set_text_column`), but this can be overridden
with a custom match function (see `EntryCompletion::set_match_func`).

When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
to the `EntryCompletion::match-selected` signal and updating the
entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return `true` from
the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.

To add completion functionality to an entry, use `EntryExt::set_completion`.

`EntryCompletion` uses a `TreeModelFilter` model to represent the
subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the
`EntryCompletion` signals `EntryCompletion::match-selected` and
`EntryCompletion::cursor-on-match` take the original model and an
iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and signals
(such as ``GtkCellLayoutDataFuncs`` or `CellArea::apply-attributes`)
will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
only calling `TreeModel::get`, this will make no difference to
you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
`TreeModelFilterExt::get_model`. Don’t forget to use
`TreeModelFilterExt::convert_iter_to_child_iter` to obtain a
matching iter.

to a descendent). If you are interested in these cases, you
can monitor the `EventControllerFocus:is-focus` property

<!-- struct EventControllerScroll -->
`EventControllerScroll` is an event controller meant to handle
scroll events from mice and touchpads. It is capable of handling
both discrete and continuous scroll events, abstracting them both
on the `EventControllerScroll::scroll` signal (deltas in the
discrete case are multiples of 1).

In the case of continuous scroll events, `EventControllerScroll`
encloses all `EventControllerScroll::scroll` events between two
`EventControllerScroll::scroll-begin` and `EventControllerScroll::scroll-end`
signals.

The behavior of the event controller can be modified by the
flags given at creation time, or modified at a later point through
`EventControllerScroll::set_flags` (e.g. because the scrolling
conditions of the widget changed).

The controller can be set up to emit motion for either/both vertical
and horizontal scroll events through `EventControllerScrollFlags::Vertical`,
`EventControllerScrollFlags::Horizontal` and `EventControllerScrollFlags::BothAxes`.
If any axis is disabled, the respective `EventControllerScroll::scroll`
delta will be 0. Vertical scroll events will be translated to horizontal
motion for the devices incapable of horizontal scrolling.

The event controller can also be forced to emit discrete events on all devices
through `EventControllerScrollFlags::Discrete`. This can be used to implement
discrete actions triggered through scroll events (e.g. switching across
combobox options).

The `EventControllerScrollFlags::Kinetic` flag toggles the emission of the
`EventControllerScroll::decelerate` signal, emitted at the end of scrolling
with two X/Y velocity arguments that are consistent with the motion that
was received.

# Implements

[`EventControllerExt`](trait.EventControllerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl EventControllerScroll::fn new -->
Creates a new event controller that will handle scroll events.

# Implements

[`MultiFilterExt`](trait.MultiFilterExt.html), [`FilterExt`](trait.FilterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl EveryFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new empty "every" filter.
Use `MultiFilterExt::append` to add filters to it.

This filter matches an item if each of the filters added to it
matches the item.
In particular, this means that if no filter has been added to
it, the filter matches every item.

# Returns

a new `EveryFilter`
<!-- struct Expander -->
A `Expander` allows the user to hide or show its child by clicking
on an expander triangle similar to the triangles used in a `TreeView`.

Normally you use an expander as you would use a frame; you create
the child widget and use `Expander::set_child` to add it to the
expander. When the expander is toggled, it will take care of showing
and hiding the child automatically.

# Special Usage

There are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the
expanded widget yourself, such as when you want to actually create
the widget at expansion time. In this case, create a `Expander`
but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an
`Expander:expanded` property which can be used to monitor
its expansion state. You should watch this property with a signal
connection as follows:


```C
static void

# `Expander` as `Buildable`

The `Expander` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can be
specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Expander`:

```plain
expander
╰── box
    ├── title
    │   ├── arrow
    │   ╰── <label widget>
    ╰── <child>
```

`Expander` has three CSS nodes, the main node with the name expander,
a subnode with name title and node below it with name arrow. The arrow of an
expander that is showing its child gets the :checked pseudoclass added to it.

# Accessibility

`Expander` uses the `AccessibleRole::Button` role.

<!-- impl Expander::fn new -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
## `label`
the text of the label

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- impl Expander::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new expander using `label` as the text of the label.
If characters in `label` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined.
If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use “__” (two
underscores). The first underlined character represents a keyboard
accelerator called a mnemonic.
Pressing Alt and that key activates the button.
## `label`
the text of the label with an underscore
 in front of the mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `Expander` widget.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget of `self`.

# Returns

the child widget of `self`
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_expanded -->
Queries a `Expander` and returns its current state. Returns `true`
if the child widget is revealed.

See `Expander::set_expanded`.

# Returns

the current state of the expander
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup, as set by
`Expander::set_label`. If the label text has not been set the
return value will be `None`. This will be the case if you create an
empty button with `Button::new` to use as a container.

Note that this function behaved differently in versions prior to
2.14 and used to return the label text stripped of embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. This problem can
be avoided by fetching the label text directly from the label
widget.

# Returns

The text of the label widget. This string is owned
 by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_label_widget -->
Retrieves the label widget for the frame. See
`Expander::set_label_widget`.

# Returns

the label widget,
 or `None` if there is none
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_resize_toplevel -->
Returns whether the expander will resize the toplevel widget
containing the expander upon resizing and collpasing.

# Returns

the “resize toplevel” setting.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_use_markup -->
Returns whether the label’s text is interpreted as marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `Expander::set_use_markup`.

# Returns

`true` if the label’s text will be parsed for markup
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_use_underline -->
Returns whether an embedded underline in the expander label
indicates a mnemonic. See `Expander::set_use_underline`.

# Returns

`true` if an embedded underline in the expander
 label indicates the mnemonic accelerator keys
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_child -->
Sets the child widget of `self`.
## `child`
the child widget
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_expanded -->
Sets the state of the expander. Set to `true`, if you want
the child widget to be revealed, and `false` if you want the
child widget to be hidden.
## `expanded`
whether the child widget is revealed
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of the label of the expander to `label`.

This will also clear any previously set labels.
## `label`
a string
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_label_widget -->
Set the label widget for the expander. This is the widget
that will appear embedded alongside the expander arrow.
## `label_widget`
the new label widget
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_resize_toplevel -->
Sets whether the expander will resize the toplevel widget
containing the expander upon resizing and collpasing.
## `resize_toplevel`
whether to resize the toplevel
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_use_markup -->
Sets whether the text of the label contains markup in
[Pango’s text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `Label::set_markup`.
## `use_markup`
`true` if the label’s text should be parsed for markup
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text of the expander label indicates
the next character should be used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `use_underline`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- impl Expander::fn connect_activate -->
Activates the `Expander`.
<!-- impl Expander::fn get_property_resize_toplevel -->
When this property is `true`, the expander will resize the toplevel
widget containing the expander upon expanding and collapsing.
<!-- impl Expander::fn set_property_resize_toplevel -->
When this property is `true`, the expander will resize the toplevel
widget containing the expander upon expanding and collapsing.
<!-- struct FileChooser -->
`FileChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by file
selection widgets. In GTK, the main objects that implement this
interface are `FileChooserWidget` and `FileChooserDialog`. You do not
need to write an object that implements the `FileChooser` interface
unless you are trying to adapt an existing file selector to expose a
standard programming interface.

`FileChooser` allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

- Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
 right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
 can be renamed and deleted by the user.

- Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
 program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
 cannot be modified by the user.

- Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
 the “roots” of the filesystem.

# File Names and Encodings

When the user is finished selecting files in a
`FileChooser`, your program can get the selected filenames as
`GFiles`.

# Adding options

You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
that are not present in the default design, by using
`FileChooser::add_choice`. Each choice has an identifier and
a user visible label; additionally, each choice can have multiple
options. If a choice has no option, it will be rendered as a
check button with the given label; if a choice has options, it will
be rendered as a combo box.

# Implements

[`FileChooserExt`](trait.FileChooserExt.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt -->
Trait containing all `FileChooser` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserDialog`](struct.FileChooserDialog.html), [`FileChooserNative`](struct.FileChooserNative.html), [`FileChooserWidget`](struct.FileChooserWidget.html), [`FileChooser`](struct.FileChooser.html)
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_choice -->
Adds a 'choice' to the file chooser. This is typically implemented
as a combobox or, for boolean choices, as a checkbutton. You can select
a value using `FileChooser::set_choice` before the dialog is shown,
and you can obtain the user-selected value in the ::response signal handler
using `FileChooser::get_choice`.
## `id`
id for the added choice
## `label`
user-visible label for the added choice
## `options`
ids for the options of the choice, or `None` for a boolean choice
## `option_labels`
user-visible labels for the options, must be the same length as `options`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_filter -->
Adds `filter` to the list of filters that the user can select between.
When a filter is selected, only files that are passed by that
filter are displayed.

Note that the `self` takes ownership of the filter if it is floating,
so you have to ref and sink it if you want to keep a reference.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn add_shortcut_folder -->
Adds a folder to be displayed with the shortcut folders in a file chooser.
## `folder`
a `gio::File` for the folder to add

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be added successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_action -->
Gets the type of operation that the file chooser is performing; see
`FileChooser::set_action`.

# Returns

the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_choice -->
Gets the currently selected option in the 'choice' with the given ID.
## `id`
the ID of the choice to get

# Returns

the ID of the currently selected option
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_create_folders -->
Gets whether file chooser will offer to create new folders.
See `FileChooser::set_create_folders`.

# Returns

`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_folder -->
Gets the current folder of `self` as `gio::File`.

# Returns

the `gio::File` for the current folder.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_current_name -->
Gets the current name in the file selector, as entered by the user in the
text entry for “Name”.

This is meant to be used in save dialogs, to get the currently typed filename
when the file itself does not exist yet.

# Returns

The raw text from the file chooser’s “Name” entry. Free this with
`g_free`. Note that this string is not a full pathname or URI; it is
whatever the contents of the entry are. Note also that this string is in
UTF-8 encoding, which is not necessarily the system’s encoding for filenames.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_file -->
Gets the `gio::File` for the currently selected file in
the file selector. If multiple files are selected,
one of the files will be returned at random.

If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selected
folder.

# Returns

a selected `gio::File`. You own the returned file;
 use `gobject::ObjectExt::unref` to release it.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_files -->
Lists all the selected files and subfolders in the current folder
of `self` as `gio::File`.

# Returns

a list model containing a `gio::File` for each
 selected file and subfolder in the current folder. Free the returned
 list with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filter -->
Gets the current filter; see `FileChooser::set_filter`.

# Returns

the current filter, or `None`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_filters -->
Gets the current set of user-selectable filters, as a list model; see
`FileChooser::add_filter`, `FileChooser::remove_filter`.

You should not modify the returned list model. Future changes to
`self` may or may not affect the returned model.

# Returns

a `gio::ListModel` containing the current set
 of user-selectable filters.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_select_multiple -->
Gets whether multiple files can be selected in the file
selector. See `FileChooser::set_select_multiple`.

# Returns

`true` if multiple files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_shortcut_folders -->
Queries the list of shortcut folders in the file chooser, as set by
`FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder`.

You should not modify the returned list model. Future changes to
`self` may or may not affect the returned model.

# Returns

A list model of `GFiles`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_choice -->
Removes a 'choice' that has been added with `FileChooser::add_choice`.
## `id`
the ID of the choice to remove
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_filter -->
Removes `filter` from the list of filters that the user can select between.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn remove_shortcut_folder -->
Removes a folder from the shortcut folders in a file chooser.
## `folder`
a `gio::File` for the folder to remove

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be removed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_action -->
Sets the type of operation that the chooser is performing; the
user interface is adapted to suit the selected action. For example,
an option to create a new folder might be shown if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Save` but not if the action is
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `action`
the action that the file selector is performing
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_choice -->
Selects an option in a 'choice' that has been added with
`FileChooser::add_choice`. For a boolean choice, the
possible options are "true" and "false".
## `id`
the ID of the choice to set
## `option`
the ID of the option to select
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_create_folders -->
Sets whether file chooser will offer to create new folders.
This is only relevant if the action is not set to be
`FileChooserAction::Open`.
## `create_folders`
`true` if the Create Folder button should be displayed
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_folder -->
Sets the current folder for `self` from a `gio::File`.
## `file`
the `gio::File` for the new folder

# Returns

`true` if the folder could be changed successfully, `false`
otherwise.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_current_name -->
Sets the current name in the file selector, as if entered
by the user. Note that the name passed in here is a UTF-8
string rather than a filename. This function is meant for
such uses as a suggested name in a “Save As...” dialog. You can
pass “Untitled.doc” or a similarly suitable suggestion for the `name`.

If you want to preselect a particular existing file, you should use
`FileChooser::set_file` instead.

Please see the documentation for those functions for an example of using
`FileChooser::set_current_name` as well.
## `name`
the filename to use, as a UTF-8 string
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_file -->
Sets `file` as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing
to the file’s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list. If
the `self` is in `FileChooserAction::Save` mode, the file’s base name
will also appear in the dialog’s file name entry.

If the file name isn’t in the current folder of `self`, then the current
folder of `self` will be changed to the folder containing `filename`.

Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done except
for the directory change.

If you are implementing a save dialog,
you should use this function if you already have a file name to which the
user may save; for example, when the user opens an existing file and then
does Save As... If you don’t have
a file name already — for example, if the user just created a new
file and is saving it for the first time, do not call this function.
Instead, use something similar to this:

```C
static void
prepare_file_chooser (GtkFileChooser *chooser,
                      GFile          *existing_file)
{
  gboolean document_is_new = (existing_file == NULL);

  if (document_is_new)
    {
      GFile *default_file_for_saving = g_file_new_for_path ("./out.txt");
      // the user just created a new document
      gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder (chooser, default_file_for_saving, NULL);
      gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");
      g_object_unref (default_file_for_saving);
    }
  else
    {
      // the user edited an existing document
      gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file, NULL);
    }
}
```
## `file`
the `gio::File` to set as current

# Returns

Not useful.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_filter -->
Sets the current filter; only the files that pass the
filter will be displayed. If the user-selectable list of filters
is non-empty, then the filter should be one of the filters
in that list. Setting the current filter when the list of
filters is empty is useful if you want to restrict the displayed
set of files without letting the user change it.
## `filter`
a `FileFilter`
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_select_multiple -->
Sets whether multiple files can be selected in the file selector. This is
only relevant if the action is set to be `FileChooserAction::Open` or
`FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.
## `select_multiple`
`true` if multiple files can be selected.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_property_create_folders -->
Whether a file chooser not in `FileChooserAction::Open` mode
will offer the user to create new folders.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn set_property_create_folders -->
Whether a file chooser not in `FileChooserAction::Open` mode
will offer the user to create new folders.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_property_filters -->
A `gio::ListModel` containing the filters that have been
added with `FileChooser::add_filter`.

The returned object should not be modified. It may
or may not be updated for later changes.
<!-- trait FileChooserExt::fn get_property_shortcut_folders -->
A `gio::ListModel` containing the shortcut folders that have been
added with `FileChooser::add_shortcut_folder`.

The returned object should not be modified. It may
or may not be updated for later changes.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction -->
Describes whether a `FileChooser` is being used to open existing files
or to save to a possibly new file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Open -->
Indicates open mode. The file chooser
 will only let the user pick an existing file.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant Save -->
Indicates save mode. The file chooser
 will let the user pick an existing file, or type in a new
 filename.
<!-- enum FileChooserAction::variant SelectFolder -->
Indicates an Open mode for
 selecting folders. The file chooser will let the user pick an
 existing folder.
<!-- struct FileChooserDialog -->
`FileChooserDialog` is a dialog box suitable for use with
“File Open” or “File Save” commands. This widget works by
putting a `FileChooserWidget` inside a `Dialog`. It exposes
the `FileChooser` interface, so you can use all of the
`FileChooser` functions on the file chooser dialog as well as
those for `Dialog`.

Note that `FileChooserDialog` does not have any methods of its
own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
`FileChooser`.

If you want to integrate well with the platform you should use the
`FileChooserNative` API, which will use a platform-specific
dialog if available and fall back to `FileChooserDialog`
otherwise.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkfilechooser`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`FileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:


```text
static void
on_open_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                  int        response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

      g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      open_file (file);
    }

  gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
}

  // ...
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Open"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);

  gtk_widget_show (dialog);

  g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                    G_CALLBACK (on_open_response),
                    NULL);
```

To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:


```text
static void
on_save_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                  int        response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

      g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      save_to_file (file);
    }

  gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
}

  // ...
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooser *chooser;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;

  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Save"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);
  chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

  if (user_edited_a_new_document)
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
  else
    gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_filename);

  gtk_widget_show (dialog);

  g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                    G_CALLBACK (on_save_response),
                    NULL);
```

## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-setting-up}

There are various cases in which you may need to use a `FileChooserDialog`:

- To select a file for opening. Use `FileChooserAction::Open`.

- To save a file for the first time. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with `FileChooser::set_current_name`.

- To save a file under a different name. Use `FileChooserAction::Save`,
 and set the existing file with `FileChooser::set_file`.

- To choose a folder instead of a file. Use `FileChooserAction::SelectFolder`.

Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
using `FileChooser::set_current_folder` in various
situations, with the intention of letting the application
suggest a reasonable default folder. This is no longer
considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
able to make good suggestions on its own. In general, you
should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
when it is appropriate to use `FileChooser::set_file`,
i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
have a file saved somewhere.

## Response Codes ## {`gtkfilechooserdialog`-responses}

`FileChooserDialog` inherits from `Dialog`, so buttons that
go in its action area have response codes such as
`ResponseType::Accept` and `ResponseType::Cancel`. For example, you
could call `FileChooserDialog::new` as follows:


```text
GtkWidget *dialog;
GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                      parent_window,
                                      action,
                                      _("_Cancel"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                      _("_Open"),
                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                      NULL);
```

This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use predefined
response identifiers from `ResponseType`. For most dialog
boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
ones in `ResponseType`, but `FileChooserDialog` assumes that
its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
will have one of the following response codes:

- `ResponseType::Accept`
- `ResponseType::Ok`
- `ResponseType::Yes`
- `ResponseType::Apply`

This is because `FileChooserDialog` must intercept responses
and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
appropriate.

To summarize, make sure you use a
[predefined response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
when you use `FileChooserDialog` to ensure proper operation.

Indicates a duplicate path (e.g. when
 adding a bookmark).
<!-- enum FileChooserError::variant IncompleteHostname -->
Indicates an incomplete hostname
 (e.g. "http://foo" without a slash after that).
<!-- struct FileChooserNative -->
`FileChooserNative` is an abstraction of a dialog box suitable
for use with “File Open” or “File Save as” commands. By default, this
just uses a `FileChooserDialog` to implement the actual dialog.
However, on certain platforms, such as Windows and macOS, the native platform
file chooser is used instead. When the application is running in a
sandboxed environment without direct filesystem access (such as Flatpak),
`FileChooserNative` may call the proper APIs (portals) to let the user
choose a file and make it available to the application.

While the API of `FileChooserNative` closely mirrors `FileChooserDialog`,
the main difference is that there is no access to any `Window` or `Widget`
for the dialog. This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a
platform native dialog.

Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the `NativeDialog`
functions.

## Typical usage ## {`gtkfilechoosernative`-typical-usage}

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`FileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:


```C
static void
on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
             int              response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
      GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      open_file (file);

      g_object_unref (file);
    }

  g_object_unref (native);
}

  // ...
  GtkFileChooserNative *native;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

  native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        "_Open",
                                        "_Cancel");

  g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
  gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
```

To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:


```C
static void
on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
             int              response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
      GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      save_to_file (file);

      g_object_unref (file);
    }

  g_object_unref (native);
}

  // ...
  GtkFileChooserNative *native;
  GtkFileChooser *chooser;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;

  native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        "_Save",
                                        "_Cancel");
  chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);

  if (user_edited_a_new_document)
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
  else
    gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file, NULL);

  g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
  gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
```

For more information on how to best set up a file dialog, see `FileChooserDialog`.

## Response Codes ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-responses}

`FileChooserNative` inherits from `NativeDialog`, which means it
will return `ResponseType::Accept` if the user accepted, and
`ResponseType::Cancel` if he pressed cancel. It can also return
`ResponseType::DeleteEvent` if the window was unexpectedly closed.

## Differences from `FileChooserDialog` ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-differences}

There are a few things in the `FileChooser` API that are not
possible to use with `FileChooserNative`, as such use would
prohibit the use of a native dialog.

No operations that change the dialog work while the dialog is visible.
Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.

## Win32 details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-win32}

On windows the IFileDialog implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
used. It supports many of the features that `FileChooserDialog`
does, but there are some things it does not handle:

* Any `FileFilter` added using a mimetype

If any of these features are used the regular `FileChooserDialog`
will be used in place of the native one.

## Portal details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-portal}

When the org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser portal is available on the
session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser. Depending
on the kind of session the application is running in, this may or may not
be a GTK file chooser.

## macOS details ## {`gtkfilechooserdialognative`-macos}

On macOS the NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel classes are used to provide native
file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by `FileChooserDialog` are
not supported:

* Shortcut folders.

Creates a new `FileChooserWidget`. This is a file chooser widget that can
be embedded in custom windows, and it is the same widget that is used by
`FileChooserDialog`.
## `action`
Open or save mode for the widget

# Returns

a new `FileChooserWidget`
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_desktop_folder -->
The ::desktop-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the user's Desktop
folder in the file list.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + D`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_down_folder -->
The ::down-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the current folder
in the file hierarchy. The subfolder that will be used is displayed in the
path bar widget of the file chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing
"/foo/bar/baz", with bar currently displayed, then this will cause the file
chooser to switch to the "baz" subfolder.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Down`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_home_folder -->
The ::home-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the user's home
folder in the file list.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Home`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_location_popup -->
The ::location-popup signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" prompt which
the user can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select.

The default bindings for this signal are `Control + L` with a `path` string
of "" (the empty string). It is also bound to `/` with a `path` string of
"`/`" (a slash): this lets you type `/` and immediately type a path name.
On Unix systems, this is bound to `~` (tilde) with a `path` string of "~"
itself for access to home directories.
## `path`
a string that gets put in the text entry for the file name
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_location_popup_on_paste -->
The ::location-popup-on-paste signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" prompt when the user
pastes into a `FileChooserWidget`.

The default binding for this signal is `Control + V`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_location_toggle_popup -->
The ::location-toggle-popup signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to toggle the visibility of a "Location" prompt which the user
can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select.

The default binding for this signal is `Control + L`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_places_shortcut -->
The ::places-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to move the focus to the places sidebar.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + P`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_quick_bookmark -->
The ::quick-bookmark signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser switch to the bookmark specified
in the `bookmark_index` parameter. For example, if you have three bookmarks,
you can pass 0, 1, 2 to this signal to switch to each of them, respectively.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + 1`, `Alt + 2`,
etc. until `Alt + 0`. Note that in the default binding, that
`Alt + 1` is actually defined to switch to the bookmark at index
0, and so on successively; `Alt + 0` is defined to switch to the
bookmark at index 10.
## `bookmark_index`
the number of the bookmark to switch to
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_recent_shortcut -->
The ::recent-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the Recent location.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + R`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_search_shortcut -->
The ::search-shortcut signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser show the search entry.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + S`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_show_hidden -->
The ::show-hidden signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser display hidden files.

The default binding for this signal is `Control + H`.
<!-- impl FileChooserWidget::fn connect_up_folder -->
The ::up-folder signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user asks for it.

This is used to make the file chooser go to the parent of the current folder
in the file hierarchy.

The default binding for this signal is `Alt + Up`.
<!-- struct FileFilter -->
A `FileFilter` can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
`FileChooser`. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
`FileFilter::add_pattern`) or on their mime type (with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`).

Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
text/plain. Note that `FileFilter` allows wildcards for the
subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.

Normally, file filters are used by adding them to a `FileChooser`
(see `FileChooser::add_filter`), but it is also possible to
manually use a file filter on any `FilterListModel` containing
`gio::FileInfo` objects.

# `FileFilter` as `Buildable`

The `FileFilter` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>` and `<patterns>`
elements and listing the rules within. Specifying a `<mime-type>`
or `<pattern>` has the same effect as as calling
`FileFilter::add_mime_type` or `FileFilter::add_pattern`.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying `FileFilter`
rules:

```text
<object class="GtkFileFilter">
  <property name="name" translatable="yes">Text and Images</property>
  <mime-types>
    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
    <mime-type>image/ *</mime-type>
  </mime-types>
  <patterns>
    <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
    <pattern>*.png</pattern>
  </patterns>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`FilterExt`](trait.FilterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn new -->
Creates a new `FileFilter` with no rules added to it.

Such a filter doesn’t accept any files, so is not
particularly useful until you add rules with
`FileFilter::add_mime_type`, `FileFilter::add_pattern`,
or `FileFilter::add_pixbuf_formats`.

To create a filter that accepts any file, use:

```C
GtkFileFilter *filter = gtk_file_filter_new ();
gtk_file_filter_add_pattern (filter, "*");
```

# Returns

a new `FileFilter`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn new_from_gvariant -->
Deserialize a file filter from an a{sv} variant in
the format produced by `FileFilter::to_gvariant`.
## `variant`
an a{sv} `glib::Variant`

# Returns

a new `FileFilter` object
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_mime_type -->
Adds a rule allowing a given mime type to `self`.
## `mime_type`
name of a MIME type
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pattern -->
Adds a rule allowing a shell style glob to a filter.
## `pattern`
a shell style glob
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn add_pixbuf_formats -->
Adds a rule allowing image files in the formats supported
by `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`.

This is equivalent to calling `FileFilter::add_mime_type`
for all the supported mime types.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_attributes -->
Gets the attributes that need to be filled in for the `gio::FileInfo`
passed to this filter.

This function will not typically be used by applications;
it is intended principally for use in the implementation
of `FileChooser`.

# Returns

the attributes
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_name -->
Gets the human-readable name for the filter. See `FileFilter::set_name`.

# Returns

The human-readable name of the filter,
 or `None`. This value is owned by GTK and must not
 be modified or freed.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn set_name -->
Sets a human-readable name of the filter; this is the string
that will be displayed in the file chooser if there is a selectable
list of filters.
## `name`
the human-readable-name for the filter, or `None`
 to remove any existing name.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn to_gvariant -->
Serialize a file filter to an a{sv} variant.

# Returns

a new, floating, `glib::Variant`
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn get_property_name -->
The human-readable name of the filter.

This is the string that will be displayed in the file selector user
interface if there is a selectable list of filters.
<!-- impl FileFilter::fn set_property_name -->
The human-readable name of the filter.

This is the string that will be displayed in the file selector user
interface if there is a selectable list of filters.
<!-- struct Filter -->
A `Filter` object describes the filtering to be performed by a
`FilterListModel`.

The model will use the filter to determine if it should include items
or not by calling `FilterExt::match` for each item and only keeping the
ones that the function returns `true` for.

Filters may change what items they match through their lifetime. In that
case, they will emit the `Filter::changed` signal to notify that previous
filter results are no longer valid and that items should be checked again
via `FilterExt::match`.

GTK provides various pre-made filter implementations for common filtering
operations. These filters often include properties that can be linked to
various widgets to easily allow searches.

However, in particular for large lists or complex search methods, it is
also possible to subclass `Filter` and provide one's own filter.

# Implements

[`FilterExt`](trait.FilterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait FilterExt -->
Trait containing all `Filter` methods.

# Implementors

[`BoolFilter`](struct.BoolFilter.html), [`CustomFilter`](struct.CustomFilter.html), [`FileFilter`](struct.FileFilter.html), [`Filter`](struct.Filter.html), [`MultiFilter`](struct.MultiFilter.html), [`StringFilter`](struct.StringFilter.html)
<!-- trait FilterExt::fn changed -->
Emits the `Filter::changed` signal to notify all users of the filter that
the filter changed. Users of the filter should then check items again via
`FilterExt::match`.

Depending on the `change` parameter, not all items need to be changed, but
only some. Refer to the `FilterChange` documentation for details.

This function is intended for implementors of `Filter` subclasses and
should not be called from other functions.
## `change`
How the filter changed
<!-- trait FilterExt::fn get_strictness -->
Gets the known strictness of `filters`. If the strictness is not known,
`FilterMatch::Some` is returned.

This value may change after emission of the `Filter::changed` signal.

This function is meant purely for optimization purposes, filters can
choose to omit implementing it, but `FilterListModel` uses it.

# Returns

the strictness of `self`
<!-- trait FilterExt::fn match -->
Checks if the given `item` is matched by the filter or not.
## `item`
The item to check

# Returns

`true` if the filter matches the item and a filter model should
 keep it, `false` if not.
<!-- trait FilterExt::fn connect_changed -->
This signal is emitted whenever the filter changed. Users of the filter
should then check items again via `FilterExt::match`.

`FilterListModel` handles this signal automatically.

Depending on the `change` parameter, not all items need to be changed, but
only some. Refer to the `FilterChange` documentation for details.
## `change`
how the filter changed
<!-- enum FilterChange -->
Describes changes in a filter in more detail and allows objects
using the filter to optimize refiltering items.

If you are writing an implementation and are not sure which
value to pass, `FilterChange::Different` is always a correct
choice.
<!-- enum FilterChange::variant Different -->
The filter change cannot be
 described with any of the other enumeration values.
<!-- enum FilterChange::variant LessStrict -->
The filter is less strict than
 it was before: All items that it used to return `true` for
 still return `true`, others now may, too.
<!-- enum FilterChange::variant MoreStrict -->
The filter is more strict than
 it was before: All items that it used to return `false` for
 still return `false`, others now may, too.
<!-- struct FilterListModel -->
`FilterListModel` is a list model that filters a given other
listmodel.
It hides some elements from the other model according to
criteria given by a `Filter`.

The model can be set up to do incremental searching, so that
filtering long lists doesn't block the UI. See
`FilterListModel::set_incremental` for details.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn new -->
Creates a new `FilterListModel` that will filter `model` using the given
`filter`.
## `model`
the model to sort, or `None`
## `filter`
filter or `None` to not filter items

# Returns

a new `FilterListModel`
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_filter -->
Gets the `Filter` currently set on `self`.

# Returns

The filter currently in use
 or `None` if the list isn't filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_incremental -->
Returns whether incremental filtering was enabled via
`FilterListModel::set_incremental`.

# Returns

`true` if incremental filtering is enabled
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_model -->
Gets the model currently filtered or `None` if none.

# Returns

The model that gets filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_pending -->
Returns the number of items that have not been filtered yet.

You can use this value to check if `self` is busy filtering by
comparing the return value to 0 or you can compute the percentage
of the filter remaining by dividing the return value by the total
number of items in the underlying model:


```text
  pending = gtk_filter_list_model_get_pending (self);
  model = gtk_filter_list_model_get_model (self);
  percentage = pending / (double) g_list_model_get_n_items (model);
```

If no filter operation is ongoing - in particular when
`FilterListModel:incremental` is `false` - this function returns 0.

# Returns

The number of items not yet filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_filter -->
Sets the filter used to filter items.
## `filter`
filter to use or `None` to not filter items
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_incremental -->
When incremental filtering is enabled, the `FilterListModel` will not
run filters immediately, but will instead queue an idle handler that
incrementally filters the items and adds them to the list. This of course
means that items are not instantly added to the list, but only appear
incrementally.

When your filter blocks the UI while filtering, you might consider
turning this on. Depending on your model and filters, this may become
interesting around 10,000 to 100,000 items.

By default, incremental filtering is disabled.

See `FilterListModel::get_pending` for progress information
about an ongoing incremental filtering operation.
## `incremental`
`true` to enable incremental filtering
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_model -->
Sets the model to be filtered.

Note that GTK makes no effort to ensure that `model` conforms to
the item type of `self`. It assumes that the caller knows what they
are doing and have set up an appropriate filter to ensure that item
types match.
## `model`
The model to be filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_property_filter -->
The filter for this model
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_property_filter -->
The filter for this model
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_property_incremental -->
If the model should filter items incrementally
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_property_incremental -->
If the model should filter items incrementally
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_property_model -->
The model being filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn set_property_model -->
The model being filtered
<!-- impl FilterListModel::fn get_property_pending -->
Number of items not yet filtered
<!-- enum FilterMatch -->
Describes the known strictness of a filter.

Note that for filters where the strictness is not known,
`FilterMatch::Some` is always an acceptable value,
even if a filter does match all or no items.
<!-- enum FilterMatch::variant Some -->
The filter matches some items,
 `FilterExt::match` may return `true` or `false`
<!-- enum FilterMatch::variant None -->
The filter does not match any item,
 `FilterExt::match` will always return `false`.
<!-- enum FilterMatch::variant All -->
The filter matches all items,
 `FilterExt::match` will alays return `true`.
<!-- struct Fixed -->
The `Fixed` widget is a container which can place child widgets
at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. `Fixed`
performs no automatic layout management.

For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
results in broken applications. With `Fixed`, the following
things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
other display bugs:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 cases.

In addition, `Fixed` does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order containers
appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
thing they label when using an RTL language, but it can’t do that with
`Fixed`. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
application.

If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
and prefer the simplicity of `Fixed`, by all means use the
widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.

## `y`
the vertical position to move the widget to.
<!-- trait FixedExt::fn put -->
Adds a widget to a `Fixed` container and assigns a translation
transformation to the given `x` and `y` coordinates to it.

the vertical position to place the widget at.
<!-- trait FixedExt::fn remove -->
Removes a child from `self`, after it has been added
with `FixedExt::put`.

## `transform`
the transformation assigned to `widget` or `None`
 to reset `widget`'s transform
<!-- struct FixedLayout -->
`FixedLayout` is a layout manager which can place child widgets
at fixed positions, and with fixed sizes.

Most applications should never use this layout manager; fixed positioning
and sizing requires constant recalculations on where children need to be
positioned and sized. Other layout managers perform this kind of work
internally so that application developers don't need to do it. Specifically,
widgets positioned in a fixed layout manager will need to take into account:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different
 fonts.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 cases.

In addition, `FixedLayout` does not pay attention to text direction and
thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
containers appropriately depending on the text direction, e.g. to put labels
to the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language;
`FixedLayout` won't be able to do that for you.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove GUI
elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This is a
long-term maintenance problem for your application.

<!-- struct FlattenListModel -->
`FlattenListModel` is a list model that takes a list model containing
list models and flattens it into a single model.

Another term for this is concatenation: `FlattenListModel` takes a
list of lists and concatenates them into a single list.

<!-- struct FlowBox -->
A `FlowBox` positions child widgets in sequence according to its
orientation.

For instance, with the horizontal orientation, the widgets will be
arranged from left to right, starting a new row under the previous
row when necessary. Reducing the width in this case will require more
rows, so a larger height will be requested.

Likewise, with the vertical orientation, the widgets will be arranged
from top to bottom, starting a new column to the right when necessary.
Reducing the height will require more columns, so a larger width will
be requested.

The size request of a `FlowBox` alone may not be what you expect; if you
need to be able to shrink it along both axes and dynamically reflow its
children, you may have to wrap it in a `ScrolledWindow` to enable that.

The children of a `FlowBox` can be dynamically sorted and filtered.

Although a `FlowBox` must have only `FlowBoxChild` children,
you can add any kind of widget to it via `FlowBox::insert`, and
a `FlowBoxChild` widget will automatically be inserted between
the box and the widget.

Also see `ListBox`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
flowbox
├── flowboxchild
│   ╰── <child>
├── flowboxchild
│   ╰── <child>
┊
╰── [rubberband]
```

`FlowBox` uses a single CSS node with name flowbox. `FlowBoxChild`
uses a single CSS node with name flowboxchild.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

# Accessibility

`FlowBox` uses the `AccessibleRole::Grid` role, and `FlowBoxChild`
uses the `AccessibleRole::GridCell` role.

<!-- impl FlowBox::fn bind_model -->
Binds `model` to `self`.

If `self` was already bound to a model, that previous binding is
destroyed.

The contents of `self` are cleared and then filled with widgets that
represent items from `model`. `self` is updated whenever `model` changes.
If `model` is `None`, `self` is left empty.

It is undefined to add or remove widgets directly (for example, with
`FlowBox::insert`) while `self` is bound to a
model.

Note that using a model is incompatible with the filtering and sorting
functionality in `FlowBox`. When using a model, filtering and sorting
should be implemented by the model.

The `filter_func` will be called for each child after the call, and
it will continue to be called each time a child changes (via
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed`) or when `FlowBox::invalidate_filter`
is called.

Note that using a filter function is incompatible with using a model
(see `FlowBox::bind_model`).
## `filter_func`

By setting a sort function on the `self`, one can dynamically
reorder the children of the box, based on the contents of
the children.

The `sort_func` will be called for each child after the call,
and will continue to be called each time a child changes (via
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed`) and when `FlowBox::invalidate_sort`
is called.

Note that using a sort function is incompatible with using a model
(see `FlowBox::bind_model`).

`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifier does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.

<!-- impl FlowBoxChild::fn new -->
Creates a new `FlowBoxChild`, to be used as a child
of a `FlowBox`.

# Returns

a new `FlowBoxChild`
<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting and filtering.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the sorting and filtering functions. For instance, if
the list is mirroring some external data set, and *two* children
changed in the external data set when you call
`FlowBoxChildExt::changed` on the first child, the sort function
must only read the new data for the first of the two changed
children, otherwise the resorting of the children will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model, you have to duplicate the data that affects the sorting
and filtering functions into the widgets themselves. Another
alternative is to call `FlowBox::invalidate_sort` on any
model change, but that is more expensive.
<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget of `self`.

# Returns

the child widget of `self`
<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn get_index -->

<!-- trait FlowBoxChildExt::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal is emitted when the user activates
a child widget in a `FlowBox`, either by clicking or
double-clicking, or by using the Space or Enter key.

While this signal is used as a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`],
it can be used by applications for their own purposes.

Gets the currently-selected font name.

Note that this can be a different string than what you set with
`FontChooser::set_font`, as the font chooser widget may
normalize font names and thus return a string with a different

<!-- struct Frame -->
The frame widget is a widget that surrounds its child with a decorative
frame and an optional label. If present, the label is drawn inside
the top edge of the frame. The horizontal position of the label can
be controlled with `FrameExt::set_label_align`.

`Frame` clips its child. You can use this to add rounded corners to
widgets, but be aware that it also cuts off shadows.

# `Frame` as `Buildable`

The `Frame` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can
be specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Frame`:

```plain
frame
├── <label widget>
╰── <child>
```

`Frame` has a main CSS node with name “frame”, which is used to draw the
visible border. You can set the appearance of the border using CSS properties
like “border-style” on this node.

<!-- struct GLArea -->
`GLArea` is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL.

`GLArea` sets up its own `gdk::GLContext` for the window it creates, and
creates a custom GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto.
It also ensures that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target
when rendering.

In order to draw, you have to connect to the `GLArea::render` signal,
or subclass `GLArea` and override the `GLAreaClass.render`() virtual
function.

The `GLArea` widget ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` is associated with
the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
position of the drawing area changes.

## Drawing with `GLArea` ##

The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a `GLArea` is to
create a widget instance and connect to the `GLArea::render` signal:


```C

```

The `render()` function will be called when the `GLArea` is ready
for you to draw its content:


```C
  static gboolean
  render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
  {
    // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
    // #GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
    // surface used by the #GtkGLArea and the viewport has
    // already been set to be the size of the allocation

    // we can start by clearing the buffer
    glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
    glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // draw your object
    // draw_an_object ();

    // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
    // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
    // the buffers will be drawn on the window
    return TRUE;
  }

  void setup_glarea (void)
  {
    // create a GtkGLArea instance
    GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();

    // connect to the "render" signal
    g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
  }
```

If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
shaders, you should use the `Widget::realize` signal; you
can use the `Widget::unrealize` signal to clean up. Since the
`gdk::GLContext` creation and initialization may fail, you will
need to check for errors, using `GLAreaExt::get_error`. An example
of how to safely initialize the GL state is:


```C
  static void
  on_realize (GtkGLarea *area)
  {
    // We need to make the context current if we want to
    // call GL API
    gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);

    // If there were errors during the initialization or
    // when trying to make the context current, this
    // function will return a #GError for you to catch
    if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
      return;

    // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order
    // to show eventual initialization errors on the
    // GtkGLArea widget itself
    GError *internal_error = NULL;
    init_buffer_objects (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }

    init_shaders (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }
  }
```

If you need to change the options for creating the `gdk::GLContext`
you should use the `GLArea::create-context` signal.

Ensures that the `self` framebuffer object is made the current draw
and read target, and that all the required buffers for the `self`
are created and bound to the framebuffer.

This function is automatically called before emitting the
`GLArea::render` signal, and doesn't normally need to be called
by application code.

using `GLAreaExt::set_required_version`.
## `major`
return location for the required major version

return location for the required minor version
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_use_es -->
Retrieves the value set by `GLAreaExt::set_use_es`.

# Returns

`true` if the `GLArea` should create an OpenGL ES context
 and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn make_current -->
Ensures that the `gdk::GLContext` used by `self` is associated with
the `GLArea`.

This function is automatically called before emitting the
`GLArea::render` signal, and doesn't normally need to be called
by application code.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn queue_render -->
Marks the currently rendered data (if any) as invalid, and queues
a redraw of the widget, ensuring that the `GLArea::render` signal
is emitted during the draw.

This is only needed when the `GLAreaExt::set_auto_render` has
been called with a `false` value. The default behaviour is to
emit `GLArea::render` on each draw.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_auto_render -->
If `auto_render` is `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be
emitted every time the widget draws. This is the default and is
useful if drawing the widget is faster.

If `auto_render` is `false` the data from previous rendering is kept
around and will be used for drawing the widget the next time,
unless the window is resized. In order to force a rendering
`GLAreaExt::queue_render` must be called. This mode is useful when
the scene changes seldom, but takes a long time to redraw.
## `auto_render`
a boolean
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_error -->
Sets an error on the area which will be shown instead of the
GL rendering. This is useful in the `GLArea::create-context`
signal if GL context creation fails.
## `error`
a new `glib::Error`, or `None` to unset the error
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_has_depth_buffer -->
If `has_depth_buffer` is `true` the widget will allocate and
enable a depth buffer for the target framebuffer. Otherwise
there will be none.
## `has_depth_buffer`
`true` to add a depth buffer
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_has_stencil_buffer -->
If `has_stencil_buffer` is `true` the widget will allocate and
enable a stencil buffer for the target framebuffer. Otherwise
there will be none.
## `has_stencil_buffer`
`true` to add a stencil buffer
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_required_version -->
Sets the required version of OpenGL to be used when creating the context
for the widget.

This function must be called before the area has been realized.
## `major`
the major version
## `minor`
the minor version
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_use_es -->
Sets whether the `self` should create an OpenGL or an OpenGL ES context.

You should check the capabilities of the `gdk::GLContext` before drawing
with either API.
## `use_es`
whether to use OpenGL or OpenGL ES
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_create_context -->
The ::create-context signal is emitted when the widget is being
realized, and allows you to override how the GL context is
created. This is useful when you want to reuse an existing GL
context, or if you want to try creating different kinds of GL
options.

If context creation fails then the signal handler can use
`GLAreaExt::set_error` to register a more detailed error
of how the construction failed.

# Returns

a newly created `gdk::GLContext`;
 the `GLArea` widget will take ownership of the returned value.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_render -->
The ::render signal is emitted every time the contents
of the `GLArea` should be redrawn.

The `context` is bound to the `area` prior to emitting this function,
and the buffers are painted to the window once the emission terminates.
## `context`
the `gdk::GLContext` used by `area`

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
 `false` to propagate the event further.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn connect_resize -->
The ::resize signal is emitted once when the widget is realized, and
then each time the widget is changed while realized. This is useful
in order to keep GL state up to date with the widget size, like for
instance camera properties which may depend on the width/height ratio.

The GL context for the area is guaranteed to be current when this signal
is emitted.

The default handler sets up the GL viewport.
## `width`
the width of the viewport
## `height`
the height of the viewport
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_auto_render -->
If set to `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be emitted every time
the widget draws. This is the default and is useful if drawing the widget
is faster.

If set to `false` the data from previous rendering is kept around and will
be used for drawing the widget the next time, unless the window is resized.
In order to force a rendering `GLAreaExt::queue_render` must be called.
This mode is useful when the scene changes seldom, but takes a long time
to redraw.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_auto_render -->
If set to `true` the `GLArea::render` signal will be emitted every time
the widget draws. This is the default and is useful if drawing the widget
is faster.

If set to `false` the data from previous rendering is kept around and will
be used for drawing the widget the next time, unless the window is resized.

<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_context -->
The `gdk::GLContext` used by the `GLArea` widget.

The `GLArea` widget is responsible for creating the `gdk::GLContext`
instance. If you need to render with other kinds of buffers (stencil,
depth, etc), use render buffers.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_has_depth_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a depth buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_has_depth_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a depth buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_has_stencil_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a stencil buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_has_stencil_buffer -->
If set to `true` the widget will allocate and enable a stencil buffer for the
target framebuffer.
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn get_property_use_es -->
If set to `true` the widget will try to create a `gdk::GLContext` using
OpenGL ES instead of OpenGL.

See also: `gdk::GLContext::set_use_es`
<!-- trait GLAreaExt::fn set_property_use_es -->
If set to `true` the widget will try to create a `gdk::GLContext` using
OpenGL ES instead of OpenGL.

<!-- struct Gesture -->
`Gesture` is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
the special `None` `gdk::EventSequence` value for these).

The number of touches that a `Gesture` need to be recognized is controlled
by the `Gesture:n-points` property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
or more than that number of sequences, it won't check whether the gesture
is recognized.

As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
"recognized" is left to `Gesture` subclasses.

A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
- `Gesture::begin` when the gesture is recognized.
- A number of `Gesture::update`, whenever an input event is processed.
- `Gesture::end` when the gesture is no longer recognized.

## Event propagation

In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
through `EventControllerExt::set_propagation_phase`.

In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.

In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.

## States of a sequence # {`touch`-sequence-states}

Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
``GtkGestures``, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the ``GdkEventSequences``
triggering those.

Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through `GestureExt::group`,
grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
`GestureExt::set_sequence_state` on one will effectively propagate
the state throughout the group.

By default, all sequences start out in the `EventSequenceState::None` state,
sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.

If a sequence enters into the `EventSequenceState::Denied` state, the gesture
group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
the touch is active.

If a sequence enters in the `EventSequenceState::Claimed` state, the gesture
group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
- Setting the same sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied` on every other gesture
 group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
 chain.
- calling `Gesture::cancel` on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
 propagation chain.
- Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.

Note: if a sequence is set early to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on
`gdk::EventType::TouchBegin`/`gdk::EventType::ButtonPress` (so those events are captured before
reaching the event widget, this implies `PropagationPhase::Capture`), one similar
event will emulated if the sequence changes to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.
This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
again.

Sequence states can't be changed freely, see `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`
to know about the possible lifetimes of a `gdk::EventSequence`.

## Touchpad gestures

On the platforms that support it, `Gesture` will handle transparently
touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of `Gesture` should do
to enable this support are:
- Enabling `GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK` on their ``GdkSurfaces``
- If the gesture has `PropagationPhase::None`, ensuring events of type
 `gdk::EventType::TouchpadSwipe` and `gdk::EventType::TouchpadPinch` are handled by the `Gesture`

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_bounding_box -->
If there are touch sequences being currently handled by `self`,
this function returns `true` and fills in `rect` with the bounding
box containing all active touches. Otherwise, `false` will be
returned.

Note: This function will yield unexpected results on touchpad
gestures. Since there is no correlation between physical and
pixel distances, these will look as if constrained in an
infinitely small area, `rect` width and height will thus be 0
regardless of the number of touchpoints.
## `rect`
bounding box containing all active touches.

# Returns

`true` if there are active touches, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_bounding_box_center -->
If there are touch sequences being currently handled by `self`,
this function returns `true` and fills in `x` and `y` with the center
of the bounding box containing all active touches. Otherwise, `false`
will be returned.
## `x`
X coordinate for the bounding box center
## `y`
Y coordinate for the bounding box center

# Returns

`false` if no active touches are present, `true` otherwise

a copy of the event.
## `sequence`

# Returns

The last event from `sequence`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_last_updated_sequence -->
Returns the `gdk::EventSequence` that was last updated on `self`.

# Returns

The last updated sequence
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_point -->
If `sequence` is currently being interpreted by `self`, this
function returns `true` and fills in `x` and `y` with the last coordinates
stored for that event sequence. The coordinates are always relative to the
widget allocation.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`, or `None` for pointer events
## `x`
return location for X axis of the sequence coordinates
## `y`
return location for Y axis of the sequence coordinates

# Returns

`true` if `sequence` is currently interpreted
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_sequence_state -->
Returns the `sequence` state, as seen by `self`.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`

# Returns

The sequence state in `self`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_sequences -->
Returns the list of ``GdkEventSequences`` currently being interpreted
by `self`.

# Returns

A list
 of ``GdkEventSequences``, the list elements are owned by GTK
 and must not be freed or modified, the list itself must be deleted
 through `glib::List::free`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn group -->
Adds `gesture` to the same group than `self`. Gestures
are by default isolated in their own groups.

Both gestures must have been added to the same widget before they
can be grouped.

When gestures are grouped, the state of ``GdkEventSequences``
is kept in sync for all of those, so calling `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`,
on one will transfer the same value to the others.

Groups also perform an "implicit grabbing" of sequences, if a
`gdk::EventSequence` state is set to `EventSequenceState::Claimed` on one group,
every other gesture group attached to the same `Widget` will switch the
state for that sequence to `EventSequenceState::Denied`.
## `gesture`
a `Gesture`
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn handles_sequence -->
Returns `true` if `self` is currently handling events corresponding to
`sequence`.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence` or `None`

# Returns

`true` if `self` is handling `sequence`, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_active -->
Returns `true` if the gesture is currently active.
A gesture is active meanwhile there are touch sequences
interacting with it.

# Returns

`true` if gesture is active
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_grouped_with -->
Returns `true` if both gestures pertain to the same group.
## `other`
another `Gesture`

# Returns

whether the gestures are grouped
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn is_recognized -->
Returns `true` if the gesture is currently recognized.
A gesture is recognized if there are as many interacting
touch sequences as required by `self`.

# Returns

`true` if gesture is recognized
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_sequence_state -->
Sets the state of `sequence` in `self`. Sequences start
in state `EventSequenceState::None`, and whenever they change
state, they can never go back to that state. Likewise,
sequences in state `EventSequenceState::Denied` cannot turn
back to a not denied state. With these rules, the lifetime
of an event sequence is constrained to the next four:

* None
* None → Denied
* None → Claimed
* None → Claimed → Denied

Note: Due to event handling ordering, it may be unsafe to
set the state on another gesture within a `Gesture::begin`
signal handler, as the callback might be executed before
the other gesture knows about the sequence. A safe way to
perform this could be:


```text
static void
first_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *first_gesture,
                        GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                        gpointer          user_data)
{
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED);
  gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}

static void
second_gesture_begin_cb (GtkGesture       *second_gesture,
                         GdkEventSequence *sequence,
                         gpointer          user_data)
{
  if (gtk_gesture_get_sequence_state (first_gesture, sequence) == GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED)
    gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state (second_gesture, sequence, GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED);
}
```

If both gestures are in the same group, just set the state on
the gesture emitting the event, the sequence will be already
be initialized to the group's global state when the second
gesture processes the event.
## `sequence`
a `gdk::EventSequence`
## `state`
the sequence state

# Returns

`true` if `sequence` is handled by `self`,
 and the state is changed successfully
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the state of all sequences that `self` is currently
interacting with. See `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`
for more details on sequence states.

`true` if the state of at least one sequence
 was changed successfully
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn ungroup -->
Separates `self` into an isolated group.
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_begin -->
This signal is emitted when the gesture is recognized. This means the
number of touch sequences matches `Gesture:n-points`.

Note: These conditions may also happen when an extra touch (eg. a third touch
on a 2-touches gesture) is lifted, in that situation `sequence` won't pertain
to the current set of active touches, so don't rely on this being true.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that made the gesture to be recognized
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_cancel -->
This signal is emitted whenever a sequence is cancelled. This usually
happens on active touches when `EventControllerExt::reset` is called
on `gesture` (manually, due to grabs...), or the individual `sequence`
was claimed by parent widgets' controllers (see `GestureExt::set_sequence_state`).

`gesture` must forget everything about `sequence` as a reaction to this signal.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was cancelled
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_end -->
This signal is emitted when `gesture` either stopped recognizing the event
sequences as something to be handled, or the number of touch sequences became
higher or lower than `Gesture:n-points`.

Note: `sequence` might not pertain to the group of sequences that were
previously triggering recognition on `gesture` (ie. a just pressed touch
sequence that exceeds `Gesture:n-points`). This situation may be detected
by checking through `GestureExt::handles_sequence`.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that made gesture recognition to finish
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_sequence_state_changed -->
This signal is emitted whenever a sequence state changes. See
`GestureExt::set_sequence_state` to know more about the expectable
sequence lifetimes.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was cancelled
## `state`
the new sequence state
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn connect_update -->
This signal is emitted whenever an event is handled while the gesture is
recognized. `sequence` is guaranteed to pertain to the set of active touches.
## `sequence`
the `gdk::EventSequence` that was updated
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn get_property_n_points -->
The number of touch points that trigger recognition on this gesture,
<!-- trait GestureExt::fn set_property_n_points -->
The number of touch points that trigger recognition on this gesture,
<!-- struct GestureClick -->
`GestureClick` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
multiple clicks on a nearby zone, which can be listened for through
the `GestureClick::pressed` signal. Whenever time or distance
between clicks exceed the GTK defaults, `GestureClick::stopped`
is emitted, and the click counter is reset.

## `y`
The Y coordinate, in widget allocation coordinates
<!-- impl GestureClick::fn connect_released -->
This signal is emitted when a button or touch is released. `n_press`
will report the number of press that is paired to this event, note
that `GestureClick::stopped` may have been emitted between the
press and its release, `n_press` will only start over at the next press.
## `n_press`
number of press that is paired with this release
## `x`
The X coordinate, in widget allocation coordinates
## `y`
The Y coordinate, in widget allocation coordinates

This signal is emitted whenever any time/distance threshold has
been exceeded.
<!-- impl GestureClick::fn connect_unpaired_release -->
This signal is emitted whenever the gesture receives a release
event that had no previous corresponding press. Due to implicit
grabs, this can only happen on situations where input is grabbed
elsewhere mid-press or the pressed widget voluntarily relinquishes
its implicit grab.
## `x`
X coordinate of the event
## `y`
Y coordinate of the event
## `button`
Button being released
## `sequence`
Sequence being released
<!-- struct GestureDrag -->

<!-- struct GesturePan -->
`GesturePan` is a `Gesture` implementation able to recognize
pan gestures, those are drags that are locked to happen along one
axis. The axis that a `GesturePan` handles is defined at
construct time, and can be changed through
`GesturePan::set_orientation`.

When the gesture starts to be recognized, `GesturePan` will
attempt to determine as early as possible whether the sequence
is moving in the expected direction, and denying the sequence if
this does not happen.

Once a panning gesture along the expected axis is recognized,
the `GesturePan::pan` signal will be emitted as input events
are received, containing the offset in the given axis.

<!-- struct GestureSingle -->
`GestureSingle` is a subclass of `Gesture`, optimized (although
not restricted) for dealing with mouse and single-touch gestures. Under
interaction, these gestures stick to the first interacting sequence, which
is accessible through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_sequence` while the
gesture is being interacted with.

By default gestures react to both `GDK_BUTTON_PRIMARY` and touch
events, `GestureSingleExt::set_touch_only` can be used to change the
touch behavior. Callers may also specify a different mouse button number
to interact with through `GestureSingleExt::set_button`, or react to any
mouse button by setting 0. While the gesture is active, the button being
currently pressed can be known through `GestureSingleExt::get_current_button`.

Touch events implicitly match with button 1.
## `button`
button number to listen to, or 0 for any button
<!-- trait GestureSingleExt::fn set_exclusive -->
Sets whether `self` is exclusive. An exclusive gesture will

<!-- struct Grid -->
`Grid` is a container which arranges its child widgets in
rows and columns, with arbitrary positions and horizontal/vertical spans.

Children are added using `GridExt::attach`. They can span multiple
rows or columns. It is also possible to add a child next to an
existing child, using `GridExt::attach_next_to`. To remove a child
from the grid, use `GridExt::remove`. The behaviour of `Grid` when
several children occupy the same grid cell is undefined.

<!-- struct GridLayout -->
`GridLayout` is a layout manager which arranges child widgets in
rows and columns, with arbitrary positions and horizontal/vertical
spans.

Children have an "attach point" defined by the horizontal and vertical
index of the cell they occupy; children can span multiple rows or columns.
The layout properties for setting the attach points and spans are set
using the `GridLayoutChild` associated to each child widget.

The behaviour of `Grid` when several children occupy the same grid cell
is undefined.

`GridLayout` can be used like a `BoxLayout` if all children are attached
to the same row or column; however, if you only ever need a single row or
column, you should consider using `BoxLayout`.

<!-- struct GridView -->
`GridView` is a widget to present a view into a large dynamic grid of items.

`GridView` uses its factory to generate one child widget for each visible item
and shows them in a grid. The orientation of the grid view determines if the
grid reflows vertically or horizontally.

`GridView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
`GridView:enable-rubberband`.

To learn more about the list widget framework, see the [overview](`ListWidget`).

# CSS nodes


```plain
gridview
├── child
│
├── child
│
┊
╰── [rubberband]
```

`GridView` uses a single CSS node with name gridview. Each child
uses a single CSS node with name child. For rubberband selection,
a subnode with name rubberband is used.

# Accessibility

`GridView` uses the `AccessibleRole::Grid` role, and the items
use the `AccessibleRole::GridCell` role.

<!-- struct HeaderBar -->
`HeaderBar` is similar to a horizontal `Box`. It allows children to
be placed at the start or the end. In addition, it allows the window
title to be displayed. The title will be centered with respect to the
width of the box, even if the children at either side take up different
amounts of space.

`HeaderBar` can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize,
maximize and close buttons, or the window icon.

For these reasons, `HeaderBar` is the natural choice for use as the custom
titlebar widget of a `Window` (see `GtkWindowExt::set_titlebar`), as it gives
features typical of titlebars while allowing the addition of child widgets.

The `HeaderBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
adding children at the start or end sides by specifying “start” or “end” as
the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element, or setting the title widget by
specifying “title” value.

By default the `HeaderBar` uses a `Label` displaying the title of the
window it is contained in as the title widget, equivalent to the following
UI definition:


```plain
headerbar
╰── windowhandle
    ╰── box
        ├── box.start
        │   ├── windowcontrols.start
        │   ╰── [other children]
        ├── [Title Widget]
        ╰── box.end
            ├── [other children]
            ╰── windowcontrols.end
```

A `HeaderBar`'s CSS node is called `headerbar`. It contains a `windowhandle`
subnode, which contains a `box` subnode, which contains two `box` subnodes at
the start and end of the header bar, as well as a center node that represents
the title.

Each of the boxes contains a `windowcontrols` subnode, see `WindowControls`
for details, as well as other children.

# Accessibility

`HeaderBar` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.

Returns whether this header bar shows the standard window
title buttons.

# Returns

<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn pack_start -->
Adds `child` to `self`, packed with reference to the
start of the `self`.
## `child`

<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn remove -->
Removes a child from `self`, after it has been added
with `HeaderBar::pack_start`, `HeaderBar::pack_end`
or `HeaderBar::set_title_widget`.
## `child`
the child to remove
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_decoration_layout -->
Sets the decoration layout for this header bar, overriding
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting.

There can be valid reasons for overriding the setting, such
as a header bar design that does not allow for buttons to take
room on the right, or only offers room for a single close button.
Split header bars are another example for overriding the
setting.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close and icon (the window icon).

For example, “icon:minimize,maximize,close” specifies a icon
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.
## `layout`
a decoration layout, or `None` to
 unset the layout
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_show_title_buttons -->
Sets whether this header bar shows the standard window
title buttons including close, maximize, and minimize.
## `setting`
`true` to show standard title buttons
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_title_widget -->
Sets the title for the `HeaderBar`.

When set to `None`, the headerbar will display the title of the window it is
contained in.

The title should help a user identify the current view. To achieve the same
style as the builtin title, use the “title” style class.

You should set the title widget to `None`, for the window title label to be
visible again.
## `title_widget`
a widget to use for a title
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn get_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for buttons. If this property is
not set, the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting
is used.

See `HeaderBar::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for buttons. If this property is
not set, the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting
is used.

See `HeaderBar::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn get_property_show_title_buttons -->
Whether to show title buttons like close, minimize, maximize.

Which buttons are actually shown and where is determined
by the `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property, and by
the state of the window (e.g. a close button will not be
shown if the window can't be closed).
<!-- impl HeaderBar::fn set_property_show_title_buttons -->
Whether to show title buttons like close, minimize, maximize.

Which buttons are actually shown and where is determined
by the `HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property, and by
the state of the window (e.g. a close button will not be
shown if the window can't be closed).
<!-- struct IMContext -->
`IMContext` defines the interface for GTK input methods. An input method
is used by GTK text input widgets like `Entry` to map from key events to
Unicode character strings.

The default input method can be set programmatically via the
`Settings:gtk-im-module` `Settings` property. Alternatively, you may set
the GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable as documented in
[Running GTK Applications][gtk-running].

The `Entry` `Entry:im-module` and `TextView` `TextView:im-module`
properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget
instances. For instance, a certain entry widget might be expected to contain
certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain input
method.

An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally
output the composed result. This is called preediting, and an input method
may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
composition states as preedit text. For instance, the default GTK input
method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down
the Control and Shift keys and then typing “U” followed by the hexadecimal
digits of the code point. When releasing the Control and Shift keys,
preediting ends and the character is inserted as text. Ctrl+Shift+u20AC for
example results in the € sign.

Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as
loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
implements a subclass of `IMContext` or `IMContextSimple` and exports
these four functions:


```C
void im_module_init(GTypeModule *module);
```
This function should register the `glib::Type` of the `IMContext` subclass which
implements the input method by means of `gobject::TypeModule::register_type`. Note
that `g_type_register_static` cannot be used as the type needs to be
registered dynamically.


```C
void im_module_exit(void);
```
Here goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module unload.


```C
void im_module_list(const GtkIMContextInfo ***contexts, int *n_contexts)
{
  *contexts = info_list;
  *n_contexts = G_N_ELEMENTS (info_list);
}
```
This function returns the list of input methods provided by the module. The
example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns a
pointer to statically defined array of ``GtkIMContextInfo`` items for each
provided input method.


```C
GtkIMContext * im_module_create(const char *context_id);
```
This function should return a pointer to a newly created instance of the
`IMContext` subclass identified by `context_id`. The context ID is the same
as specified in the ``GtkIMContextInfo`` array returned by `im_module_list`.

After a new loadable input method module has been installed on the system,
the configuration file `gtk.immodules` needs to be
regenerated by [gtk-query-immodules-3.0][gtk-query-immodules-3.0],
in order for the new input method to become available to GTK applications.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

[`IMContextExt`](trait.IMContextExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`IMContextExtManual`](prelude/trait.IMContextExtManual.html)
<!-- trait IMContextExt -->

<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn delete_surrounding -->
Asks the widget that the input context is attached to delete
characters around the cursor position by emitting the
`IMContext`::delete_surrounding signal. Note that `offset` and `n_chars`
are in characters not in bytes which differs from the usage other
places in `IMContext`.

In order to use this function, you should first call
`IMContextExt::get_surrounding` to get the current context, and
call this function immediately afterwards to make sure that you
know what you are deleting. You should also account for the fact
that even if the signal was handled, the input context might not
have deleted all the characters that were requested to be deleted.

This function is used by an input method that wants to make
subsitutions in the existing text in response to new input. It is
not useful for applications.
## `offset`
offset from cursor position in chars;
 a negative value means start before the cursor.
## `n_chars`
number of characters to delete.

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn filter_key -->
Allow an input method to forward key press and release events
to another input method, without necessarily having a `gdk::Event`
available.
## `press`
whether to forward a key press or release event
## `surface`
the surface the event is for
## `device`
the device that the event is for
## `time`
the timestamp for the event
## `keycode`
the keycode for the event
## `state`
modifier state for the event
## `group`
the active keyboard group for the event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn filter_keypress -->
Allow an input method to internally handle key press and release
events. If this function returns `true`, then no further processing
should be done for this key event.
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn focus_in -->
Notify the input method that the widget to which this
input context corresponds has gained focus. The input method
may, for example, change the displayed feedback to reflect
this change.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn focus_out -->
Notify the input method that the widget to which this
input context corresponds has lost focus. The input method
may, for example, change the displayed feedback or reset the contexts
state to reflect this change.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn get_preedit_string -->
Retrieve the current preedit string for the input context,
and a list of attributes to apply to the string.
This string should be displayed inserted at the insertion
point.
## `str`
location to store the retrieved
 string. The string retrieved must be freed with `g_free`.
## `attrs`
location to store the retrieved
 attribute list. When you are done with this list, you
 must unreference it with `pango::AttrList::unref`.
## `cursor_pos`
location to store position of cursor (in characters)
 within the preedit string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn get_surrounding -->
Retrieves context around the insertion point. Input methods
typically want context in order to constrain input text based on
existing text; this is important for languages such as Thai where
only some sequences of characters are allowed.

This function is implemented by emitting the
`IMContext`::retrieve_surrounding signal on the input method; in
response to this signal, a widget should provide as much context as
is available, up to an entire paragraph, by calling
`IMContextExt::set_surrounding`. Note that there is no obligation
for a widget to respond to the ::retrieve_surrounding signal, so input
methods must be prepared to function without context.
## `text`
location to store a UTF-8 encoded
 string of text holding context around the insertion point.
 If the function returns `true`, then you must free the result
 stored in this location with `g_free`.
## `cursor_index`
location to store byte index of the insertion
 cursor within `text`.

# Returns

`true` if surrounding text was provided; in this case
 you must free the result stored in *text.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn reset -->
Notify the input method that a change such as a change in cursor
position has been made. This will typically cause the input
method to clear the preedit state.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_client_widget -->
Set the client window for the input context; this is the
`Widget` holding the input focus. This widget is
used in order to correctly position status windows, and may
also be used for purposes internal to the input method.
## `widget`
the client widget. This may be `None` to indicate
 that the previous client widget no longer exists.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_cursor_location -->
Notify the input method that a change in cursor
position has been made. The location is relative to the client
window.
## `area`
new location
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_surrounding -->
Sets surrounding context around the insertion point and preedit
string. This function is expected to be called in response to the
`IMContext`::retrieve_surrounding signal, and will likely have no
effect if called at other times.
## `text`
text surrounding the insertion point, as UTF-8.
 the preedit string should not be included within
 `text`.
## `len`
the length of `text`, or -1 if `text` is nul-terminated
## `cursor_index`
the byte index of the insertion cursor within `text`.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn set_use_preedit -->
Sets whether the IM context should use the preedit string
to display feedback. If `use_preedit` is FALSE (default
is TRUE), then the IM context may use some other method to display
feedback, such as displaying it in a child of the root window.
## `use_preedit`
whether the IM context should use the preedit string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_commit -->
The ::commit signal is emitted when a complete input sequence
has been entered by the user. This can be a single character
immediately after a key press or the final result of preediting.
## `str`
the completed character(s) entered by the user
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_delete_surrounding -->
The ::delete-surrounding signal is emitted when the input method
needs to delete all or part of the context surrounding the cursor.
## `offset`
the character offset from the cursor position of the text
 to be deleted. A negative value indicates a position before
 the cursor.
## `n_chars`
the number of characters to be deleted

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_changed -->
The ::preedit-changed signal is emitted whenever the preedit sequence
currently being entered has changed. It is also emitted at the end of
a preedit sequence, in which case
`IMContextExt::get_preedit_string` returns the empty string.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_end -->
The ::preedit-end signal is emitted when a preediting sequence
has been completed or canceled.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_preedit_start -->
The ::preedit-start signal is emitted when a new preediting sequence
starts.
<!-- trait IMContextExt::fn connect_retrieve_surrounding -->
The ::retrieve-surrounding signal is emitted when the input method
requires the context surrounding the cursor. The callback should set
the input method surrounding context by calling the
`IMContextExt::set_surrounding` method.

# Returns

`true` if the signal was handled.
<!-- struct IMContextSimple -->
`IMContextSimple` is a simple input method context supporting table-based
input methods. It has a built-in table of compose sequences that is derived
from the X11 Compose files.

`IMContextSimple` reads additional compose sequences from the first of the
following files that is found: ~/.config/gtk-4.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose,
/usr/share/X11/locale/$locale/Compose (for locales that have a nontrivial
Compose file). The syntax of these files is described in the Compose(5)
manual page.

## Unicode characters

`IMContextSimple` also supports numeric entry of Unicode characters
by typing Ctrl-Shift-u, followed by a hexadecimal Unicode codepoint.
For example, Ctrl-Shift-u 1 2 3 Enter yields U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER
G WITH CEDILLA, i.e. ģ.

<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn new -->
Creates a new `IMContextSimple`.

# Returns

a new `IMContextSimple`.
<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn add_compose_file -->
Adds an additional table from the X11 compose file.
## `compose_file`
The path of compose file
<!-- impl IMContextSimple::fn add_table -->
Adds an additional table to search to the input context.
Each row of the table consists of `max_seq_len` key symbols
followed by two `guint16` interpreted as the high and low
words of a `gunicode` value. Tables are searched starting
from the last added.

The table must be sorted in dictionary order on the
numeric value of the key symbol fields. (Values beyond
the length of the sequence should be zero.)
## `data`
the table
## `max_seq_len`
Maximum length of a sequence in the table
 (cannot be greater than `GTK_MAX_COMPOSE_LEN`)
## `n_seqs`
number of sequences in the table

<!-- impl IMMulticontext::fn new -->
Creates a new `IMMulticontext`.

# Returns

a new `IMMulticontext`.
<!-- trait IMMulticontextExt::fn get_context_id -->
Gets the id of the currently active delegate of the `self`.

# Returns

the id of the currently active delegate
<!-- trait IMMulticontextExt::fn set_context_id -->
Sets the context id for `self`.

This causes the currently active delegate of `self` to be
replaced by the delegate corresponding to the new context id.
## `context_id`
the id to use
<!-- struct IconLookupFlags -->

<!-- struct IconPaintable -->
Contains information found when looking up an icon in
an icon theme and supports painting it as a `gdk::Paintable`.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gdk::PaintableExt`](../gdk/trait.PaintableExt.html)
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn new_for_file -->
Creates a `IconPaintable` for a file with a given size and scale
`IconPaintable`. The icon can then be rendered by using it as a `gdk::Paintable`.
## `file`
a `gio::File`
## `size`
desired icon size
## `scale`
the desired scale

# Returns

a `IconPaintable` containing
 for the icon. Unref with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn get_file -->
Gets the `gio::File` that was used to load the icon, or `None` if the icon was
not loaded from a file.

# Returns

the `gio::File` for the icon, or `None`.
 Free with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`.
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn get_icon_name -->
Get the icon name being used for this icon.

When an icon looked up in the icon theme was not available, the
icon theme may use fallback icons - either those specified to
`IconTheme::lookup_icon` or the always-available
"image-missing". The icon chosen is returned by this function.

If the icon was created without an icon theme, this function returns `None`.

# Returns

the themed icon-name for the icon, or `None`
 if its not a themed icon.
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn is_symbolic -->
Checks if the icon is symbolic or not. This currently uses only
the file name and not the file contents for determining this.
This behaviour may change in the future.

Note that to render a symbolic `IconPaintable` properly (with
recoloring), you have to set its icon name on a `Image`.

# Returns

`true` if the icon is symbolic, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn get_property_file -->
The file representing the icon, if any.
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn set_property_file -->
The file representing the icon, if any.
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn get_property_icon_name -->

Whether the icon is symbolic or not.
<!-- impl IconPaintable::fn set_property_is_symbolic -->
Whether the icon is symbolic or not.
<!-- enum IconSize -->
Built-in icon sizes.

Icon sizes default to being inherited. Where they cannot be
inherited, text size is the default.

All widgets which use `IconSize` set the normal-icons or large-icons
style classes correspondingly, and let themes determine the actual size
to be used with the -gtk-icon-size CSS property.
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Inherit -->
Keep the size of the parent element
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Normal -->
Size similar to text size
<!-- enum IconSize::variant Large -->
Large size, for example in an icon view
<!-- struct IconTheme -->
`IconTheme` provides a facility for looking up icons by name
and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
depending on what “icon theme” is selected
by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
as operating system vendors and users choose.

In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via `Image`
rather than directly, but looking up icons
directly is also simple. The `IconTheme` object acts
as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
can create new `IconTheme` objects, but it’s much more
efficient to use the standard icon theme of the `Widget`
so that the icon information is shared with other people
looking up icons.

```C
GtkIconTheme *icon_theme;
GtkIconPaintable *icon;
GdkPaintable *paintable;

icon_theme = gtk_icon_theme_get_for_display (gtk_widget_get_display (my_widget));
icon = gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon (icon_theme,
                                   "my-icon-name", // icon name
                                   48, // icon size
                                   1,  // scale
                                   0,  // flags);
 paintable = GDK_PAINTABLE (icon);
 // Use the paintable
 g_object_unref (icon);
```

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn new -->
Creates a new icon theme object. Icon theme objects are used
to lookup up an icon by name in a particular icon theme.
Usually, you’ll want to use `IconTheme::get_for_display`
rather than creating a new icon theme object for scratch.

# Returns

the newly created `IconTheme` object.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_for_display -->
Gets the icon theme object associated with `display`; if this
function has not previously been called for the given
display, a new icon theme object will be created and
associated with the display. Icon theme objects are
fairly expensive to create, so using this function
is usually a better choice than calling than `IconTheme::new`
and setting the display yourself; by using this function
a single icon theme object will be shared between users.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`

# Returns

A unique `IconTheme` associated with
 the given display. This icon theme is associated with
 the display and can be used as long as the display
 is open. Do not ref or unref it.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn add_resource_path -->
Adds a resource path that will be looked at when looking
for icons, similar to search paths.

See `IconTheme::set_resource_path`.

This function should be used to make application-specific icons
available as part of the icon theme.
## `path`
a resource path
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn add_search_path -->
Appends a directory to the search path.
See `IconTheme::set_search_path`.
## `path`
directory name to append to the icon path
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_display -->
Returns the display that the `IconTheme` object was
created for.

# Returns

the display of `icon_theme`
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_icon_names -->
Lists the names of icons in the current icon theme.

# Returns

a string array
 holding the names of all the icons in the theme. You must
 free the array using `g_strfreev`.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_icon_sizes -->
Returns an array of integers describing the sizes at which
the icon is available without scaling. A size of -1 means
that the icon is available in a scalable format. The array
is zero-terminated.
## `icon_name`
the name of an icon

# Returns

A newly
allocated array describing the sizes at which the icon is
available. The array should be freed with `g_free` when it is no
longer needed.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_resource_path -->
Gets the current resource path.

See `IconTheme::set_resource_path`.

# Returns


 A list of resource paths or `None`.
 The returned value should be freed with `g_strfreev`.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_search_path -->
Gets the current search path. See `IconTheme::set_search_path`.

# Returns


 a list of icon theme path directories or `None`.
 The returned value should be freed with `g_strfreev`.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_theme_name -->
Gets the current icon theme name.

Returns (transfer full): the current icon theme name,
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn has_icon -->
Checks whether an icon theme includes an icon
for a particular name.
## `icon_name`
the name of an icon

# Returns

`true` if `self` includes an
 icon for `icon_name`.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn lookup_by_gicon -->
Looks up a icon for a desired size and window scale, returning a
`IconPaintable`. The icon can then be rendered by using it as a `gdk::Paintable`,
or you can get information such as the filename and size.
## `icon`
the `gio::Icon` to look up
## `size`
desired icon size
## `scale`
the desired scale
## `direction`
text direction the icon will be displayed in
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconPaintable` containing
 information about the icon. Unref with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn lookup_icon -->
Looks up a named icon for a desired size and window scale, returning a
`IconPaintable`. The icon can then be rendered by using it as a `gdk::Paintable`,
or you can get information such as the filename and size.

If the available `icon_name` is not available and `fallbacks` are provided,
they will be tried in order.

If no matching icon is found, then a paintable that renders the
"missing icon" icon is returned. If you need to do something else
for missing icons you need to use `IconTheme::has_icon`.

Note that you probably want to listen for icon theme changes and
update the icon. This is usually done by overriding the
`WidgetClass.css-changed`() function.
## `icon_name`
the name of the icon to lookup
## `size`
desired icon size.
## `scale`
the window scale this will be displayed on
## `direction`
text direction the icon will be displayed in
## `flags`
flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup

# Returns

a `IconPaintable` object
 containing the icon.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_resource_path -->
Sets the resource paths that will be looked at when
looking for icons, similar to search paths.

The resources are considered as part of the hicolor icon theme
and must be located in subdirectories that are defined in the
hicolor icon theme, such as `@path/16x16/actions/run.png`
or `@path/scalable/actions/run.svg`.

Icons that are directly placed in the resource path instead
of a subdirectory are also considered as ultimate fallback,
but they are treated like unthemed icons.
## `path`
NULL-terminated array of resource paths
 that are searched for icons
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_search_path -->
Sets the search path for the icon theme object. When looking
for an icon theme, GTK will search for a subdirectory of
one or more of the directories in `path` with the same name
as the icon theme containing an index.theme file. (Themes from
multiple of the path elements are combined to allow themes to be
extended by adding icons in the user’s home directory.)

In addition if an icon found isn’t found either in the current
icon theme or the default icon theme, and an image file with
the right name is found directly in one of the elements of
`path`, then that image will be used for the icon name.
(This is legacy feature, and new icons should be put
into the fallback icon theme, which is called hicolor,
rather than directly on the icon path.)
## `path`
NULL-terminated
 array of directories that are searched for icon themes
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_theme_name -->
Sets the name of the icon theme that the `IconTheme` object uses
overriding system configuration. This function cannot be called
on the icon theme objects returned from `IconTheme::get_for_display`.

name of icon theme to use instead of
 configured theme, or `None` to unset a previously set custom theme
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted when the current icon theme is switched or GTK detects
that a change has occurred in the contents of the current
icon theme.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_property_display -->
The display that this icon theme object is attached to.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_property_display -->
The display that this icon theme object is attached to.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_property_icon_names -->
The icon names that are supported by the icon theme.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_property_resource_path -->
Resource paths that will be looked at when looking for icons,
similar to search paths.

The resources are considered as part of the hicolor icon theme
and must be located in subdirectories that are defined in the
hicolor icon theme, such as `@path/16x16/actions/run.png`.
Icons that are directly placed in the resource path instead
of a subdirectory are also considered as ultimate fallback.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_property_resource_path -->
Resource paths that will be looked at when looking for icons,
similar to search paths.

The resources are considered as part of the hicolor icon theme
and must be located in subdirectories that are defined in the
hicolor icon theme, such as `@path/16x16/actions/run.png`.
Icons that are directly placed in the resource path instead
of a subdirectory are also considered as ultimate fallback.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_property_search_path -->
The search path for this icon theme.

When looking for icons, GTK will search for a subdirectory of
one or more of the directories in the search path with the same
name as the icon theme containing an index.theme file. (Themes
from multiple of the path elements are combined to allow themes
to be extended by adding icons in the user’s home directory.)
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_property_search_path -->
The search path for this icon theme.

When looking for icons, GTK will search for a subdirectory of
one or more of the directories in the search path with the same
name as the icon theme containing an index.theme file. (Themes
from multiple of the path elements are combined to allow themes
to be extended by adding icons in the user’s home directory.)
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn get_property_theme_name -->
The name of the icon theme that is being used.

Unless set to a different value, this will be the value of
the `Settings:gtk-icon-theme-name` property of the `Settings`
object associated to the display of the icontheme object.
<!-- impl IconTheme::fn set_property_theme_name -->
The name of the icon theme that is being used.

Unless set to a different value, this will be the value of
the `Settings:gtk-icon-theme-name` property of the `Settings`
object associated to the display of the icontheme object.
<!-- enum IconThemeError -->
Error codes for `IconTheme` operations.
<!-- enum IconThemeError::variant NotFound -->
The icon specified does not exist in the theme
<!-- enum IconThemeError::variant Failed -->
An unspecified error occurred.
<!-- struct IconView -->
`IconView` provides an alternative view on a `TreeModel`.
It displays the model as a grid of icons with labels. Like
`TreeView`, it allows to select one or multiple items
(depending on the selection mode, see `IconView::set_selection_mode`).
In addition to selection with the arrow keys, `IconView` supports
rubberband selection, which is controlled by dragging the pointer.

Note that if the tree model is backed by an actual tree store (as
opposed to a flat list where the mapping to icons is obvious),
`IconView` will only display the first level of the tree and
ignore the tree’s branches.

# CSS nodes


```plain
iconview.view
╰── [rubberband]
```

`IconView` has a single CSS node with name iconview and style class .view.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

signal handler for `IconView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is an icon view item at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the item returned will be the cursor item. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model.
## `x`
the x coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `y`
the y coordinate (relative to widget coordinates)
## `keyboard_tip`
whether this is a keyboard tooltip or not
## `model`
a pointer to receive a
 `TreeModel` or `None`
## `path`
a pointer to receive a `TreePath` or `None`
## `iter`
a pointer to receive a `TreeIter` or `None`

# Returns

whether or not the given tooltip context points to an item
<!-- impl IconView::fn get_visible_range -->
Sets `start_path` and `end_path` to be the first and last visible path.
Note that there may be invisible paths in between.

Both paths should be freed with `TreePath::free` after use.
## `start_path`
Return location for start of region,
 or `None`
## `end_path`
Return location for end of region, or `None`

# Returns

`true`, if valid paths were placed in `start_path` and `end_path`
<!-- impl IconView::fn item_activated -->
Activates the item determined by `path`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be activated
<!-- impl IconView::fn path_is_selected -->
Returns `true` if the icon pointed to by `path` is currently
selected. If `path` does not point to a valid location, `false` is returned.
## `path`
A `TreePath` to check selection on.

# Returns

`true` if `path` is selected.
<!-- impl IconView::fn scroll_to_path -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `path`.
`row_align` determines where the row is placed, and `col_align` determines
where `column` is placed. Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means
center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.
This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on
the model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the
centered path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the item to move to.
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments, or `false`.
## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the item specified by `path`.
## `col_align`

<!-- impl IconView::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected icon. Note that the model or
selection cannot be modified from within this function.
## `func`

## `data`
User data to pass to the function.
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->
Causes the `IconView::item-activated` signal to be emitted on
a single click instead of a double click.
## `single`

<!-- impl IconView::fn set_column_spacing -->
Sets the ::column-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the columns of the icon view.
## `column_spacing`
the column spacing
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_columns -->
Sets the ::columns property which determines in how
many columns the icons are arranged. If `columns` is
-1, the number of columns will be chosen automatically
to fill the available area.
## `columns`
the number of columns
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular item.
If `cell` is not `None`, then focus is given to the cell specified by
it. Additionally, if `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be
started in the specified cell.

This function is often followed by `gtk_widget_grab_focus
(icon_view)` in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.
Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `cell`
One of the cell renderers of `self`, or `None`

to use for each item. If it is set to -1, the icon view will
automatically determine a suitable item size.
## `item_width`
the width for each item
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_margin -->
Sets the ::margin property which specifies the space
which is inserted at the top, bottom, left and right
of the icon view.
## `margin`
the margin
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_markup_column -->
Sets the column with markup information for `self` to be
`column`. The markup column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.

the text column set by `IconView::set_text_column`.
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `IconView`.
If the `self` already has a model set, it will remove
it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`, then
it will unset the old model.

<!-- impl IconView::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models that
support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the `TreeDragDestIface`. Both
`TreeStore` and `ListStore` support these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then
the user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows. The
developer can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's
row_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting up
the icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag and
drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the list of items can be reordered.
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_row_spacing -->

Sets the column with text for `self` to be `column`. The text
column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.
## `column`
A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_cell -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area which `cell` occupies in
the item pointed to by `path`. See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.

See also `IconView::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.

## `path`
a `TreePath`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full items, you
can use this function to have `IconView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- impl IconView::fn set_tooltip_item -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the item at `path`.

<!-- struct Image -->
The `Image` widget displays an image. Various kinds of object
can be displayed as an image; most typically, you would load a
`gdk::Texture` from a file, and then display that.
There’s a convenience function to do this, `Image::new_from_file`,
used as follows:

```C
  GtkWidget *image;
  image = gtk_image_new_from_file ("myfile.png");
```
If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a
“broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file`, then create the `Image` with
`Image::new_from_paintable`.

Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
files, such as image files. See the documentation of `gio::Resource` for details.
In this case, the `Image:resource`, `Image::new_from_resource` and
`Image::set_from_resource` should be used.

# CSS nodes

`Image` has a single CSS node with the name image. The style classes
.normal-icons or .large-icons may appear, depending on the `Image:icon-size`
property.

# Accessibility

`Image` uses the `AccessibleRole::Img` role.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl Image::fn new -->
Creates a new empty `Image` widget.

# Returns

a newly created `Image` widget.
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_file -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the file `filename`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will
display a “broken image” icon. This function never returns `None`,
it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the texture.

The storage type (`Image::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.
## `filename`
a filename

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_gicon -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be

argument. See `Image::set_icon_size` for another way to set
the icon size.
## `icon`
an icon

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_icon_name -->
Creates a `Image` displaying an icon from the current icon theme.
If the icon name isn’t known, a “broken image” icon will be
displayed instead. If the current icon theme is changed, the icon
will be updated appropriately.

# Returns

a new `Image` displaying the themed icon
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_paintable -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying `paintable`.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the

The `Image` will track changes to the `paintable` and update
its size and contents in response to it.
## `paintable`
a `gdk::Paintable`, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_pixbuf -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying `pixbuf`.
The `Image` does not assume a reference to the

`Image` will add its own reference rather than adopting yours.

This is a helper for `Image::new_from_paintable`, and you can't
get back the exact pixbuf once this is called, only a texture.

Note that this function just creates an `Image` from the pixbuf. The
`Image` created will not react to state changes. Should you want that,
you should use `Image::new_from_icon_name`.
## `pixbuf`
a `gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf`, or `None`

# Returns

a new `Image`
<!-- impl Image::fn new_from_resource -->
Creates a new `Image` displaying the resource file `resource_path`. If the file
isn’t found or can’t be loaded, the resulting `Image` will

it always returns a valid `Image` widget.

If you need to detect failures to load the file, use
`gdk_pixbuf::Pixbuf::new_from_file` to load the file yourself, then create
the `Image` from the pixbuf.

The storage type (`Image::get_storage_type`) of the returned
image is not defined, it will be whatever is appropriate for
displaying the file.

anymore, but return the GIcon directly. See `Image::get_icon_size`
for a way to get the icon size.

# Returns

a `gio::Icon`, or `None`
<!-- impl Image::fn get_icon_name -->
Gets the icon name and size being displayed by the `Image`.

The returned string is owned by the `Image` and should not
be freed.

Note: This function was changed in 3.94 not to use out parameters
anymore, but return the icon name directly. See `Image::get_icon_size`
for a way to get the icon size.

to a value != -1, it is used instead of the icon size set by
`Image::set_from_icon_name`.
## `pixel_size`
the new pixel size
<!-- impl Image::fn get_property_gicon -->
The GIcon displayed in the `Image`. For themed icons,
If the icon theme is changed, the image will be updated
automatically.
<!-- impl Image::fn set_property_gicon -->
The GIcon displayed in the `Image`. For themed icons,
If the icon theme is changed, the image will be updated
automatically.
<!-- impl Image::fn get_property_icon_name -->
The name of the icon in the icon theme. If the icon theme is
changed, the image will be updated automatically.
<!-- impl Image::fn set_property_icon_name -->
The name of the icon in the icon theme. If the icon theme is
changed, the image will be updated automatically.
<!-- impl Image::fn get_property_pixel_size -->
The "pixel-size" property can be used to specify a fixed size
overriding the `Image:icon-size` property for images of type
`ImageType::IconName`.
<!-- impl Image::fn set_property_pixel_size -->
The "pixel-size" property can be used to specify a fixed size
overriding the `Image:icon-size` property for images of type
`ImageType::IconName`.

A path to a resource file to display.
<!-- impl Image::fn set_property_resource -->
A path to a resource file to display.
<!-- impl Image::fn get_property_use_fallback -->
Whether the icon displayed in the `Image` will use
standard icon names fallback. The value of this property
is only relevant for images of type `ImageType::IconName`
and `ImageType::Gicon`.
<!-- impl Image::fn set_property_use_fallback -->
Whether the icon displayed in the `Image` will use
standard icon names fallback. The value of this property
is only relevant for images of type `ImageType::IconName`
and `ImageType::Gicon`.
<!-- enum ImageType -->
Describes the image data representation used by a `Image`. If you
want to get the image from the widget, you can only get the
currently-stored representation. e.g. if the
`Image::get_storage_type` returns `ImageType::Paintable`, then you can
call `Image::get_paintable`. For empty images, you can request any
storage type (call any of the "get" functions), but they will all
return `None` values.
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Empty -->
there is no image displayed by the widget
<!-- enum ImageType::variant IconName -->
the widget contains a named icon
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Gicon -->
the widget contains a `gio::Icon`
<!-- enum ImageType::variant Paintable -->
the widget contains a `gdk::Paintable`
<!-- struct InfoBar -->
`InfoBar` is a widget that can be used to show messages to
the user without showing a dialog. It is often temporarily shown
at the top or bottom of a document. In contrast to `Dialog`, which
has an action area at the bottom, `InfoBar` has an action area
at the side.

The API of `InfoBar` is very similar to `Dialog`, allowing you
to add buttons to the action area with `InfoBar::add_button` or
`InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. The sensitivity of action widgets
can be controlled with `InfoBar::set_response_sensitive`.

To add widgets to the main content area of a `InfoBar`, use
`InfoBar::add_child`.

Similar to `MessageDialog`, the contents of a `InfoBar` can by
classified as error message, warning, informational message, etc,
by using `InfoBar::set_message_type`. GTK may use the message type
to determine how the message is displayed.

A simple example for using a `InfoBar`:

```C
GtkWidget *message_label;
GtkWidget *widget;
GtkWidget *grid;
GtkInfoBar *bar;

// set up info bar
widget = gtk_info_bar_new ();
bar = GTK_INFO_BAR (widget);
grid = gtk_grid_new ();

message_label = gtk_label_new ("");
gtk_info_bar_add_child (bar, message_label);
gtk_info_bar_add_button (bar,
                         _("_OK"),
                         GTK_RESPONSE_OK);
g_signal_connect (bar,
                  "response",
                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_hide),
                  NULL);
gtk_grid_attach (GTK_GRID (grid),
                 widget,
                 0, 2, 1, 1);

// ...

// show an error message
gtk_label_set_text (GTK_LABEL (message_label), "An error occurred!");
gtk_info_bar_set_message_type (bar, GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR);
gtk_widget_show (bar);
```

# `InfoBar` as `Buildable`

The `InfoBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes
the content area and action area as internal children with the names
“content_area” and “action_area”.

`InfoBar` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
(which should be a child of the dialogs `action_area`).

# CSS nodes

`InfoBar` has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get
one of the style classes .info, .warning, .error or .question, depending
on the message type.
If the info bar shows a close button, that button will have the .close
style class applied.

<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` object.

# Returns

a new `InfoBar` object
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn new_with_buttons -->
Creates a new `InfoBar` with buttons. Button text/response ID
pairs should be listed, with a `None` pointer ending the list.
A response ID can be any positive number,
or one of the values in the `ResponseType` enumeration. If the
user clicks one of these dialog buttons, `InfoBar` will emit
the “response” signal with the corresponding response ID.
## `first_button_text`
ext to go in first button, or `None`

# Returns

a new `InfoBar`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_action_widget -->
Add an activatable widget to the action area of a `InfoBar`,
connecting a signal handler that will emit the `InfoBar::response`
signal on the message area when the widget is activated. The widget
is appended to the end of the message areas action area.
## `child`
an activatable widget
## `response_id`
response ID for `child`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_button -->
Adds a button with the given text and sets things up so that
clicking the button will emit the “response” signal with the given
response_id. The button is appended to the end of the info bars's
action area. The button widget is returned, but usually you don't
need it.
## `button_text`
text of button
## `response_id`
response ID for the button

# Returns

the `Button` widget
that was added
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_buttons -->
Adds more buttons, same as calling `InfoBar::add_button`
repeatedly. The variable argument list should be `None`-terminated
as with `InfoBar::new_with_buttons`. Each button must have both
text and response ID.
## `first_button_text`
button text
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn add_child -->
Adds a widget to the content area of the info bar.
## `widget`
the child to be added
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_message_type -->
Returns the message type of the message area.

# Returns

the message type of the message area.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_revealed -->
Returns whether the info bar is currently revealed.

# Returns

the current value of the `InfoBar:revealed` property
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_show_close_button -->
Returns whether the widget will display a standard close button.

# Returns

`true` if the widget displays standard close button
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn remove_action_widget -->
Removes a widget from the action area of `self`, after
it been put there by a call to `InfoBar::add_action_widget`
or `InfoBar::add_button`.
## `widget`
an action widget to remove
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn remove_child -->
Removes a widget from the content area of the info bar,
after it has been added with `InfoBar::add_child`.
## `widget`
a child that has been added to the content area
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn response -->
Emits the “response” signal with the given `response_id`.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_default_response -->
Sets the last widget in the info bar’s action area with
the given response_id as the default widget for the dialog.
Pressing “Enter” normally activates the default widget.

Note that this function currently requires `self` to
be added to a widget hierarchy.
## `response_id`
a response ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_message_type -->
Sets the message type of the message area.

GTK uses this type to determine how the message is displayed.
## `message_type`
a `MessageType`
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_response_sensitive -->
Calls gtk_widget_set_sensitive (widget, setting) for each
widget in the info bars’s action area with the given response_id.
A convenient way to sensitize/desensitize dialog buttons.
## `response_id`
a response ID
## `setting`
TRUE for sensitive
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_revealed -->
Sets the `InfoBar:revealed` property to `revealed`. Changing this will make
`self` reveal (`true`) or conceal (`false`) itself via a sliding transition.

Note: this does not show or hide `self` in the `Widget:visible` sense,
so revealing has no effect if `Widget:visible` is `false`.
## `revealed`
The new value of the property
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_show_close_button -->
If true, a standard close button is shown. When clicked it emits
the response `ResponseType::Close`.
## `setting`
`true` to include a close button
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn connect_close -->
The ::close signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user uses a keybinding to dismiss
the info bar.

The default binding for this signal is the Escape key.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when an action widget is clicked or the application programmer
calls `InfoBar::response`. The `response_id` depends on which action
widget was clicked.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_property_message_type -->
The type of the message.

The type may be used to determine the appearance of the info bar.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_property_message_type -->
The type of the message.

The type may be used to determine the appearance of the info bar.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn get_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to include a standard close button.
<!-- impl InfoBar::fn set_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to include a standard close button.
<!-- struct InputHints -->
Describes hints that might be taken into account by input methods
or applications. Note that input methods may already tailor their
behaviour according to the `InputPurpose` of the entry.

Some common sense is expected when using these flags - mixing
`InputHints::Lowercase` with any of the uppercase hints makes no sense.

This enumeration may be extended in the future; input methods should
ignore unknown values.
<!-- struct InputHints::const NONE -->
No special behaviour suggested
<!-- struct InputHints::const SPELLCHECK -->
Suggest checking for typos
<!-- struct InputHints::const NO_SPELLCHECK -->
Suggest not checking for typos
<!-- struct InputHints::const WORD_COMPLETION -->
Suggest word completion
<!-- struct InputHints::const LOWERCASE -->
Suggest to convert all text to lowercase
<!-- struct InputHints::const UPPERCASE_CHARS -->
Suggest to capitalize all text
<!-- struct InputHints::const UPPERCASE_WORDS -->

 character of each word
<!-- struct InputHints::const UPPERCASE_SENTENCES -->
Suggest to capitalize the
 first word of each sentence
<!-- struct InputHints::const INHIBIT_OSK -->

 (e.g for a calculator that already has all the keys).
<!-- struct InputHints::const VERTICAL_WRITING -->
The text is vertical
<!-- struct InputHints::const EMOJI -->
Suggest offering Emoji support
<!-- struct InputHints::const NO_EMOJI -->
Suggest not offering Emoji support
<!-- struct InputHints::const PRIVATE -->
Request that the input method should not
 update personalized data (like typing history)
<!-- enum InputPurpose -->
Describes primary purpose of the input widget. This information is
useful for on-screen keyboards and similar input methods to decide
which keys should be presented to the user.

Note that the purpose is not meant to impose a totally strict rule
about allowed characters, and does not replace input validation.
It is fine for an on-screen keyboard to let the user override the
character set restriction that is expressed by the purpose. The
application is expected to validate the entry contents, even if
it specified a purpose.

The difference between `InputPurpose::Digits` and
`InputPurpose::Number` is that the former accepts only digits
while the latter also some punctuation (like commas or points, plus,
minus) and “e” or “E” as in 3.14E+000.

This enumeration may be extended in the future; input methods should
interpret unknown values as “free form”.
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant FreeForm -->
Allow any character
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Alpha -->
Allow only alphabetic characters
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Digits -->
Allow only digits
<!-- enum InputPurpose::variant Number -->
Edited field expects numbers

<!-- enum Justification::variant Center -->
The text is placed in the center of the label.
<!-- enum Justification::variant Fill -->
The text is placed is distributed across the label.
<!-- struct KeyvalTrigger -->
A `ShortcutTrigger` that triggers when a specific keyval
and (optionally) modifiers are pressed.

# Implements

[`ShortcutTriggerExt`](trait.ShortcutTriggerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ShortcutTriggerExtManual`](prelude/trait.ShortcutTriggerExtManual.html)
<!-- impl KeyvalTrigger::fn new -->
Creates a `ShortcutTrigger` that will trigger whenever
the key with the given `keyval` and `modifiers` is pressed.
## `keyval`
The keyval to trigger for
## `modifiers`
the modifiers that need to be present

# Returns

A new `ShortcutTrigger`
<!-- impl KeyvalTrigger::fn get_keyval -->
Gets the keyval that must be pressed to succeed
triggering `self`.

# Returns

the keyval

The key modifiers for the trigger.
<!-- impl KeyvalTrigger::fn set_property_modifiers -->
The key modifiers for the trigger.
<!-- struct Label -->
The `Label` widget displays a small amount of text. As the name
implies, most labels are used to label another widget such as a `Button`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
label
├── [selection]
├── [link]
┊
╰── [link]
```

`Label` has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
.dim-label, etc. In the `ShortcutsWindow`, labels are used with the
.keycap style class.

If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.

If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
visited. In this case, label node also gets a .link style class.

# `Label` as `Buildable`

The `Label` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
“start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify `pango::Attribute` values for
this label.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:

```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_button_set_child (GTK_BUTTON (button), label);
```

There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
already inside:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
```

To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
`Entry`, you have to point the label at the entry with
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`:


```C
  // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
  GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
```

# Markup (styled text)

To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
[markup format][PangoMarkupFormat].

Here’s how to create a label with a small font:

```C
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
  gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
```

(See [complete documentation][PangoMarkupFormat] of available
tags in the Pango manual.)

The markup passed to `Label::set_markup` must be valid; for example,
literal <, > and & characters must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.
If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
`Label::set_markup`, you’ll want to escape it with
`g_markup_escape_text` or `g_markup_printf_escaped`.

Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the `pango::AttrList` on
a label; `Label::set_attributes` may be a simpler way to set
attributes in some cases. Be careful though; `pango::AttrList` tends to
cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
to [0, `G_MAXINT`)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
end_index for a `pango::Attribute` requires knowledge of the exact string
being displayed, so translations will cause problems.

# Selectable labels

Labels can be made selectable with `Label::set_selectable`.
Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information
— such as error messages — should be made selectable.

# Text layout # {`label`-text-layout}

A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
understood by Pango.

Labels can automatically wrap text if you call
`Label::set_wrap`.

`Label::set_justify` sets how the lines in a label align
with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole
aligns in its available space, see the `Widget:halign` and
`Widget:valign` properties.

The `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars` properties
can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or wrapped
labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.

Note that the interpretation of `Label:width-chars` and
`Label:max-width-chars` has changed a bit with the introduction of
[width-for-height geometry management.][geometry-management]

# Links

GTK supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition
to regular Pango markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML,
using the `<a>` with “href“, “title“ and “class“ attributes. GTK renders links
similar to the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined
text. The “title“ attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link. The “class“
attribute is used as style class on the CSS node for the link.

An example looks like this:


```C
const char *text =
"Go to the"
"<a href=\"http://www.gtk.org title=\"&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
"GTK website</a> for more...";
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
```

It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips with
the `Label::activate-link` signal and the `Label::get_current_uri` function.

<!-- impl Label::fn new -->
Creates a new label with the given text inside it. You can
pass `None` to get an empty label widget.
## `str`
The text of the label

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- impl Label::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `Label`, containing the text in `str`.

If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are
underlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use
'__' (two underscores). The first underlined character represents a
keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic. The mnemonic key can be used
to activate another widget, chosen automatically, or explicitly using
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.

If `Label::set_mnemonic_widget` is not called, then the first
activatable ancestor of the `Label` will be chosen as the mnemonic
widget. For instance, if the label is inside a button or menu item,
the button or menu item will automatically become the mnemonic widget
and be activated by the mnemonic.
## `str`
The text of the label, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

the new `Label`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_attributes -->
Gets the attribute list that was set on the label using
`Label::set_attributes`, if any. This function does
not reflect attributes that come from the labels markup
(see `Label::set_markup`). If you want to get the
effective attributes for the label, use
pango_layout_get_attribute (gtk_label_get_layout (self)).

# Returns

the attribute list, or `None`
 if none was set.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_current_uri -->
Returns the URI for the currently active link in the label.
The active link is the one under the mouse pointer or, in a
selectable label, the link in which the text cursor is currently
positioned.

This function is intended for use in a `Label::activate-link` handler
or for use in a `Widget::query-tooltip` handler.

# Returns

the currently active URI or `None` if there is none.
 The string is owned by GTK and must not be freed or modified.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_ellipsize -->
Returns the ellipsizing position of the label. See `Label::set_ellipsize`.

# Returns

`Justification`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_label -->
Fetches the text from a label widget including any embedded
underlines indicating mnemonics and Pango markup. (See
`Label::get_text`).

# Returns

the text of the label widget. This string is
 owned by the widget and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the label.
The layout is useful to e.g. convert text positions to
pixel positions, in combination with `Label::get_layout_offsets`.
The returned layout is owned by the `label` so need not be
freed by the caller. The `label` is free to recreate its layout at
any time, so it should be considered read-only.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this label
<!-- impl Label::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the label will draw the `pango::Layout`
representing the text in the label; useful to convert mouse events
into coordinates inside the `pango::Layout`, e.g. to take some action
if some part of the label is clicked. Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` functions you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_lines -->
Gets the number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping
label should be limited. See `Label::set_lines`.

# Returns

The number of lines
<!-- impl Label::fn get_max_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired maximum width of `label`, in characters. See
`Label::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the maximum width of the label in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_mnemonic_keyval -->
If the label has been set so that it has a mnemonic key this function
returns the keyval used for the mnemonic accelerator. If there is no
mnemonic set up it returns `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`.

# Returns

GDK keyval usable for accelerators, or `GDK_KEY_VoidSymbol`
<!-- impl Label::fn get_mnemonic_widget -->
Retrieves the target of the mnemonic (keyboard shortcut) of this
label. See `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.

# Returns

the target of the label’s mnemonic,
 or `None` if none has been set and the default algorithm will be used.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value set by `Label::set_selectable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can copy text from the label
<!-- impl Label::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Gets the selected range of characters in the label, returning `true`
if there’s a selection.
## `start`
return location for start of selection, as a character offset
## `end`
return location for end of selection, as a character offset

# Returns

`true` if selection is non-empty
<!-- impl Label::fn get_single_line_mode -->
Returns whether the label is in single line mode.

# Returns

`true` when the label is in single line mode.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_text -->
Fetches the text from a label widget, as displayed on the
screen. This does not include any embedded underlines
indicating mnemonics or Pango markup. (See `Label::get_label`)

# Returns

the text in the label widget. This is the internal
 string used by the label, and must not be modified.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_use_markup -->
Returns whether the label’s text is interpreted as marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See gtk_label_set_use_markup ().

# Returns

`true` if the label’s text will be parsed for markup.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_use_underline -->

mnemonic. See `Label::set_use_underline`.

# Returns

`true` whether an embedded underline in the label indicates
 the mnemonic accelerator keys.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_width_chars -->
Retrieves the desired width of `label`, in characters. See
`Label::set_width_chars`.

# Returns

the width of the label in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_wrap -->
Returns whether lines in the label are automatically wrapped.
See `Label::set_wrap`.

# Returns

`true` if the lines of the label are automatically wrapped.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_wrap_mode -->
Returns line wrap mode used by the label. See `Label::set_wrap_mode`.

# Returns

`true` if the lines of the label are automatically wrapped.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_xalign -->
Gets the `Label:xalign` property for `label`.

# Returns

the xalign property
<!-- impl Label::fn get_yalign -->
Gets the `Label:yalign` property for `label`.

# Returns

the yalign property
<!-- impl Label::fn select_region -->
Selects a range of characters in the label, if the label is selectable.
See `Label::set_selectable`. If the label is not selectable,
this function has no effect. If `start_offset` or
`end_offset` are -1, then the end of the label will be substituted.
## `start_offset`
start offset (in characters not bytes)
## `end_offset`
end offset (in characters not bytes)
<!-- impl Label::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
label text.

The attributes set with this function will be applied
and merged with any other attributes previously effected by way
of the `Label:use-underline` or `Label:use-markup` properties.
While it is not recommended to mix markup strings with manually set
attributes, if you must; know that the attributes will be applied
to the label after the markup string is parsed.
## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList`, or `None`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") to the text
if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_extra_menu -->
Sets a menu model to add when constructing
the context menu for `label`.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_justify -->
Sets the alignment of the lines in the text of the label relative to
each other. `Justification::Left` is the default value when the widget is
first created with `Label::new`. If you instead want to set the
alignment of the label as a whole, use `WidgetExt::set_halign` instead.
`Label::set_justify` has no effect on labels containing only a
single line.
## `jtype`
a `Justification`
<!-- impl Label::fn set_label -->
Sets the text of the label. The label is interpreted as
including embedded underlines and/or Pango markup depending
on the values of the `Label:use-underline` and
`Label:use-markup` properties.
## `str`
the new text to set for the label
<!-- impl Label::fn set_lines -->
Sets the number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited. This has no effect if the label is not wrapping
or ellipsized. Set this to -1 if you don’t want to limit the
number of lines.
## `lines`
the desired number of lines, or -1
<!-- impl Label::fn set_markup -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat], setting the
label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results.

If the `str` is external data, you may need to escape it with
`g_markup_escape_text` or `g_markup_printf_escaped`:


```C
GtkWidget *self = gtk_label_new (NULL);
const char *str = "...";
const char *format = "<span style=\"italic\">\%s</span>";
char *markup;

markup = g_markup_printf_escaped (format, str);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (self), markup);
g_free (markup);
```

This function will set the `Label:use-markup` property to `true` as
a side effect.

If you set the label contents using the `Label:label` property you
should also ensure that you set the `Label:use-markup` property
accordingly.

See also: `Label::set_text`
## `str`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- impl Label::fn set_markup_with_mnemonic -->
Parses `str` which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat],
setting the label’s text and attribute list based on the parse results.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.

The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a markup string (see
 [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- impl Label::fn set_max_width_chars -->
Sets the desired maximum width in characters of `label` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired maximum width, in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_mnemonic_widget -->
If the label has been set so that it has a mnemonic key (using
i.e. `Label::set_markup_with_mnemonic`,
`Label::set_text_with_mnemonic`, `Label::new_with_mnemonic`
or the “use_underline” property) the label can be associated with a
widget that is the target of the mnemonic. When the label is inside
a widget (like a `Button` or a `Notebook` tab) it is
automatically associated with the correct widget, but sometimes
(i.e. when the target is a `Entry` next to the label) you need to
set it explicitly using this function.

The target widget will be accelerated by emitting the
`Widget`::mnemonic-activate signal on it. The default handler for
this signal will activate the widget if there are no mnemonic collisions
and toggle focus between the colliding widgets otherwise.
## `widget`
the target `Widget`, or `None` to unset
<!-- impl Label::fn set_selectable -->
Selectable labels allow the user to select text from the label, for
copy-and-paste.
## `setting`
`true` to allow selecting text in the label
<!-- impl Label::fn set_single_line_mode -->
Sets whether the label is in single line mode.
## `single_line_mode`
`true` if the label should be in single line mode
<!-- impl Label::fn set_text -->
Sets the text within the `Label` widget. It overwrites any text that
was there before.

This function will clear any previously set mnemonic accelerators, and
set the `Label:use-underline` property to `false` as a side effect.

This function will set the `Label:use-markup` property to `false`
as a side effect.

See also: `Label::set_markup`
## `str`
The text you want to set
<!-- impl Label::fn set_text_with_mnemonic -->
Sets the label’s text from the string `str`.
If characters in `str` are preceded by an underscore, they are underlined
indicating that they represent a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.
The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen
automatically, or explicitly using `Label::set_mnemonic_widget`.
## `str`
a string
<!-- impl Label::fn set_use_markup -->
Sets whether the text of the label contains markup in
[Pango’s text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
See `Label::set_markup`.
## `setting`
`true` if the label’s text should be parsed for markup.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_use_underline -->
If true, an underline in the text indicates the next character should be
used for the mnemonic accelerator key.
## `setting`
`true` if underlines in the text indicate mnemonics
<!-- impl Label::fn set_width_chars -->
Sets the desired width in characters of `label` to `n_chars`.
## `n_chars`
the new desired width, in characters.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_wrap -->
Toggles line wrapping within the `Label` widget. `true` makes it break
lines if text exceeds the widget’s size. `false` lets the text get cut off
by the edge of the widget if it exceeds the widget size.

Note that setting line wrapping to `true` does not make the label
wrap at its parent container’s width, because GTK widgets
conceptually can’t make their requisition depend on the parent
container’s size. For a label that wraps at a specific position,
set the label’s width using `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
## `wrap`
the setting
<!-- impl Label::fn set_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see `Label::set_wrap`) this controls how
the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word` which means
wrap on word boundaries.
## `wrap_mode`
the line wrapping mode
<!-- impl Label::fn set_xalign -->
Sets the `Label:xalign` property for `label`.
## `xalign`
the new xalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- impl Label::fn set_yalign -->
Sets the `Label:yalign` property for `label`.
## `yalign`
the new yalign value, between 0 and 1
<!-- impl Label::fn connect_activate_current_link -->
A [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user activates a link in the label.

Applications may also emit the signal with `g_signal_emit_by_name`
if they need to control activation of URIs programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal are all forms of the Enter key.
<!-- impl Label::fn connect_activate_link -->
The signal which gets emitted to activate a URI.
Applications may connect to it to override the default behaviour,
which is to call `gtk_show_uri`.
## `uri`
the URI that is activated

# Returns

`true` if the link has been activated
<!-- impl Label::fn connect_copy_clipboard -->
The ::copy-clipboard signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to copy the selection to the clipboard.

The default binding for this signal is Ctrl-c.
<!-- impl Label::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `entry`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifier does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual characters/lines
- Ctrl-arrow key combinations move by words/paragraphs
- Home/End keys move to the ends of the buffer
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a `MovementStep`
## `count`
the number of `step` units to move
## `extend_selection`
`true` if the move should extend the selection
<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the label does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the label requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis "...". In particular, this
means that ellipsizing labels do not work well in notebook tabs, unless
the `Notebook` tab-expand child property is set to `true`. Other ways
to set a label's width are `WidgetExt::set_size_request` and
`Label::set_width_chars`.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_ellipsize -->

<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_extra_menu -->
A menu model whose contents will be appended to
the context menu.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_extra_menu -->
A menu model whose contents will be appended to
the context menu.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_label -->
The contents of the label.

If the string contains [Pango XML markup][PangoMarkupFormat], you will
have to set the `Label:use-markup` property to `true` in order for the
label to display the markup attributes. See also `Label::set_markup`
for a convenience function that sets both this property and the
`Label:use-markup` property at the same time.

If the string contains underlines acting as mnemonics, you will have to
set the `Label:use-underline` property to `true` in order for the label
to display them.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_label -->
The contents of the label.

<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_max_width_chars -->
The desired maximum width of the label, in characters. If this property
is set to -1, the width will be calculated automatically.

See the section on [text layout][label-text-layout]
for details of how `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars`
determine the width of ellipsized and wrapped labels.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_max_width_chars -->
The desired maximum width of the label, in characters. If this property
is set to -1, the width will be calculated automatically.

See the section on [text layout][label-text-layout]
for details of how `Label:width-chars` and `Label:max-width-chars`
determine the width of ellipsized and wrapped labels.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_single_line_mode -->
Whether the label is in single line mode. In single line mode,
the height of the label does not depend on the actual text, it
is always set to ascent + descent of the font. This can be an
advantage in situations where resizing the label because of text
changes would be distracting, e.g. in a statusbar.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_single_line_mode -->
Whether the label is in single line mode. In single line mode,
the height of the label does not depend on the actual text, it
is always set to ascent + descent of the font. This can be an

<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see the `Label:wrap` property) this controls
how the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word`, which
means wrap on word boundaries.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_wrap_mode -->
If line wrapping is on (see the `Label:wrap` property) this controls
how the line wrapping is done. The default is `pango::WrapMode::Word`, which
means wrap on word boundaries.
<!-- impl Label::fn get_property_xalign -->

inside the labels size allocation. Compare this to `Widget:halign`,
which determines how the labels size allocation is positioned in the
space available for the label.
<!-- impl Label::fn set_property_xalign -->

inside the labels size allocation. Compare this to `Widget:valign`,
which determines how the labels size allocation is positioned in the
space available for the label.
<!-- struct LayoutChild -->
`LayoutChild` is the base class for objects that are meant to hold
layout properties. If a `LayoutManager` has per-child properties,
like their packing type, or the horizontal and vertical span, or the
icon name, then the layout manager should use a `LayoutChild`
implementation to store those properties.

A `LayoutChild` instance is only ever valid while a widget is part
of a layout.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

# Implements

<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn get_layout_manager -->
Retrieves the `LayoutManager` instance that created the

<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn set_property_child_widget -->
The widget that is associated to the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn get_property_layout_manager -->
The layout manager that created the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- trait LayoutChildExt::fn set_property_layout_manager -->
The layout manager that created the `LayoutChild` instance.
<!-- struct LayoutManager -->
Layout managers are delegate classes that handle the preferred size
and the allocation of a container widget.

You typically subclass `LayoutManager` if you want to implement a
layout policy for the children of a widget, or if you want to determine
the size of a widget depending on its contents.

Each `Widget` can only have a `LayoutManager` instance associated to it
at any given time; it is possible, though, to replace the layout manager
instance using `WidgetExt::set_layout_manager`.

## Layout properties

A layout manager can expose properties for controlling the layout of
each child, by creating an object type derived from `LayoutChild`
and installing the properties on it as normal GObject properties.

Each `LayoutChild` instance storing the layout properties for a
specific child is created through the `LayoutManagerExt::get_layout_child`
method; a `LayoutManager` controls the creation of its `LayoutChild`
instances by overriding the `LayoutManagerClass`.`create_layout_child`
virtual function. The typical implementation should look like:


```C
static GtkLayoutChild *
create_layout_child (GtkLayoutManager *manager,
                     GtkWidget        *container,
                     GtkWidget        *child)
{
  return g_object_new (your_layout_child_get_type (),
                       "layout-manager", manager,
                       "child-widget", child,
                       NULL);
}
```

The `LayoutChild:layout-manager` and `LayoutChild:child-widget` properties
on the newly created `LayoutChild` instance are mandatory. The
`LayoutManager` will cache the newly created `LayoutChild` instance until
the widget is removed from its parent, or the parent removes the layout
manager.

Each `LayoutManager` instance creating a `LayoutChild` should use
`LayoutManagerExt::get_layout_child` every time it needs to query the
layout properties; each `LayoutChild` instance should call
`LayoutManagerExt::layout_changed` every time a property is updated, in
order to queue a new size measuring and allocation.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn allocate -->
This function assigns the given `width`, `height`, and `baseline` to
a `widget`, and computes the position and sizes of the children of
the `widget` using the layout management policy of `self`.

the new height of the `widget`
## `baseline`
the baseline position of the `widget`, or -1
<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn get_layout_child -->
Retrieves a `LayoutChild` instance for the `LayoutManager`, creating
one if necessary.

The `child` widget must be a child of the widget using `self`.

The `LayoutChild` instance is owned by the `LayoutManager`, and is
guaranteed to exist as long as `child` is a child of the `Widget` using
the given `LayoutManager`.
## `child`
a `Widget`

# Returns

a `LayoutChild`
<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn get_request_mode -->
Retrieves the request mode of `self`.

# Returns

<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn layout_changed -->
Queues a resize on the `Widget` using `self`, if any.

This function should be called by subclasses of `LayoutManager` in
response to changes to their layout management policies.
<!-- trait LayoutManagerExt::fn measure -->
Measures the size of the `widget` using `self`, for the
given `orientation` and size.

See [`Widget`'s geometry management section][geometry-management] for
more details.
## `widget`
the `Widget` using `self`
## `orientation`
the orientation to measure
## `for_size`
Size for the opposite of `orientation`; for instance, if
 the `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal`, this is the height
 of the widget; if the `orientation` is `Orientation::Vertical`, this
 is the width of the widget. This allows to measure the height for the
 given width, and the width for the given height. Use -1 if the size
 is not known
## `minimum`
the minimum size for the given size and
 orientation
## `natural`
the natural, or preferred size for the
 given size and orientation
## `minimum_baseline`
the baseline position for the
 minimum size
## `natural_baseline`
the baseline position for the
 natural size
<!-- struct LevelBar -->
The `LevelBar` is a bar widget that can be used
as a level indicator. Typical use cases are displaying the strength
of a password, or showing the charge level of a battery.

Use `LevelBar::set_value` to set the current value, and
`LevelBar::add_offset_value` to set the value offsets at which
the bar will be considered in a different state. GTK will add a few
offsets by default on the level bar: `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW`,
`GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_HIGH` and `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_FULL`, with
values 0.25, 0.75 and 1.0 respectively.

Note that it is your responsibility to update preexisting offsets
when changing the minimum or maximum value. GTK will simply clamp
them to the new range.

## Adding a custom offset on the bar


```C

static GtkWidget *
create_level_bar (void)
{
  GtkWidget *widget;
  GtkLevelBar *bar;

  widget = gtk_level_bar_new ();
  bar = GTK_LEVEL_BAR (widget);

  // This changes the value of the default low offset

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar,
                                  GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
                                  0.10);

  // This adds a new offset to the bar; the application will
  // be able to change its color CSS like this:
  //
  // levelbar block.my-offset {
  //   background-color: magenta;
  //   border-style: solid;
  //   border-color: black;
  //   border-style: 1px;
  // }

  gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar, "my-offset", 0.60);

  return widget;
}
```

The default interval of values is between zero and one, but it’s possible to
modify the interval using `LevelBar::set_min_value` and
`LevelBar::set_max_value`. The value will be always drawn in proportion to
the admissible interval, i.e. a value of 15 with a specified interval between
10 and 20 is equivalent to a value of 0.5 with an interval between 0 and 1.
When `LevelBarMode::Discrete` is used, the bar level is rendered
as a finite number of separated blocks instead of a single one. The number
of blocks that will be rendered is equal to the number of units specified by
the admissible interval.

For instance, to build a bar rendered with five blocks, it’s sufficient to
set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 5 after changing the indicator
mode to discrete.

# `LevelBar` as `Buildable`

The `LevelBar` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom `<offsets>` element, which can contain any number of `<offset>` elements,
each of which must have name and value attributes.

# CSS nodes


```plain
levelbar[.discrete]
╰── trough
    ├── block.filled.level-name
    ┊
    ├── block.empty
    ┊
```

`LevelBar` has a main CSS node with name levelbar and one of the style
classes .discrete or .continuous and a subnode with name trough. Below the
trough node are a number of nodes with name block and style class .filled
or .empty. In continuous mode, there is exactly one node of each, in discrete
mode, the number of filled and unfilled nodes corresponds to blocks that are
drawn. The block.filled nodes also get a style class .level-name corresponding
to the level for the current value.

In horizontal orientation, the nodes are always arranged from left to right,
regardless of text direction.

# Accessibility

`LevelBar` uses the `AccessibleRole::Meter` role.

a value in the interval between
 `LevelBar:min-value` and `LevelBar:max-value`
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn connect_offset_changed -->
Emitted when an offset specified on the bar changes value as an
effect to `LevelBar::add_offset_value` being called.

The signal supports detailed connections; you can connect to the
detailed signal "changed::x" in order to only receive callbacks when
the value of offset "x" changes.
## `name`
the name of the offset that changed value
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn get_property_inverted -->
Level bars normally grow from top to bottom or left to right.
Inverted level bars grow in the opposite direction.
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn set_property_inverted -->
Level bars normally grow from top to bottom or left to right.
Inverted level bars grow in the opposite direction.
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn get_property_max_value -->
The `LevelBar:max-value` property determaxes the maximum value of
the interval that can be displayed by the bar.

The `LevelBar:max-value` property determaxes the maximum value of
the interval that can be displayed by the bar.
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn get_property_min_value -->
The `LevelBar:min-value` property determines the minimum value of
the interval that can be displayed by the bar.
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn set_property_min_value -->
The `LevelBar:min-value` property determines the minimum value of
the interval that can be displayed by the bar.
<!-- impl LevelBar::fn get_property_mode -->
The `LevelBar:mode` property determines the way `LevelBar`
interprets the value properties to draw the level fill area.
Specifically, when the value is `LevelBarMode::Continuous`,
`LevelBar` will draw a single block representing the current value in
that area; when the value is `LevelBarMode::Discrete`,
the widget will draw a succession of separate blocks filling the
draw area, with the number of blocks being equal to the units separating
the integral roundings of `LevelBar:min-value` and `LevelBar:max-value`.

<!-- struct LinkButton -->
A `LinkButton` is a `Button` with a hyperlink, similar to the one
used by web browsers, which triggers an action when clicked. It is useful
to show quick links to resources.

A link button is created by calling either `LinkButton::new` or
`LinkButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, the URI you pass
to the constructor is used as a label for the widget.

The URI bound to a `LinkButton` can be set specifically using
`LinkButton::set_uri`, and retrieved using `LinkButton::get_uri`.

By default, `LinkButton` calls `gtk_show_uri` when the button is
clicked. This behaviour can be overridden by connecting to the
`LinkButton::activate-link` signal and returning `true` from the
signal handler.

# CSS nodes

`LinkButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .link style class.

# Accessibility

`LinkButton` uses the `AccessibleRole::Link` role.

# Implements

[`ButtonExt`](trait.ButtonExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html), [`ActionableExtManual`](prelude/trait.ActionableExtManual.html)
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn new -->
Creates a new `LinkButton` with the URI as its text.
## `uri`
a valid URI

# Returns

a new link button widget.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new `LinkButton` containing a label.
## `uri`
a valid URI
## `label`
the text of the button

# Returns

a new link button widget.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_uri -->
Retrieves the URI set using `LinkButton::set_uri`.

# Returns

a valid URI. The returned string is owned by the link button
 and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_visited -->
Retrieves the “visited” state of the URI where the `LinkButton`
points. The button becomes visited when it is clicked. If the URI
is changed on the button, the “visited” state is unset again.

The state may also be changed using `LinkButton::set_visited`.

# Returns

`true` if the link has been visited, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_uri -->
Sets `uri` as the URI where the `LinkButton` points. As a side-effect
this unsets the “visited” state of the button.
## `uri`
a valid URI
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_visited -->
Sets the “visited” state of the URI where the `LinkButton`
points. See `LinkButton::get_visited` for more details.
## `visited`
the new “visited” state
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn connect_activate_link -->
The ::activate-link signal is emitted each time the `LinkButton`
has been clicked.

The default handler will call `gtk_show_uri` with the URI stored inside
the `LinkButton:uri` property.

To override the default behavior, you can connect to the ::activate-link
signal and stop the propagation of the signal by returning `true` from
your handler.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_property_uri -->
The URI bound to this button.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_property_uri -->
The URI bound to this button.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn get_property_visited -->

different color.
<!-- impl LinkButton::fn set_property_visited -->
The 'visited' state of this button. A visited link is drawn in a
different color.
<!-- struct ListBase -->
`ListBase` is the abstract base class for GTK's list widgets.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

# Implements

<!-- trait ListBaseExt -->
Trait containing all `ListBase` methods.

# Implementors

[`GridView`](struct.GridView.html), [`ListBase`](struct.ListBase.html), [`ListView`](struct.ListView.html)
<!-- trait ListBaseExt::fn get_property_orientation -->
The orientation of the list. See `Orientable`:orientation
for details.
<!-- trait ListBaseExt::fn set_property_orientation -->
The orientation of the list. See `Orientable`:orientation
for details.
<!-- struct ListBox -->
A `ListBox` is a vertical container that contains `ListBoxRow`
children. These rows can by dynamically sorted and filtered, and
headers can be added dynamically depending on the row content.
It also allows keyboard and mouse navigation and selection like
a typical list.

Using `ListBox` is often an alternative to `TreeView`, especially
when the list contents has a more complicated layout than what is allowed
by a `CellRenderer`, or when the contents is interactive (i.e. has a
button in it).

Although a `ListBox` must have only `ListBoxRow` children you can
add any kind of widget to it via `ListBox::prepend`,
`ListBox::append` and `ListBox::insert` and a `ListBoxRow`
widget will automatically be inserted between the list and the widget.

``GtkListBoxRows`` can be marked as activatable or selectable. If a row
is activatable, `ListBox::row-activated` will be emitted for it when
the user tries to activate it. If it is selectable, the row will be marked
as selected when the user tries to select it.

# `ListBox` as `Buildable`

The `ListBox` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
setting a child as the placeholder by specifying “placeholder” as the “type”
attribute of a `<child>` element. See `ListBox::set_placeholder` for info.

# CSS nodes


```plain
list[.separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar]
╰── row[.activatable]
```

`ListBox` uses a single CSS node named list. It may carry the .separators
style class, when the `ListBox:show-separators` property is set. Each
`ListBoxRow` uses a single CSS node named row. The row nodes get the
.activatable style class added when appropriate.

The main list node may also carry style classes to select
the style of [list presentation](ListContainers.html`list`-styles):
.rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

# Accessibility

`ListBox` uses the `AccessibleRole::List` role and `ListBoxRow` uses
the `AccessibleRole::ListItem` role.

# Implements

<!-- impl ListBox::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBox` container.

# Returns

a new `ListBox`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn append -->
Append a widget to the list. If a sort function is set, the widget will
actually be inserted at the calculated position.
## `child`
the `Widget` to add
<!-- impl ListBox::fn bind_model -->
Binds `model` to `self`.

If `self` was already bound to a model, that previous binding is
destroyed.

The contents of `self` are cleared and then filled with widgets that
represent items from `model`. `self` is updated whenever `model` changes.
If `model` is `None`, `self` is left empty.

It is undefined to add or remove widgets directly (for example, with
`ListBox::insert`) while `self` is bound to a
model.

Note that using a model is incompatible with the filtering and sorting
functionality in `ListBox`. When using a model, filtering and sorting
should be implemented by the model.
## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to be bound to `self`
## `create_widget_func`
a function that creates widgets for items
 or `None` in case you also passed `None` as `model`
## `user_data`
user data passed to `create_widget_func`
## `user_data_free_func`
function for freeing `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn drag_highlight_row -->
This is a helper function for implementing DnD onto a `ListBox`.
The passed in `row` will be highlighted by setting the
`StateFlags::DropActive` state and any previously highlighted
row will be unhighlighted.

The row will also be unhighlighted when the widget gets
a drag leave event.
## `row`
a `ListBoxRow`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn drag_unhighlight_row -->
If a row has previously been highlighted via `ListBox::drag_highlight_row`
it will have the highlight removed.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_activate_on_single_click -->
Returns whether rows activate on single clicks.

# Returns

`true` if rows are activated on single click, `false` otherwise
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_adjustment -->
Gets the adjustment (if any) that the widget uses to
for vertical scrolling.

# Returns

the adjustment
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_row_at_index -->
Gets the n-th child in the list (not counting headers).
If `_index` is negative or larger than the number of items in the
list, `None` is returned.
## `index_`
the index of the row

# Returns

the child `Widget` or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_row_at_y -->
Gets the row at the `y` position.
## `y`
position

# Returns

the row or `None`
 in case no row exists for the given y coordinate.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_selected_row -->
Gets the selected row.

Note that the box may allow multiple selection, in which
case you should use `ListBox::selected_foreach` to
find all selected rows.

# Returns

the selected row
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_selected_rows -->
Creates a list of all selected children.

# Returns


 A `glib::List` containing the `Widget` for each selected child.
 Free with `glib::List::free` when done.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_selection_mode -->
Gets the selection mode of the listbox.

# Returns

a `SelectionMode`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn get_show_separators -->
Returns whether the list box should show separators
between rows.

# Returns

`true` if the list box shows separators
<!-- impl ListBox::fn insert -->
Insert the `child` into the `self` at `position`. If a sort function is
set, the widget will actually be inserted at the calculated position.

If `position` is -1, or larger than the total number of items in the
`self`, then the `child` will be appended to the end.
## `child`
the `Widget` to add
## `position`
the position to insert `child` in
<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_filter -->
Update the filtering for all rows. Call this when result
of the filter function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor. For instance, this would be used
if the filter function just looked for a specific search
string and the entry with the search string has changed.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_headers -->
Update the separators for all rows. Call this when result
of the header function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn invalidate_sort -->
Update the sorting for all rows. Call this when result
of the sort function on the `self` is changed due
to an external factor.

otherwise you need to double-click.
## `single`
a boolean
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment (if any) that the widget uses to
for vertical scrolling. For instance, this is used
to get the page size for PageUp/Down key handling.

In the normal case when the `self` is packed inside
a `ScrolledWindow` the adjustment from that will
be picked up automatically, so there is no need
to manually do that.
## `adjustment`
the adjustment, or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_filter_func -->
By setting a filter function on the `self` one can decide dynamically which
of the rows to show. For instance, to implement a search function on a list that
filters the original list to only show the matching rows.

The `filter_func` will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) or
when `ListBox::invalidate_filter` is called.

Note that using a filter function is incompatible with using a model
(see `ListBox::bind_model`).
## `filter_func`
callback that lets you filter which rows to show
## `user_data`
user data passed to `filter_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_header_func -->
By setting a header function on the `self` one can dynamically add headers
in front of rows, depending on the contents of the row and its position in the list.
For instance, one could use it to add headers in front of the first item of a
new kind, in a list sorted by the kind.

The `update_header` can look at the current header widget using `ListBoxRowExt::get_header`
and either update the state of the widget as needed, or set a new one using
`ListBoxRowExt::set_header`. If no header is needed, set the header to `None`.

Note that you may get many calls `update_header` to this for a particular row when e.g.
changing things that don’t affect the header. In this case it is important for performance
to not blindly replace an existing header with an identical one.

The `update_header` function will be called for each row after the call, and it will
continue to be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) and when
the row before changes (either by `ListBoxRowExt::changed` on the previous row, or when
the previous row becomes a different row). It is also called for all rows when
`ListBox::invalidate_headers` is called.
## `update_header`
callback that lets you add row headers
## `user_data`
user data passed to `update_header`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_placeholder -->
Sets the placeholder widget that is shown in the list when
it doesn't display any visible children.
## `placeholder`
a `Widget` or `None`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_selection_mode -->
Sets how selection works in the listbox.
See `SelectionMode` for details.
## `mode`
The `SelectionMode`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_show_separators -->
Sets whether the list box should show separators
between rows.
## `show_separators`
`true` to show separators
<!-- impl ListBox::fn set_sort_func -->
By setting a sort function on the `self` one can dynamically reorder the rows
of the list, based on the contents of the rows.

The `sort_func` will be called for each row after the call, and will continue to
be called each time a row changes (via `ListBoxRowExt::changed`) and when
`ListBox::invalidate_sort` is called.

Note that using a sort function is incompatible with using a model
(see `ListBox::bind_model`).
## `sort_func`
the sort function
## `user_data`
user data passed to `sort_func`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`
<!-- impl ListBox::fn unselect_all -->
Unselect all children of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn unselect_row -->
Unselects a single row of `self`, if the selection mode allows it.
## `row`
the row to unselected
<!-- impl ListBox::fn connect_row_activated -->
The ::row-activated signal is emitted when a row has been activated by the user.
## `row`
the activated row
<!-- impl ListBox::fn connect_row_selected -->
The ::row-selected signal is emitted when a new row is selected, or
(with a `None` `row`) when the selection is cleared.

When the `box_` is using `SelectionMode::Multiple`, this signal will not
give you the full picture of selection changes, and you should use
the `ListBox::selected-rows-changed` signal instead.
## `row`
the selected row
<!-- impl ListBox::fn connect_select_all -->
The ::select-all signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to select all children of the box, if the selection
mode permits it.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-a.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn connect_selected_rows_changed -->
The ::selected-rows-changed signal is emitted when the
set of selected rows changes.
<!-- impl ListBox::fn connect_unselect_all -->
The ::unselect-all signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to unselect all children of the box, if the selection
mode permits it.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-Shift-a.

<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt -->
Trait containing all `ListBoxRow` methods.

# Implementors

<!-- impl ListBoxRow::fn new -->
Creates a new `ListBoxRow`, to be used as a child of a `ListBox`.

# Returns

a new `ListBoxRow`
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn changed -->
Marks `self` as changed, causing any state that depends on this
to be updated. This affects sorting, filtering and headers.

Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
used for the row functions. For instance, if the list is
mirroring some external data set, and *two* rows changed in the
external data set then when you call `ListBoxRowExt::changed`
on the first row the sort function must only read the new data
for the first of the two changed rows, otherwise the resorting
of the rows will be wrong.

This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data
model you have to duplicate the data that affects the listbox
row functions into the row widgets themselves. Another alternative
is to call `ListBox::invalidate_sort` on any model change,
but that is more expensive.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_activatable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property
for this row.

# Returns

`true` if the row is activatable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget of `self`.

# Returns

the child widget of `self`
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_header -->
Returns the current header of the `self`. This can be used
in a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc`` to see if there is a header
set already, and if so to update the state of it.

# Returns

the current header, or `None` if none
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_index -->
Gets the current index of the `self` in its `ListBox` container.

# Returns

the index of the `self`, or -1 if the `self` is not in a listbox
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_selectable -->
Gets the value of the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property
for this row.

# Returns

`true` if the row is selectable

Returns whether the child is currently selected in its
`ListBox` container.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is selected
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_activatable -->
Set the `ListBoxRow:activatable` property for this row.
## `activatable`
`true` to mark the row as activatable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_child -->
Sets the child widget of `self_`.
## `child`
the child widget
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_header -->
Sets the current header of the `self`. This is only allowed to be called
from a ``GtkListBoxUpdateHeaderFunc``. It will replace any existing
header in the row, and be shown in front of the row in the listbox.
## `header`
the header, or `None`
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_selectable -->
Set the `ListBoxRow:selectable` property for this row.
## `selectable`
`true` to mark the row as selectable
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn connect_activate -->
This is a keybinding signal, which will cause this row to be activated.

If you want to be notified when the user activates a row (by key or not),
use the `ListBox::row-activated` signal on the row’s parent `ListBox`.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_property_activatable -->
The property determines whether the `ListBox::row-activated`
signal will be emitted for this row.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_property_activatable -->
The property determines whether the `ListBox::row-activated`
signal will be emitted for this row.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn get_property_selectable -->
The property determines whether this row can be selected.
<!-- trait ListBoxRowExt::fn set_property_selectable -->
The property determines whether this row can be selected.
<!-- struct ListItem -->
`ListItem` is the object that list-handling containers such
as `ListView` use to represent items in a `gio::ListModel`. They are
managed by the container and cannot be created by application code.

``GtkListItems`` need to be populated by application code. This is done by
calling `ListItem::set_child`.

``GtkListItems`` exist in 2 stages:

1. The unbound stage where the listitem is not currently connected to
 an item in the list. In that case, the `ListItem:item` property is
 set to `None`.

2. The bound stage where the listitem references an item from the list.
 The `ListItem:item` property is not `None`.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_activatable -->
Checks if a list item has been set to be activatable via
`ListItem::set_activatable`.

# Returns

`true` if the item is activatable
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_child -->
Gets the child previously set via `ListItem::set_child` or
`None` if none was set.

# Returns

The child
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_item -->
Gets the item that is currently displayed in model that `self` is
currently bound to or `None` if `self` is unbound.

# Returns

The item displayed
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_position -->
Gets the position in the model that `self` currently displays.
If `self` is unbound, `GTK_INVALID_LIST_POSITION` is returned.

# Returns

The position of this item
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_selectable -->
Checks if a list item has been set to be selectable via
`ListItem::set_selectable`.

Do not confuse this function with `ListItem::get_selected`.

# Returns

`true` if the item is selectable
<!-- impl ListItem::fn get_selected -->
Checks if the item is displayed as selected. The selected state is
maintained by the container and its list model and cannot be set
otherwise.

# Returns

`true` if the item is selected.
<!-- impl ListItem::fn set_activatable -->
Sets `self` to be activatable.

If an item is activatable, double-clicking on the item, using
the Return key or calling `WidgetExt::activate` will activate
the item. Activating instructs the containing view to handle
activation. `ListView` for example will be emitting the
`ListView::activate` signal.

By default, list items are activatable
## `activatable`
if the item should be activatable
<!-- impl ListItem::fn set_child -->
Sets the child to be used for this listitem.

This function is typically called by applications when
setting up a listitem so that the widget can be reused when
binding it multiple times.

<!-- impl ListItem::fn set_selectable -->
Sets `self` to be selectable. If an item is selectable, clicking
on the item or using the keyboard will try to select or unselect
the item. If this succeeds is up to the model to determine, as
it is managing the selected state.

Note that this means that making an item non-selectable has no
influence on the selected state at all. A non-selectable item
may still be selected.

By default, list items are selectable. When rebinding them to
a new item, they will also be reset to be selectable by GTK.

<!-- struct ListItemFactory -->
`ListItemFactory` is one of the core concepts of handling list widgets.
It is the object tasked with creating widgets for items taken from a
`gio::ListModel` when the views need them and updating them as the items
displayed by the view change.

A view is usually only able to display anything after both a factory
and a model have been set on the view. So it is important that you do
not skip this step when setting up your first view.

Because views do not display the whole list at once but only a few
items, they only need to maintain a few widgets at a time. They will
instruct the `ListItemFactory` to create these widgets and bind them
to the items that are currently displayed.
As the list model changes or the user scrolls to the list, the items will
change and the view will instruct the factory to bind the widgets to those
new items.

The actual widgets used for displaying those widgets is provided by you.

When the factory needs widgets created, it will create a `ListItem` and
hand it to your code to set up a widget for. This list item will provide
various properties with information about what item to display and provide
you with some opportunities to configure its behavior. See the `ListItem`
documentation for further details.

Various implementations of `ListItemFactory` exist to allow you different
ways to provide those widgets. The most common implementations are
`BuilderListItemFactory` which takes a `Builder` .ui file and then creates
widgets and manages everything automatically from the information in that file
and `SignalListItemFactory` which allows you to connect to signals with your
own code and retain full control over how the widgets are setup and managed.

A `ListItemFactory` is supposed to be final - that means its behavior should
not change and the first widget created from it should behave the same way as
the last widget created from it.
If you intend to do changes to the behavior, it is recommended that you create
a new `ListItemFactory` which will allow the views to recreate its widgets.

Once you have chosen your factory and created it, you need to set it on the
view widget you want to use it with, such as via `ListView::set_factory`.
Reusing factories across different views is allowed, but very uncommon.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- struct ListStore -->
The `ListStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequentialy,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view.
Finally, it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk4-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

The `ListStore` can accept most GObject types as a column type, though
it can’t accept all custom types. Internally, it will keep a copy of
data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer). Columns that
accept `GObjects` are handled a little differently. The
`ListStore` will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
value. As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
application writer to call `TreeModel::row_changed` to emit the
`TreeModel::row_changed` signal. This most commonly affects lists with
``GdkTextures`` stored.

An example for creating a simple list store:

```C
enum {
  COLUMN_STRING,
  COLUMN_INT,
  COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

{
  GtkListStore *list_store;
  GtkTreePath *path;
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  int i;

  list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                   G_TYPE_STRING,
                                   G_TYPE_INT,
                                   G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
      char *some_data;

      some_data = get_some_data (i);

      // Add a new row to the model
      gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
      gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                          COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
                          COLUMN_INT, i,
                          COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
                          -1);

      // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
      // we free some_data.
      g_free (some_data);
    }

  // Modify a particular row
  path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
  gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),
                           &iter,
                           path);
  gtk_tree_path_free (path);
  gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                      COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,
                      -1);
}
```

# Performance Considerations

Internally, the `ListStore` was originally implemented with a linked list
with a tail pointer. As a result, it was fast at data insertion and deletion,
and not fast at random data access. The `ListStore` sets the
`TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag, which means that ``GtkTreeIters`` can be
cached while the row exists. Thus, if access to a particular row is needed
often and your code is expected to run on older versions of GTK, it is worth
keeping the iter around.

# Atomic Operations

It is important to note that only the methods
`GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` and `GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_valuesv`
are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
values filled in in a single operation with regard to `TreeModel` signaling.
In contrast, using e.g. `GtkListStoreExt::append` and then `GtkListStoreExt::set`
will first create a row, which triggers the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal
on `ListStore`. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
connecting to `TreeModel::row-inserted` on this particular store should be prepared
for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
if you are wrapping the `ListStore` inside a `TreeModelFilter` and are
using a ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``. Using any of the non-atomic operations
to append rows to the `ListStore` will cause the
``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc`` to be visited with an empty row first; the
function must be prepared for that.

# `ListStore` as `Buildable`

The `ListStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
`<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.

Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
is to separate the two, as far as possible.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:

```C
<object class="GtkListStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
  <data>
    <row>
      <col id="0">John</col>
      <col id="1">Doe</col>
      <col id="2">25</col>
    </row>
    <row>
      <col id="0">Johan</col>
      <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
      <col id="2">50</col>
    </row>
  </data>
</object>
```

<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt -->
Trait containing all `ListStore` methods.

# Implementors

[`ListStore`](struct.ListStore.html)
<!-- impl ListStore::fn new -->
Creates a new list store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_list_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_TEXTURE);` will create a new `ListStore` with three columns, of type
int, string and `gdk::Texture`, respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- impl ListStore::fn newv -->
Non-vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the list store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `ListStore`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from the list store.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows on the list,
then the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to the beginning of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to
this new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill
in values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows in the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with the
values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_list_store_insert_with_values (list_store, iter, position...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
static void
insert_value (GtkListStore *list_store,
              GtkTreeIter  *iter,
              int           position)
{
  gtk_list_store_insert (list_store, iter, position);
  gtk_list_store_set (list_store,
                      iter
                      // ...
                      );
}
```
with the difference that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and, if the list store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted list store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing
 rows
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `GtkListStoreExt::insert_with_values` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings.

## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays

> purposes.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `ListStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the start of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. Note that this
function only works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter`
will be moved to the end of the list.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. `iter` will be changed to point to this new
row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in
values, you need to call `GtkListStoreExt::set` or `ListStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepend row
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn remove -->
Removes the given row from the list store. After being removed,
`iter` is set to be the next valid row, or invalidated if it pointed
to the last row in `self`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is valid, `false` if not.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn reorder -->
Reorders `self` to follow the order indicated by `new_order`. Note that
this function only works with unsorted stores.
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new
 position of each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`. It must have
 exactly as many items as the list store’s length.
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write `gtk_list_store_set (store, iter,
0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
row iterator
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from `ListStore`,
and should only be used when constructing a new `ListStore`. It will not
function after a row has been added, or a method on the `TreeModel`
interface is called.
## `n_columns`
Number of columns for the list store
## `types`
An array length n of `GTypes`
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set_valist -->

## `column`
column number to modify
## `value`
new value for the cell
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn set_valuesv -->
A variant of `GtkListStoreExt::set_valist` which
takes the columns and values as two arrays, instead of
varargs. This function is mainly intended for
language-bindings and in case the number of columns to
change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- trait GtkListStoreExt::fn swap -->
Swaps `a` and `b` in `self`. Note that this function only works with
unsorted stores.
## `a`
A `TreeIter`.
## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct ListView -->
`ListView` is a widget to present a view into a large dynamic list of items.

`ListView` uses its factory to generate one row widget for each visible item
and shows them in a linear display, either vertically or horizontally. The
`ListView:show-separators` property offers a simple way to display separators
between the rows.

`ListView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
`ListView:enable-rubberband`.

If you need multiple columns with headers, see `ColumnView`.

To learn more about the list widget framework, see the [overview](`ListWidget`).

An example of using `ListView`:

```plain
listview[.separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar][.data-table]
├── row
│
├── row
│
┊
╰── [rubberband]

```

`ListView` uses a single CSS node named listview. It may carry the
.separators style class, when `ListView:show-separators` property
is set. Each child widget uses a single CSS node named row. For
rubberband selection, a node with name rubberband is used.

The main listview node may also carry style classes to select
the style of [list presentation](ListContainers.html`list`-styles):
.rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

# Accessibility

`ListView` uses the `AccessibleRole::List` role, and the list
items use the `AccessibleRole::ListItem` role.

<!-- struct LockButton -->
`LockButton` is a widget that can be used in control panels or
preference dialogs to allow users to obtain and revoke authorizations
needed to operate the controls. The required authorization is represented
by a `gio::Permission` object. Concrete implementations of `gio::Permission` may use
PolicyKit or some other authorization framework. To obtain a PolicyKit-based
`gio::Permission`, use `polkit_permission_new`.

If the user is not currently allowed to perform the action, but can obtain
the permission, the widget looks like this:

![](lockbutton-locked.png)

and the user can click the button to request the permission. Depending
on the platform, this may pop up an authentication dialog or ask the user
to authenticate in some other way. Once the user has obtained the permission,
the widget changes to this:

![](lockbutton-unlocked.png)

and the permission can be dropped again by clicking the button. If the user
is not able to obtain the permission at all, the widget looks like this:

![](lockbutton-sorry.png)

If the user has the permission and cannot drop it, the button is hidden.

The text (and tooltips) that are shown in the various cases can be adjusted
with the `LockButton:text-lock`, `LockButton:text-unlock`,
`LockButton:tooltip-lock`, `LockButton:tooltip-unlock` and
`LockButton:tooltip-not-authorized` properties.

`MapListModel` is a list model that takes a list model and maps the items
in that model to different items according to a ``GtkMapListModelMapFunc``.

Example: Create a list of ``GtkEventControllers``

```text

map function or `None` to not map items
## `user_data`
user data passed to `map_func`
## `user_destroy`
destroy notifier for `user_data`

# Returns

a new `MapListModel`
<!-- impl MapListModel::fn get_model -->
Gets the model that is currently being mapped or `None` if none.

# Returns

The model that gets mapped
<!-- impl MapListModel::fn has_map -->
Checks if a map function is currently set on `self`

# Returns

`true` if a map function is set
<!-- impl MapListModel::fn set_map_func -->
Sets the function used to map items. The function will be called whenever
an item needs to be mapped and must return the item to use for the given
input item.

Note that `MapListModel` may call this function multiple times on the
same item, because it may delete items it doesn't need anymore.

GTK makes no effort to ensure that `map_func` conforms to the item type
of `self`. It assumes that the caller knows what they are doing and the map
function returns items of the appropriate type.
## `map_func`
map function or `None` to not map items
## `user_data`
user data passed to `map_func`
## `user_destroy`

`MediaFile` is the implementation for media file usage with `MediaStream`.

This provides a simple way to play back video files with GTK.

GTK provides a GIO extension point for `MediaFile` implementations
to allow for external implementations using various media frameworks.
GTK itself includes implementations using GStreamer and ffmpeg.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

`MediaStream` is the integration point for media playback inside GTK.

GTK provides an implementation of the `MediaStream` interface that
is called `MediaFile`.

Apart from application-facing API for stream playback, `MediaStream`
has a number of APIs that are only useful for implementations and should
not be used in applications:
`MediaStreamExt::prepared`,
`MediaStreamExt::unprepared`,
`MediaStreamExt::update`,
`MediaStreamExt::ended`,
`MediaStreamExt::seek_success`,
`MediaStreamExt::seek_failed`,
`MediaStream::gerror`,
`MediaStreamExt::error`,
`MediaStreamExt::error_valist`.

<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn ended -->
Pauses the media stream and marks it as ended. This is a hint only, calls
to `MediaStream`.`play` may still happen.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn error -->
Sets `self` into an error state using a `printf`-style format string.

This is a utility function that calls `MediaStream::gerror`. See
that function for details.
## `domain`
error domain
## `code`
error code
## `format`
`printf`-style format for error message
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn error_valist -->
Sets `self` into an error state using a `printf`-style format string.

This is a utility function that calls `MediaStream::gerror`. See
that function for details.
## `domain`
error domain
## `code`
error code
## `format`
`printf`-style format for error message
## `args`
`va_list` of parameters for the message format
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn gerror -->
Sets `self` into an error state. This will pause the stream
(you can check for an error via `MediaStreamExt::get_error` in
your `MediaStream`.`pause` implementation), abort pending seeks
and mark the stream as prepared.

if the stream is already in an error state, this call will be ignored
and the existing error will be retained.
FIXME: Or do we want to set the new error?

To unset an error, the stream must be reset via a call to
`MediaStreamExt::unprepared`.
## `error`
the `glib::Error` to set
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_duration -->
Gets the duration of the stream. If the duration is not known,
0 will be returned.

# Returns

the duration of the stream or 0 if not known.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_ended -->
Returns whether the streams playback is finished.

# Returns

`true` if playback is finished
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_error -->
If the stream is in an error state, returns the `glib::Error` explaining that state.
Any type of error can be reported here depending on the implementation of the
media stream.

A media stream in an error cannot be operated on, calls like
`MediaStreamExt::play` or `MediaStreamExt::seek` will not have any effect.

`MediaStream` itself does not provide a way to unset an error, but
implementations may provide options. For example, a `MediaFile` will unset
errors when a new source is set with ie `MediaFileExt::set_file`.

# Returns

`None` if not in an error state or
 the `glib::Error` of the stream
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_loop -->
Returns whether the stream is set to loop. See
`MediaStreamExt::set_loop` for details.

# Returns

`true` if the stream should loop
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_muted -->
Returns whether the audio for the stream is muted.
See `MediaStreamExt::set_muted` for details.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is muted
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_playing -->
Return whether the stream is currently playing.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is playing
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_timestamp -->
Returns the current presentation timestamp in microseconds.

# Returns

the timestamp in microseconds
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_volume -->
Returns the volume of the audio for the stream.
See `MediaStreamExt::set_volume` for details.

# Returns

volume of the stream from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn has_audio -->
Returns whether the stream has audio.

# Returns

`true` if the stream has audio
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn has_video -->
Returns whether the stream has video.

# Returns

`true` if the stream has video
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_prepared -->
Returns whether the stream has finished initializing and existence of
audio and video is known.

# Returns

`true` if the stream is prepared
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_seekable -->
Checks if a stream may be seekable.

This is meant to be a hint. Streams may not allow seeking even if
this function returns `true`. However, if this function returns
`false`, streams are guaranteed to not be seekable and user interfaces
may hide controls that allow seeking.

It is allowed to call `MediaStreamExt::seek` on a non-seekable
stream, though it will not do anything.

# Returns

`true` if the stream may support seeking
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn is_seeking -->
Checks if there is currently a seek operation going on.

# Returns

`true` if a seek operation is ongoing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn pause -->
Pauses playback of the stream. If the stream
is not playing, do nothing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn play -->
Starts playing the stream. If the stream
is in error or already playing, do nothing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn prepared -->
Called by `MediaStream` implementations to advertise the stream
being ready to play and providing details about the stream.

Note that the arguments are hints. If the stream implementation
cannot determine the correct values, it is better to err on the
side of caution and return `true`. User interfaces will use those
values to determine what controls to show.

This function may not be called again until the stream has been
reset via `MediaStreamExt::unprepared`.
## `has_audio`
`true` if the stream should advertise audio support
## `has_video`
`true` if the stream should advertise video support
## `seekable`
`true` if the stream should advertise seekability
## `duration`
The duration of the stream or 0 if unknown
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn realize -->
Called by users to attach the media stream to a `gdk::Surface` they manage.
The stream can then access the resources of `surface` for its rendering
purposes. In particular, media streams might want to create
``GdkGLContexts`` or sync to the `gdk::FrameClock`.

Whoever calls this function is responsible for calling
`MediaStreamExt::unrealize` before either the stream or `surface` get
destroyed.

Multiple calls to this function may happen from different users of the
video, even with the same `surface`. Each of these calls must be followed
by its own call to `MediaStreamExt::unrealize`.

It is not required to call this function to make a media stream work.
## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek -->
Start a seek operation on `self` to `timestamp`. If `timestamp` is out of range,
it will be clamped.

Seek operations may not finish instantly. While a seek operation is
in process, the `MediaStream`:seeking property will be set.

When calling `MediaStreamExt::seek` during an ongoing seek operation,
the new seek will override any pending seek.
## `timestamp`
timestamp to seek to.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek_failed -->
Ends a seek operation started via `MediaStream`.`seek` as a failure.
This will not cause an error on the stream and will assume that
playback continues as if no seek had happened.

See `MediaStreamExt::seek_success` for the other way of
ending a seek.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn seek_success -->
Ends a seek operation started via `MediaStream`.`seek` successfully.
This function will unset the `MediaStream`:ended property if it was
set.

See `MediaStreamExt::seek_failed` for the other way of
ending a seek.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_loop -->
Sets whether the stream should loop, ie restart playback from
the beginning instead of stopping at the end.

Not all streams may support looping, in particular non-seekable
streams. Those streams will ignore the loop setting and just end.
## `loop_`
`true` if the stream should loop
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_muted -->
Sets whether the audio stream should be muted. Muting a stream will
cause no audio to be played, but it does not modify the volume.
This means that muting and then unmuting the stream will restore
the volume settings.

If the stream has no audio, calling this function will still work
but it will not have an audible effect.
## `muted`
`true` if the stream should be muted
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_playing -->
Starts or pauses playback of the stream.
## `playing`
whether to start or pause playback
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_volume -->
Sets the volume of the audio stream. This function call will work even if
the stream is muted.

The given `volume` should range from 0.0 for silence to 1.0 for as loud as
possible. Values outside of this range will be clamped to the nearest
value.

If the stream has no audio or is muted, calling this function will still
work but it will not have an immediate audible effect. When the stream is
unmuted, the new volume setting will take effect.
## `volume`
New volume of the stream from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn unprepared -->
Resets a given media stream implementation. `MediaStreamExt::prepared`
can now be called again.

This function will also reset any error state the stream was in.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn unrealize -->
Undoes a previous call to `MediaStreamExt::realize` and causes
the stream to release all resources it had allocated from `surface`.
## `surface`
the `gdk::Surface` the stream was realized with
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn update -->
Media stream implementations should regularly call this function to
update the timestamp reported by the stream. It is up to
implementations to call this at the frequency they deem appropriate.
## `timestamp`
the new timestamp
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_duration -->
The stream's duration in microseconds or 0 if unknown.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_ended -->
Set when playback has finished.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_error -->
`None` for a properly working stream or the `glib::Error` that the stream is in.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_has_audio -->
Whether the stream contains audio
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_has_video -->
Whether the stream contains video
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_loop -->
Try to restart the media from the beginning once it ended.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_loop -->
Try to restart the media from the beginning once it ended.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_muted -->
Whether the audio stream should be muted.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_muted -->
Whether the audio stream should be muted.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_playing -->
Whether the stream is currently playing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_playing -->
Whether the stream is currently playing.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_prepared -->
Whether the stream has finished initializing and existence of
audio and video is known.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_prepared -->
Whether the stream has finished initializing and existence of
audio and video is known.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_seekable -->
Set unless the stream is known to not support seeking.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_seeking -->
Set while a seek is in progress.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_timestamp -->
The current presentation timestamp in microseconds.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn get_property_volume -->
Volume of the audio stream.
<!-- trait MediaStreamExt::fn set_property_volume -->
Volume of the audio stream.
<!-- struct MenuButton -->
The `MenuButton` widget is used to display a popup when clicked on.
This popup can be provided either as a `Popover` or as an abstract
`gio::MenuModel`.

The `MenuButton` widget can show either an icon (set with the
`MenuButton:icon-name` property) or a label (set with the
`MenuButton:label` property). If neither is explicitly set,
a `Image` is automatically created, using an arrow image oriented
according to `MenuButton:direction` or the generic “open-menu-symbolic”
icon if the direction is not set.

The positioning of the popup is determined by the `MenuButton:direction`
property of the menu button.

For menus, the `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties of the
menu are also taken into account. For example, when the direction is
`ArrowType::Down` and the horizontal alignment is `Align::Start`, the
menu will be positioned below the button, with the starting edge
(depending on the text direction) of the menu aligned with the starting
edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

Sets `func` to be called when a popup is about to be shown.
`func` should use one of

 - `MenuButton::set_popover`
 - `MenuButton::set_menu_model`

to set a popup for `self`.
If `func` is non-`None`, `self` will always be sensitive.

Using this function will not reset the menu widget attached to `self`.
Instead, this can be done manually in `func`.

well as changing the arrow’s direction. The child will not
be changed to an arrow if it was customized.

If the does not fit in the available space in the given direction,
GTK will its best to keep it inside the screen and fully visible.

If you pass `ArrowType::None` for a `direction`, the popup will behave
as if you passed `ArrowType::Down` (although you won’t see any arrows).

<!-- impl MenuButton::fn set_property_popover -->
The `Popover` that will be popped up when the button is clicked.
<!-- struct MessageDialog -->
`MessageDialog` presents a dialog with some message text. It’s simply a
convenience widget; you could construct the equivalent of `MessageDialog`
from `Dialog` without too much effort, but `MessageDialog` saves typing.

The easiest way to do a modal message dialog is to use the `DialogFlags::Modal`
flag, which will call `GtkWindowExt::set_modal` internally. The dialog will
prevent interaction with the parent window until it's hidden or destroyed.
You can use the `Dialog::response` signal to know when the user dismissed
the dialog.

An example for using a modal dialog:

```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT | GTK_DIALOG_MODAL;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                  filename,
                                  g_strerror (errno));
 // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
 // (e.g. clicks a button)

 g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                   NULL);
```

You might do a non-modal `MessageDialog` simply by omitting the
`DialogFlags::Modal` flag:


```C
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,

# `MessageDialog` as `Buildable`

The `MessageDialog` implementation of the `Buildable` interface exposes
the message area as an internal child with the name “message_area”.

# Implements

[`DialogExt`](trait.DialogExt.html), [`GtkWindowExt`](trait.GtkWindowExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`NativeExt`](trait.NativeExt.html), [`RootExt`](trait.RootExt.html), [`ShortcutManagerExt`](trait.ShortcutManagerExt.html), [`DialogExtManual`](prelude/trait.DialogExtManual.html), [`GtkWindowExtManual`](prelude/trait.GtkWindowExtManual.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text
the user may want to see. When the user clicks a button a “response”
signal is emitted with response IDs from `ResponseType`. See
`Dialog` for more details.
## `parent`
transient parent, or `None` for none
## `flags`
flags
## `type_`
type of message
## `buttons`
set of buttons to use
## `message_format`
`printf`-style format string, or `None`

# Returns

a new `MessageDialog`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn new_with_markup -->
Creates a new message dialog, which is a simple dialog with some text that
is marked up with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
When the user clicks a button a “response” signal is emitted with
response IDs from `ResponseType`. See `Dialog` for more details.

Special XML characters in the `printf` arguments passed to this
function will automatically be escaped as necessary.
(See `g_markup_printf_escaped` for how this is implemented.)
Usually this is what you want, but if you have an existing
Pango markup string that you want to use literally as the
label, then you need to use `MessageDialog::set_markup`
instead, since you can’t pass the markup string either
as the format (it might contain “%” characters) or as a string
argument.

```C
 GtkWidget *dialog;
 GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                  flags,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  NULL);
 gtk_message_dialog_set_markup (GTK_MESSAGE_DIALOG (dialog),
                                markup);
```
## `parent`
transient parent, or `None` for none
## `flags`
flags
## `type_`
type of message
## `buttons`
set of buttons to use
## `message_format`
`printf`-style format string, or `None`

# Returns

a new `MessageDialog`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn format_secondary_markup -->
Sets the secondary text of the message dialog to be `message_format` (with
`printf`-style), which is marked up with the
[Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

Due to an oversight, this function does not escape special XML characters
like `MessageDialog::new_with_markup` does. Thus, if the arguments
may contain special XML characters, you should use `g_markup_printf_escaped`
to escape it.


```C
char *msg;

msg = g_markup_printf_escaped (message_format, ...);
gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup (message_dialog,
                                            "%s", msg);
g_free (msg);
```
## `message_format`
`printf`-style markup string (see
 [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat]), or `None`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn format_secondary_text -->
Sets the secondary text of the message dialog to be `message_format`
(with `printf`-style).
## `message_format`
`printf`-style format string, or `None`
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn get_message_area -->
Returns the message area of the dialog. This is the box where the
dialog’s primary and secondary labels are packed. You can add your
own extra content to that box and it will appear below those labels.
See `DialogExt::get_content_area` for the corresponding
function in the parent `Dialog`.

# Returns

A `Box` corresponding to the
 “message area” in the `self`.
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn set_markup -->
Sets the text of the message dialog to be `str`, which is marked
up with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
## `str`
markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat])
<!-- impl MessageDialog::fn get_property_message_area -->

<!-- trait NativeExt::fn realize -->
Realizes a `Native`.
<!-- trait NativeExt::fn unrealize -->
Unrealizes a `Native`.
<!-- struct NativeDialog -->
Native dialogs are platform dialogs that don't use `Dialog` or
`Window`. They are used in order to integrate better with a
platform, by looking the same as other native applications and
supporting platform specific features.

The `Dialog` functions cannot be used on such objects, but we
need a similar API in order to drive them. The `NativeDialog`
object is an API that allows you to do this. It allows you to set
various common properties on the dialog, as well as show and hide
it and get a `NativeDialog::response` signal when the user finished
with the dialog.

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

# Implements

[`NativeDialogExt`](trait.NativeDialogExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt -->
Trait containing all `NativeDialog` methods.

# Implementors

[`FileChooserNative`](struct.FileChooserNative.html), [`NativeDialog`](struct.NativeDialog.html)
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn destroy -->
Destroys a dialog.

When a dialog is destroyed, it will break any references it holds
to other objects. If it is visible it will be hidden and any underlying
window system resources will be destroyed.

Note that this does not release any reference to the object (as opposed to
destroying a `Window`) because there is no reference from the windowing
system to the `NativeDialog`.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the dialog is modal. See `NativeDialogExt::set_modal`.

# Returns

`true` if the dialog is set to be modal
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_title -->
Gets the title of the `NativeDialog`.

# Returns

the title of the dialog, or `None` if none has
 been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
 and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_transient_for -->
Fetches the transient parent for this window. See
`NativeDialogExt::set_transient_for`.

# Returns

the transient parent for this window,
or `None` if no transient parent has been set.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_visible -->
Determines whether the dialog is visible.

# Returns

`true` if the dialog is visible
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn hide -->
Hides the dialog if it is visilbe, aborting any interaction. Once this
is called the `NativeDialog::response` signal will not be emitted
until after the next call to `NativeDialogExt::show`.

If the dialog is not visible this does nothing.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets a dialog modal or non-modal. Modal dialogs prevent interaction
with other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogs
on top of main application windows, use
`NativeDialogExt::set_transient_for` to make the dialog transient for the
parent; most [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
will then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
## `modal`
whether the window is modal
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `NativeDialog`.
## `title`
title of the dialog
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_transient_for -->
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window.

Passing `None` for `parent` unsets the current transient window.
## `parent`
parent window, or `None`
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn show -->
Shows the dialog on the display, allowing the user to interact with
it. When the user accepts the state of the dialog the dialog will
be automatically hidden and the `NativeDialog::response` signal
will be emitted.

Multiple calls while the dialog is visible will be ignored.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn connect_response -->
Emitted when the user responds to the dialog.

When this is called the dialog has been hidden.

If you call `NativeDialogExt::hide` before the user responds to
the dialog this signal will not be emitted.
## `response_id`
the response ID
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_modal -->
Whether the window should be modal with respect to its transient parent.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_modal -->
Whether the window should be modal with respect to its transient parent.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_title -->
The title of the dialog window
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_title -->
The title of the dialog window
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the dialog, or `None` for none.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the dialog, or `None` for none.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn get_property_visible -->
Whether the window is currently visible.
<!-- trait NativeDialogExt::fn set_property_visible -->
Whether the window is currently visible.
<!-- struct NeverTrigger -->
A `ShortcutTrigger` that never triggers.

# Implements

[`ShortcutTriggerExt`](trait.ShortcutTriggerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ShortcutTriggerExtManual`](prelude/trait.ShortcutTriggerExtManual.html)
<!-- impl NeverTrigger::fn get -->
Gets the never trigger. This is a singleton for a trigger
that never triggers. Use this trigger instead of `None`
because it implements all virtual functions.

# Returns

The never trigger
<!-- struct NoSelection -->
`NoSelection` is an implementation of the `SelectionModel` interface
that does not allow selecting anything.

This model is meant to be used as a simple wrapper to `GListModels` when a
`SelectionModel` is required.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html), [`SelectionModelExt`](trait.SelectionModelExt.html)
<!-- impl NoSelection::fn new -->
Creates a new selection to handle `model`.
## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to manage, or `None`

# Returns

a new `NoSelection`
<!-- impl NoSelection::fn get_model -->
Gets the model that `self` is wrapping.

# Returns

The model being wrapped
<!-- impl NoSelection::fn set_model -->
Sets the model that `self` should wrap.
If `model` is `None`, this model will be empty.
## `model`
A `gio::ListModel` to wrap
<!-- impl NoSelection::fn get_property_model -->
The model being managed
<!-- impl NoSelection::fn set_property_model -->
The model being managed
<!-- struct Notebook -->
The `Notebook` widget is a layout container whose children are
pages that can be switched between using tab labels along one edge.

There are many configuration options for `Notebook`. Among other
things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear
(see `Notebook::set_tab_pos`), whether, if there are too many
tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling
arrows added (see `Notebook::set_scrollable`), and whether there
will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages.
(see `Notebook::popup_enable`, `Notebook::popup_disable`)

# `Notebook` as `Buildable`

The `Notebook` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing children into tabs by specifying “tab” as the
“type” attribute of a `<child>` element. Note that the content
of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled.
A tab child can be specified without specifying a `<child>`
type attribute.

To add a child widget in the notebooks action area, specify
"action-start" or “action-end” as the “type” attribute of the
`<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `Notebook`:

```plain
notebook
├── header.top
│   ├── [<action widget>]
│   ├── tabs
│   │   ├── [arrow]
│   │   ├── tab
│   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
┊   ┊   ┊
│   │   ├── tab[.reorderable-page]
│   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
│   │   ╰── [arrow]
│   ╰── [<action widget>]
│
╰── stack
    ├── <child>
    ┊
    ╰── <child>
```

`Notebook` has a main CSS node with name `notebook`, a subnode
with name `header` and below that a subnode with name `tabs` which
contains one subnode per tab with name `tab`.

If action widgets are present, their CSS nodes are placed next
to the `tabs` node. If the notebook is scrollable, CSS nodes with
name `arrow` are placed as first and last child of the `tabs` node.

The main node gets the `.frame` style class when the notebook
has a border (see `Notebook::set_show_border`).

The header node gets one of the style class `.top`, `.bottom`,
`.left` or `.right`, depending on where the tabs are placed. For
reorderable pages, the tab node gets the `.reorderable-page` class.

A `tab` node gets the `.dnd` style class while it is moved with drag-and-drop.

The nodes are always arranged from left-to-right, regardless of text direction.

# Accessibility

`Notebook` uses the following roles:

 - `AccessibleRole::Group` for the notebook widget
 - `AccessibleRole::TabList` for the list of tabs
 - `AccessibleRole::Tab` role for each tab
 - `AccessibleRole::TabPanel` for each page

Appends a page to `self`.
## `child`
the `Widget` to use as the contents of the page
## `tab_label`
the `Widget` to be used as the label
 for the page, or `None` to use the default label, “page N”

# Returns

the index (starting from 0) of the appended
 page in the notebook, or -1 if function fails
<!-- impl Notebook::fn append_page_menu -->
Appends a page to `self`, specifying the widget to use as the
label in the popup menu.
## `child`
the `Widget` to use as the contents of the page

## `menu_label`
the widget to use as a label for the
 page-switch menu, if that is enabled. If `None`, and `tab_label`
 is a `Label` or `None`, then the menu label will be a newly
 created label with the same text as `tab_label`; if `tab_label`
 is not a `Label`, `menu_label` must be specified if the
 page-switch menu is to be used.

the index (starting from 0) of the appended
 page in the notebook, or -1 if function fails
<!-- impl Notebook::fn detach_tab -->

<!-- impl Notebook::fn set_show_tabs -->
Sets whether to show the tabs for the notebook or not.
## `show_tabs`
`true` if the tabs should be shown
<!-- impl Notebook::fn set_tab_detachable -->
Sets whether the tab can be detached from `self` to another
notebook or widget.

Note that 2 notebooks must share a common group identificator
(see `Notebook::set_group_name`) to allow automatic tabs
interchange between them.

If you want a widget to interact with a notebook through DnD
(i.e.: accept dragged tabs from it) it must be set as a drop
destination and accept the target “GTK_NOTEBOOK_TAB”. The notebook
will fill the selection with a `Widget`** pointing to the child
widget that corresponds to the dropped tab.

Note that you should use `Notebook::detach_tab` instead of
`Notebook::remove_page` if you want to remove the tab from
the source notebook as part of accepting a drop. Otherwise,
the source notebook will think that the dragged tab was
removed from underneath the ongoing drag operation, and
will initiate a drag cancel animation.


```C
 static void
 on_drag_data_received (GtkWidget        *widget,
                        GdkDrop          *drop,
                        GtkSelectionData *data,
                        guint             time,
                        gpointer          user_data)
 {
   GtkDrag *drag;
   GtkWidget *notebook;
   GtkWidget **child;

   drag = gtk_drop_get_drag (drop);
   notebook = g_object_get_data (drag, "gtk-notebook-drag-origin");
   child = (void*) gtk_selection_data_get_data (data);

   // process_widget (*child);

   gtk_notebook_detach_tab (GTK_NOTEBOOK (notebook), *child);
 }
```

If you want a notebook to accept drags from other widgets,
you will have to set your own DnD code to do it.

property, but implements it only partially.
<!-- enum Overflow::variant Visible -->
No change is applied. Content is drawn at the specified
 position.
<!-- enum Overflow::variant Hidden -->
Content is clipped to the bounds of the area. Content
 outside the area is not drawn and cannot be interacted with.
<!-- struct Overlay -->
`Overlay` is a container which contains a single main child, on top
of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The position of each overlay
widget is determined by its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign`
properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to `Align::Start`
will be placed at the top left corner of the `Overlay` container,
whereas an overlay with halign set to `Align::Center` and valign set
to `Align::End` will be placed a the bottom edge of the `Overlay`,
horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin
properties of the child to non-zero values.

More complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting
to the `Overlay::get-child-position` signal.

An overlay’s minimum and natural sizes are those of its main child. The sizes
of overlay children are not considered when measuring these preferred sizes.

# `Overlay` as `Buildable`

The `Overlay` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports placing a child as an overlay by specifying “overlay” as
the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

# CSS nodes

`Overlay` has a single CSS node with the name “overlay”. Overlay children
whose alignments cause them to be positioned at an edge get the style classes
“.left”, “.right”, “.top”, and/or “.bottom” according to their position.

# Implements

<!-- impl Overlay::fn new -->
Creates a new `Overlay`.

# Returns

a new `Overlay` object.
<!-- impl Overlay::fn add_overlay -->
Adds `widget` to `self`.

The widget will be stacked on top of the main widget
added with `Overlay::set_child`.

The position at which `widget` is placed is determined
from its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties.
## `widget`
a `Widget` to be added to the container
<!-- impl Overlay::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget of `self`.

# Returns

the child widget of `self`
<!-- impl Overlay::fn get_clip_overlay -->

<!-- impl Overlay::fn set_measure_overlay -->
Sets whether `widget` is included in the measured size of `self`.

The overlay will request the size of the largest child that has
this property set to `true`. Children who are not included may
be drawn outside of `self`'s allocation if they are too large.
## `widget`
an overlay child of `Overlay`
## `measure`
whether the child should be measured
<!-- impl Overlay::fn connect_get_child_position -->
The ::get-child-position signal is emitted to determine
the position and size of any overlay child widgets. A
handler for this signal should fill `allocation` with
the desired position and size for `widget`, relative to
the 'main' child of `overlay`.

The default handler for this signal uses the `widget`'s
halign and valign properties to determine the position
and gives the widget its natural size (except that an
alignment of `Align::Fill` will cause the overlay to
be full-width/height). If the main child is a
`ScrolledWindow`, the overlays are placed relative
to its contents.
## `widget`
the child widget to position
## `allocation`
return
 location for the allocation

# Returns

`true` if the `allocation` has been filled
<!-- struct OverlayLayout -->
`OverlayLayout` is the layout manager used by `Overlay`.
It places widgets as overlays on top of the main child.

This is not a reusable layout manager, since it expects its widget
to be a `Overlay`. It only listed here so that its layout
properties get documented.

<!-- enum PadActionType -->
The type of a pad action.
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Button -->
Action is triggered by a pad button
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Ring -->
Action is triggered by a pad ring
<!-- enum PadActionType::variant Strip -->
Action is triggered by a pad strip
<!-- struct PadController -->
`PadController` is an event controller for the pads found in drawing
tablets (The collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
the stylus-sensitive area).

These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
perform no action, this event controller is provided to map those to
`gio::Action` objects, thus letting the application give those a more semantic
meaning.

Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action, some
`gdk::InputSource::TabletPad` devices feature multiple "modes", all these input
elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
being triggered. Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups,
all elements in a group share the same current mode, but different groups
may have different modes. See `gdk::DevicePad::get_n_groups` and
`gdk::DevicePad::get_group_n_modes`.

Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given
mode is defined by `PadActionEntry`, it contains an action name that
will be looked up in the given `gio::ActionGroup` and activated whenever the
specified input element and mode are triggered.

A simple example of `PadController` usage, assigning button 1 in all
modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:

```text
  GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
    { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
    …
  };

  …
  action_group = g_simple_action_group_new ();
  action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
  g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
  g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
  …
  pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (action_group, NULL);
```

The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE` bearing the value of the given axis, it

<!-- impl PadController::fn new -->
Creates a new `PadController` that will associate events from `pad` to
actions. A `None` pad may be provided so the controller manages all pad devices
generically, it is discouraged to mix `PadController` objects with `None`
and non-`None` `pad` argument on the same toplevel window, as execution order
is not guaranteed.

The `PadController` is created with no mapped actions. In order to map pad
events to actions, use `PadController::set_action_entries` or
`PadController::set_action`.

Be aware that pad events will only be delivered to ``GtkWindows``, so adding a pad
controller to any other type of widget will not have an effect.
## `group`
`gio::ActionGroup` to trigger actions from
## `pad`
A `gdk::InputSource::TabletPad` device, or `None` to handle all pads

# Returns

A newly created `PadController`
<!-- impl PadController::fn set_action -->
Adds an individual action to `self`. This action will only be activated
if the given button/ring/strip number in `index` is interacted while
the current mode is `mode`. -1 may be used for simple cases, so the action
is triggered on all modes.

The given `label` should be considered user-visible, so internationalization
rules apply. Some windowing systems may be able to use those for user
feedback.
## `type_`
the type of pad feature that will trigger this action
## `index`
the 0-indexed button/ring/strip number that will trigger this action
## `mode`
the mode that will trigger this action, or -1 for all modes.
## `label`
Human readable description of this action, this string should
 be deemed user-visible.
## `action_name`
action name that will be activated in the `gio::ActionGroup`
<!-- impl PadController::fn set_action_entries -->
This is a convenience function to add a group of action entries on
`self`. See `PadActionEntry` and `PadController::set_action`.
## `entries`

<!-- struct PageSetup -->
A `PageSetup` object stores the page size, orientation and margins.
The idea is that you can get one of these from the page setup dialog
and then pass it to the `PrintOperation` when printing.
The benefit of splitting this out of the `PrintSettings` is that
these affect the actual layout of the page, and thus need to be set
long before user prints.

## Margins ## {`print`-margins}
The margins specified in this object are the “print margins”, i.e. the
parts of the page that the printer cannot print on. These are different
from the layout margins that a word processor uses; they are typically
used to determine the minimal size for the layout
margins.

To obtain a `PageSetup` use `PageSetup::new` to get the defaults,
or use `gtk_print_run_page_setup_dialog` to show the page setup dialog
and receive the resulting page setup.

## A page setup dialog


```C
static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;
static GtkPageSetup *page_setup = NULL;

<!-- struct Paned -->
`Paned` has two panes, arranged either
horizontally or vertically. The division between
the two panes is adjustable by the user by dragging
a handle.

Child widgets are added to the panes of the widget with
`Paned::set_start_child` and `Paned::set_end_child`.
The division between the two children is set by default
from the size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the
user.

A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a
small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not
draw any relief around the children or around the separator. (The space
in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to put
each child inside a `Frame` so that the gutter appears as a ridge.
No separator is drawn if one of the children is missing.

Each child has two options that can be set, `resize` and `shrink`. If
`resize` is true, then when the `Paned` is resized, that child will
expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If `shrink` is true, then
that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user.
Setting `shrink` to `false` allows the application to set a minimum size.
If `resize` is false for both children, then this is treated as if
`resize` is true for both children.

The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set
by the user, by calling `Paned::set_position`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
paned
├── <child>
├── separator[.wide]
╰── <child>
```

`Paned` has a main CSS node with name paned, and a subnode for
the separator with name separator. The subnode gets a .wide style
class when the paned is supposed to be wide.

In horizontal orientation, the nodes are arranged based on the text
direction, so in left-to-right mode, :first-child will select the
leftmost child, while it will select the rightmost child in
RTL layouts.

## Creating a paned widget with minimum sizes.


```C
GtkWidget *hpaned = gtk_paned_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL);
GtkWidget *frame1 = gtk_frame_new (NULL);
GtkWidget *frame2 = gtk_frame_new (NULL);

gtk_widget_set_size_request (hpaned, 200, -1);

<!-- struct PasswordEntry -->
`PasswordEntry` is entry that has been tailored for entering secrets.
It does not show its contents in clear text, does not allow to copy it
to the clipboard, and it shows a warning when Caps Lock is engaged. If
the underlying platform allows it, `PasswordEntry` will also place the
text in a non-pageable memory area, to avoid it being written out to
disk by the operating system.

Optionally, it can offer a way to reveal the contents in clear text.

`PasswordEntry` provides only minimal API and should be used with the
`Editable` API.

# CSS Nodes


```plain
entry.password
╰── text
    ├── image.caps-lock-indicator
    ┊
```

`PasswordEntry` has a single CSS node with name entry that carries
a .passwordstyle class. The text Css node below it has a child with
name image and style class .caps-lock-indicator for the Caps Lock
icon, and possibly other children.

# Accessibility

`PasswordEntry` uses the `AccessibleRole::TextBox` role.

<!-- struct PickFlags -->
Flags that influence the behavior of `WidgetExt::pick`
<!-- struct PickFlags::const DEFAULT -->
The default behavior, include widgets that are receiving events
<!-- struct PickFlags::const INSENSITIVE -->
Include widgets that are insensitive
<!-- struct PickFlags::const NON_TARGETABLE -->
Include widgets that are marked as non-targetable. See `Widget:can-target`
<!-- struct Picture -->
The `Picture` widget displays a `gdk::Paintable`. Many convenience functions
are provided to make pictures simple to use. For example, if you want to load
an image from a file, and then display that, there’s a convenience function
to do this:

```C
  GtkWidget *widget;
  widget = gtk_picture_new_for_filename ("myfile.png");
```
If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the picture will contain a
“broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
`gdk::Texture::new_from_file`, then create the `Picture` with
`Picture::new_for_paintable`.

Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
files, such as image files. See the documentation of `gio::Resource` for details.
In this case, `Picture::new_for_resource` and `Picture::set_resource`
should be used.

# Sizing the paintable

You can influence how the paintable is displayed inside the `Picture`.
By turning off `Picture:keep-aspect-ratio` you can allow the paintable
to get stretched. `Picture:can-shrink` can be unset to make sure that
paintables are never made smaller than their ideal size - but be careful
if you do not know the size of the paintable in use (like when displaying
user-loaded images). This can easily cause the picture to grow larger than
the screen. And `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` can be used to make
sure the paintable doesn't fill all available space but is instead displayed
at its original size.

# CSS nodes

`Picture` has a single CSS node with the name picture.

# Accessibility

`Picture` uses the `AccessibleRole::Img` role.

a textual description of the contents
<!-- impl Picture::fn set_can_shrink -->
If set to `true`, the `self` can be made smaller than its contents.
The contents will then be scaled down when rendering.

If you want to still force a minimum size manually, consider using
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`.

Also of note is that a similar function for growing does not exist
because the grow behavior can be controlled via
`WidgetExt::set_halign` and `WidgetExt::set_valign`.

 scrolled windows share a scrollbar.
<!-- struct Popover -->
`Popover` is a bubble-like context window, primarily meant to
provide context-dependent information or options. Popovers are
attached to a widget, set with `WidgetExt::set_parent`. By
default they will point to the whole widget area, although this
behavior can be changed through `PopoverExt::set_pointing_to`.

The position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to
can also be changed through `PopoverExt::set_position`.

By default, `Popover` performs a grab, in order to ensure input events
get redirected to it while it is shown, and also so the popover is dismissed
in the expected situations (clicks outside the popover, or the Escape key
being pressed). If no such modal behavior is desired on a popover,
`PopoverExt::set_autohide` may be called on it to tweak its behavior.

## `Popover` as menu replacement

`Popover` is often used to replace menus. The best was to do this
is to use the `PopoverMenu` subclass which supports being populated
from a `gio::MenuModel` with `PopoverMenu::new_from_model`.


```plain
popover[.menu]
├── arrow
╰── contents.background
    ╰── <child>
```

The contents child node always gets the .background style class and
the popover itself gets the .menu style class if the popover is
menu-like (i.e. `PopoverMenu`).

Particular uses of `Popover`, such as touch selection popups or magnifiers
in `Entry` or `TextView` get style classes like .touch-selection or .magnifier
to differentiate from plain popovers.

When styling a popover directly, the popover node should usually
not have any background.

Note that, in order to accomplish appropriate arrow visuals, `Popover` uses
custom drawing for the arrow node. This makes it possible for the arrow to
change its shape dynamically, but it also limits the possibilities of styling
it using CSS. In particular, the arrow gets drawn over the content node's
border so they look like one shape, which means that the border-width of
the content node and the arrow node should be the same. The arrow also does
not support any border shape other than solid, no border-radius, only one
border width (border-bottom-width is used) and no box-shadow.

<!-- struct PopoverMenu -->
`PopoverMenu` is a subclass of `Popover` that treats its
children like menus and allows switching between them. It
can open submenus as traditional, nested submenus, or in a
more touch-friendly sliding fashion.

`PopoverMenu` is meant to be used primarily with menu models,
using `PopoverMenu::new_from_model`. If you need to put other
widgets such as `SpinButton` or `Switch` into a popover,
use a plain `Popover`.

## Menu models

The XML format understood by `Builder` for `gio::MenuModel` consists
of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
same content model as `<menu>`. Instead of `<link name="submenu>` or
`<link name="section">`, you can use `<submenu>` or `<section>`
elements.


```text<!--language: xml -->
<menu id='app-menu'>
  <section>
    <item>
      <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_New Window</attribute>
      <attribute name='action'>app.new</attribute>
    </item>
    <item>
      <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_About Sunny</attribute>
      <attribute name='action'>app.about</attribute>
    </item>
    <item>
      <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_Quit</attribute>
      <attribute name='action'>app.quit</attribute>
    </item>
  </section>
</menu>
```

Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other `Builder`
content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
`translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
To make use of this, the `Builder` must have been given the gettext
domain to use.

The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:
- "label": a user-visible string to display
- "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
- "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
- "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
- "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to determine
 if a submenu can be opened
- "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
 Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".
 This is mainly useful for exported menus, see `GtkApplicationExt::set_menubar`.
- "custom": a string used to match against the ID of a custom child added
 with `PopoverMenu::add_child`, `PopoverMenuBar::add_child`, or
 in the ui file with `<child type="ID">`.

The following attributes are used when constructing sections:
- "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
- "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
 Possible values include "horizontal-buttons", "circular-buttons" and "inline-buttons". They all indicate that section should be
 displayed as a horizontal row of buttons.
- "text-direction": a string used to determine the `TextDirection` to use
 when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
 include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".

The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:
- "label": a user-visible string to display
- "icon": icon name to display

Menu items will also show accelerators, which are usually associated
with actions via `GtkApplicationExt::set_accels_for_action`,
`WidgetClass::add_binding_action` or `ShortcutController::add_shortcut`.

# CSS Nodes

`PopoverMenu` is just a subclass of `Popover` that adds
custom content to it, therefore it has the same CSS nodes.
It is one of the cases that add a .menu style class to
the popover's main node.

# Accessibility

`PopoverMenu` uses the `AccessibleRole::Menu` role, and its
items use the `AccessibleRole::MenuItem`, `AccessibleRole::MenuItemCheckbox` or `AccessibleRole::MenuItemRadio` roles, depending on the
action they are connected to.

# Implements

[`PopoverExt`](trait.PopoverExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`NativeExt`](trait.NativeExt.html), [`ShortcutManagerExt`](trait.ShortcutManagerExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl PopoverMenu::fn new_from_model -->
Creates a `PopoverMenu` and populates it according to
`model`.

The created buttons are connected to actions found in the
`ApplicationWindow` to which the popover belongs - typically
by means of being attached to a widget that is contained within
the ``GtkApplicationWindows`` widget hierarchy.

Actions can also be added using `WidgetExt::insert_action_group`
on the menus attach widget or on any of its parent widgets.

This function creates menus with sliding submenus.
See `PopoverMenu::new_from_model_full` for a way
to control this.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`

# Returns

the new `PopoverMenu`
<!-- impl PopoverMenu::fn new_from_model_full -->
Creates a `PopoverMenu` and populates it according to
`model`.

The created buttons are connected to actions found in the
action groups that are accessible from the parent widget.
This includes the `ApplicationWindow` to which the popover
belongs. Actions can also be added using `WidgetExt::insert_action_group`
on the parent widget or on any of its parent widgets.

The only flag that is supported currently is
`PopoverMenuFlags::Nested`, which makes GTK create traditional,
nested submenus instead of the default sliding submenus.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`
## `flags`
flags that affect how the menu is created

# Returns

the new `PopoverMenu`
<!-- impl PopoverMenu::fn add_child -->

`true` if the widget was removed
<!-- impl PopoverMenu::fn set_menu_model -->
Sets a new menu model on `self`.

The existing contents of `self` are removed, and
the `self` is populated with new contents according
to `model`.
## `model`
a `gio::MenuModel`, or `None`
<!-- struct PopoverMenuBar -->
`PopoverMenuBar` presents a horizontal bar of items that pop
up popover menus when clicked.

The only way to create instances of `PopoverMenuBar` is
from a `gio::MenuModel`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
menubar
├── item[.active]
┊   ╰── popover
╰── item
    ╰── popover
```

`PopoverMenuBar` has a single CSS node with name menubar, below which
each item has its CSS node, and below that the corresponding popover.

The item whose popover is currently open gets the .active
style class.

# Accessibility

`PopoverMenuBar` uses the `AccessibleRole::MenuBar` role,
the menu items use the `AccessibleRole::MenuItem` role and
the menus use the `AccessibleRole::Menu` role.

<!-- struct PrintContext -->
A `PrintContext` encapsulates context information that is required when
drawing pages for printing, such as the cairo context and important
parameters like page size and resolution. It also lets you easily
create `pango::Layout` and `pango::Context` objects that match the font metrics
of the cairo surface.

`PrintContext` objects gets passed to the `PrintOperation::begin-print`,
`PrintOperation::end-print`, `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals on the `PrintOperation`.

## Using `PrintContext` in a `PrintOperation::draw-page` callback

`PrintOperation` is the high-level, portable printing API.
It looks a bit different than other GTK dialogs such as the
`FileChooser`, since some platforms don’t expose enough
infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such
platforms, `PrintOperation` uses the native print dialog.
On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK
uses its own, see ``GtkPrintUnixDialog``.

The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create
a `PrintOperation` object with `PrintOperation::new` when
the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it,
e.g. the page size, any `PrintSettings` from previous print
operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.

Then you start the print operation by calling `PrintOperationExt::run`.
It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and
options. When the user finished the dialog various signals will
be emitted on the `PrintOperation`, the main one being
`PrintOperation::draw-page`, which you are supposed to catch
and render the page on the provided `PrintContext` using Cairo.

# The high-level printing API


```C
static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;

static void
do_print (void)
{
  GtkPrintOperation *print;
  GtkPrintOperationResult res;

  print = gtk_print_operation_new ();

  if (settings != NULL)
    gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);

  g_signal_connect (print, "begin_print", G_CALLBACK (begin_print), NULL);
  g_signal_connect (print, "draw_page", G_CALLBACK (draw_page), NULL);

  res = gtk_print_operation_run (print, GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                                 GTK_WINDOW (main_window), NULL);

  if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY)
    {
      if (settings != NULL)
        g_object_unref (settings);
      settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
    }

  g_object_unref (print);
}
```

By default `PrintOperation` uses an external application to do
print preview. To implement a custom print preview, an application
must connect to the preview signal. The functions
`PrintOperationPreview::render_page`,
`PrintOperationPreview::end_preview` and
`PrintOperationPreview::is_selected`
are useful when implementing a print preview.

# Implements

[`PrintOperationExt`](trait.PrintOperationExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`PrintOperationPreviewExt`](trait.PrintOperationPreviewExt.html)
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt -->
Trait containing all `PrintOperation` methods.

# Implementors

[`PrintOperation`](struct.PrintOperation.html)
<!-- impl PrintOperation::fn new -->
Creates a new `PrintOperation`.

# Returns

a new `PrintOperation`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn cancel -->
Cancels a running print operation. This function may
be called from a `PrintOperation::begin-print`,
`PrintOperation::paginate` or `PrintOperation::draw-page`
signal handler to stop the currently running print
operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn draw_page_finish -->
Signalize that drawing of particular page is complete.

It is called after completion of page drawing (e.g. drawing in another
thread).
If `PrintOperationExt::set_defer_drawing` was called before, then this function
has to be called by application. In another case it is called by the library
itself.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_default_page_setup -->
Returns the default page setup, see
`PrintOperationExt::set_default_page_setup`.

# Returns

the default page setup
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_embed_page_setup -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:embed-page-setup` property.

# Returns

whether page setup selection combos are embedded
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_error -->
Call this when the result of a print operation is
`PrintOperationResult::Error`, either as returned by
`PrintOperationExt::run`, or in the `PrintOperation::done` signal
handler. The returned `glib::Error` will contain more details on what went wrong.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_has_selection -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:has-selection` property.

# Returns

whether there is a selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_n_pages_to_print -->
Returns the number of pages that will be printed.

Note that this value is set during print preparation phase
(`PrintStatus::Preparing`), so this function should never be
called before the data generation phase (`PrintStatus::GeneratingData`).
You can connect to the `PrintOperation::status-changed` signal
and call `PrintOperationExt::get_n_pages_to_print` when
print status is `PrintStatus::GeneratingData`.
This is typically used to track the progress of print operation.

# Returns

the number of pages that will be printed
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_print_settings -->
Returns the current print settings.

Note that the return value is `None` until either
`PrintOperationExt::set_print_settings` or
`PrintOperationExt::run` have been called.

# Returns

the current print settings of `self`.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_status -->
Returns the status of the print operation.
Also see `PrintOperationExt::get_status_string`.

# Returns

the status of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_status_string -->
Returns a string representation of the status of the
print operation. The string is translated and suitable
for displaying the print status e.g. in a `Statusbar`.

Use `PrintOperationExt::get_status` to obtain a status
value that is suitable for programmatic use.

# Returns

a string representation of the status
 of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_support_selection -->
Gets the value of `PrintOperation:support-selection` property.

# Returns

whether the application supports print of selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn is_finished -->
A convenience function to find out if the print operation
is finished, either successfully (`PrintStatus::Finished`)
or unsuccessfully (`PrintStatus::FinishedAborted`).

Note: when you enable print status tracking the print operation
can be in a non-finished state even after done has been called, as
the operation status then tracks the print job status on the printer.

# Returns

`true`, if the print operation is finished.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn run -->
Runs the print operation, by first letting the user modify
print settings in the print dialog, and then print the document.

Normally that this function does not return until the rendering of all
pages is complete. You can connect to the
`PrintOperation::status-changed` signal on `self` to obtain some
information about the progress of the print operation.
Furthermore, it may use a recursive mainloop to show the print dialog.

If you call `PrintOperationExt::set_allow_async` or set the
`PrintOperation:allow-async` property the operation will run
asynchronously if this is supported on the platform. The
`PrintOperation::done` signal will be emitted with the result of the
operation when the it is done (i.e. when the dialog is canceled, or when
the print succeeds or fails).

```C
if (settings != NULL)
  gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);
  
if (page_setup != NULL)
  gtk_print_operation_set_default_page_setup (print, page_setup);
  
g_signal_connect (print, "begin-print",
                  G_CALLBACK (begin_print), &data);
g_signal_connect (print, "draw-page",
                  G_CALLBACK (draw_page), &data);
 
res = gtk_print_operation_run (print,
                               GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                               parent,
                               &error);
 
if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_ERROR)
 {
   error_dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (GTK_WINDOW (parent),
                                   GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
                         GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                         GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                         "Error printing file:\n%s",
                         error->message);
   g_signal_connect (error_dialog, "response",
                     G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy), NULL);
   gtk_widget_show (error_dialog);
   g_error_free (error);
 }
else if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY)
 {
   if (settings != NULL)
g_object_unref (settings);
   settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
 }
```

Note that `PrintOperationExt::run` can only be called once on a
given `PrintOperation`.
## `action`
the action to start
## `parent`
Transient parent of the dialog

# Returns

the result of the print operation. A return value of
 `PrintOperationResult::Apply` indicates that the printing was
 completed successfully. In this case, it is a good idea to obtain
 the used print settings with `PrintOperationExt::get_print_settings`
 and store them for reuse with the next print operation. A value of
 `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` means the operation is running
 asynchronously, and will emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when
 done.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_allow_async -->
Sets whether the `PrintOperationExt::run` may return
before the print operation is completed. Note that
some platforms may not allow asynchronous operation.
## `allow_async`
`true` to allow asynchronous operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_current_page -->
Sets the current page.

If this is called before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
## `current_page`
the current page, 0-based
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_custom_tab_label -->
Sets the label for the tab holding custom widgets.
## `label`
the label to use, or `None` to use the default label
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_default_page_setup -->
Makes `default_page_setup` the default page setup for `self`.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,
but it can be overridden on a per-page basis by connecting
to the `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` signal.
## `default_page_setup`
a `PageSetup`, or `None`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_defer_drawing -->
Sets up the `PrintOperation` to wait for calling of
`PrintOperationExt::draw_page_finish` from application. It can
be used for drawing page in another thread.

This function must be called in the callback of “draw-page” signal.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_embed_page_setup -->
Embed page size combo box and orientation combo box into page setup page.
Selected page setup is stored as default page setup in `PrintOperation`.
## `embed`
`true` to embed page setup selection in the ``GtkPrintUnixDialog``
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_export_filename -->
Sets up the `PrintOperation` to generate a file instead
of showing the print dialog. The intended use of this function
is for implementing “Export to PDF” actions. Currently, PDF
is the only supported format.

“Print to PDF” support is independent of this and is done
by letting the user pick the “Print to PDF” item from the list
of printers in the print dialog.
## `filename`
the filename for the exported file
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_has_selection -->
Sets whether there is a selection to print.

Application has to set number of pages to which the selection
will draw by `PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages` in a callback of
`PrintOperation::begin-print`.
## `has_selection`
`true` indicates that a selection exists
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_job_name -->
Sets the name of the print job. The name is used to identify
the job (e.g. in monitoring applications like eggcups).

If you don’t set a job name, GTK picks a default one by
numbering successive print jobs.
## `job_name`
a string that identifies the print job
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_n_pages -->
Sets the number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal handler.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup`
and `PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
## `n_pages`
the number of pages
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_print_settings -->
Sets the print settings for `self`. This is typically used to
re-establish print settings from a previous print operation,
see `PrintOperationExt::run`.
## `print_settings`
`PrintSettings`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_show_progress -->
If `show_progress` is `true`, the print operation will show a
progress dialog during the print operation.
## `show_progress`
`true` to show a progress dialog
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_support_selection -->
Sets whether selection is supported by `PrintOperation`.
## `support_selection`
`true` to support selection
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_track_print_status -->
If track_status is `true`, the print operation will try to continue report
on the status of the print job in the printer queues and printer. This
can allow your application to show things like “out of paper” issues,
and when the print job actually reaches the printer.

This function is often implemented using some form of polling, so it should
not be enabled unless needed.
## `track_status`
`true` to track status after printing
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_unit -->
Sets up the transformation for the cairo context obtained from
`PrintContext` in such a way that distances are measured in
units of `unit`.
## `unit`
the unit to use
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_use_full_page -->
If `full_page` is `true`, the transformation for the cairo context
obtained from `PrintContext` puts the origin at the top left
corner of the page (which may not be the top left corner of the
sheet, depending on page orientation and the number of pages per
sheet). Otherwise, the origin is at the top left corner of the
imageable area (i.e. inside the margins).
## `full_page`
`true` to set up the `PrintContext` for the full page
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_begin_print -->
Emitted after the user has finished changing print settings
in the dialog, before the actual rendering starts.

A typical use for ::begin-print is to use the parameters from the
`PrintContext` and paginate the document accordingly, and then
set the number of pages with `PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages`.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_create_custom_widget -->
Emitted when displaying the print dialog. If you return a
widget in a handler for this signal it will be added to a custom
tab in the print dialog. You typically return a container widget
with multiple widgets in it.

The print dialog owns the returned widget, and its lifetime is not
controlled by the application. However, the widget is guaranteed
to stay around until the `PrintOperation::custom-widget-apply`
signal is emitted on the operation. Then you can read out any
information you need from the widgets.

# Returns

A custom widget that gets embedded in
 the print dialog, or `None`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_custom_widget_apply -->
Emitted right before `PrintOperation::begin-print` if you added
a custom widget in the `PrintOperation::create-custom-widget` handler.
When you get this signal you should read the information from the
custom widgets, as the widgets are not guaraneed to be around at a
later time.
## `widget`
the custom widget added in create-custom-widget
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_done -->
Emitted when the print operation run has finished doing
everything required for printing.

`result` gives you information about what happened during the run.
If `result` is `PrintOperationResult::Error` then you can call
`PrintOperationExt::get_error` for more information.

If you enabled print status tracking then
`PrintOperationExt::is_finished` may still return `false`
after `PrintOperation::done` was emitted.
## `result`
the result of the print operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_draw_page -->
Emitted for every page that is printed. The signal handler
must render the `page_nr`'s page onto the cairo context obtained
from `context` using `PrintContext::get_cairo_context`.

```C
static void
draw_page (GtkPrintOperation *operation,
           GtkPrintContext   *context,
           int                page_nr,
           gpointer           user_data)
{
  cairo_t *cr;
  PangoLayout *layout;
  double width, text_height;
  int layout_height;
  PangoFontDescription *desc;
  
  cr = gtk_print_context_get_cairo_context (context);
  width = gtk_print_context_get_width (context);
  
  cairo_rectangle (cr, 0, 0, width, HEADER_HEIGHT);
  
  cairo_set_source_rgb (cr, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8);
  cairo_fill (cr);
  
  layout = gtk_print_context_create_pango_layout (context);
  
  desc = pango_font_description_from_string ("sans 14");
  pango_layout_set_font_description (layout, desc);
  pango_font_description_free (desc);
  
  pango_layout_set_text (layout, "some text", -1);
  pango_layout_set_width (layout, width * PANGO_SCALE);
  pango_layout_set_alignment (layout, PANGO_ALIGN_CENTER);
                   
  pango_layout_get_size (layout, NULL, &layout_height);
  text_height = (double)layout_height / PANGO_SCALE;
  
  cairo_move_to (cr, width / 2,  (HEADER_HEIGHT - text_height) / 2);
  pango_cairo_show_layout (cr, layout);
  
  g_object_unref (layout);
}
```

Use `PrintOperationExt::set_use_full_page` and
`PrintOperationExt::set_unit` before starting the print operation
to set up the transformation of the cairo context according to your
needs.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
## `page_nr`
the number of the currently printed page (0-based)
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_end_print -->
Emitted after all pages have been rendered.
A handler for this signal can clean up any resources that have
been allocated in the `PrintOperation::begin-print` handler.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_paginate -->
Emitted after the `PrintOperation::begin-print` signal, but before
the actual rendering starts. It keeps getting emitted until a connected
signal handler returns `true`.

The ::paginate signal is intended to be used for paginating a document
in small chunks, to avoid blocking the user interface for a long
time. The signal handler should update the number of pages using
`PrintOperationExt::set_n_pages`, and return `true` if the document
has been completely paginated.

If you don't need to do pagination in chunks, you can simply do
it all in the ::begin-print handler, and set the number of pages
from there.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation

# Returns

`true` if pagination is complete
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_preview -->
Gets emitted when a preview is requested from the native dialog.

The default handler for this signal uses an external viewer
application to preview.

To implement a custom print preview, an application must return
`true` from its handler for this signal. In order to use the
provided `context` for the preview implementation, it must be
given a suitable cairo context with `PrintContext::set_cairo_context`.

The custom preview implementation can use
`PrintOperationPreview::is_selected` and
`PrintOperationPreview::render_page` to find pages which
are selected for print and render them. The preview must be
finished by calling `PrintOperationPreview::end_preview`
(typically in response to the user clicking a close button).
## `preview`
the `PrintOperationPreview` for the current operation
## `context`
the `PrintContext` that will be used
## `parent`
the `Window` to use as window parent, or `None`

# Returns

`true` if the listener wants to take over control of the preview
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_request_page_setup -->
Emitted once for every page that is printed, to give
the application a chance to modify the page setup. Any changes
done to `setup` will be in force only for printing this page.
## `context`
the `PrintContext` for the current operation
## `page_nr`
the number of the currently printed page (0-based)
## `setup`
the `PageSetup`
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_status_changed -->
Emitted at between the various phases of the print operation.
See `PrintStatus` for the phases that are being discriminated.
Use `PrintOperationExt::get_status` to find out the current
status.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn connect_update_custom_widget -->
Emitted after change of selected printer. The actual page setup and
print settings are passed to the custom widget, which can actualize
itself according to this change.
## `widget`
the custom widget added in create-custom-widget
## `setup`
actual page setup
## `settings`
actual print settings
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_allow_async -->
Determines whether the print operation may run asynchronously or not.

Some systems don't support asynchronous printing, but those that do
will return `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` as the status, and
emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when the operation is actually
done.

The Windows port does not support asynchronous operation at all (this
is unlikely to change). On other platforms, all actions except for
`PrintOperationAction::Export` support asynchronous operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_allow_async -->
Determines whether the print operation may run asynchronously or not.

Some systems don't support asynchronous printing, but those that do
will return `PrintOperationResult::InProgress` as the status, and
emit the `PrintOperation::done` signal when the operation is actually
done.

The Windows port does not support asynchronous operation at all (this
is unlikely to change). On other platforms, all actions except for
`PrintOperationAction::Export` support asynchronous operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_current_page -->
The current page in the document.

If this is set before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_current_page -->
The current page in the document.

If this is set before `PrintOperationExt::run`,
the user will be able to select to print only the current page.

Note that this only makes sense for pre-paginated documents.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_custom_tab_label -->
Used as the label of the tab containing custom widgets.
Note that this property may be ignored on some platforms.

If this is `None`, GTK uses a default label.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_custom_tab_label -->
Used as the label of the tab containing custom widgets.
Note that this property may be ignored on some platforms.

If this is `None`, GTK uses a default label.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_default_page_setup -->
The `PageSetup` used by default.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,
but it can be overridden on a per-page basis by connecting
to the `PrintOperation::request-page-setup` signal.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_default_page_setup -->
The `PageSetup` used by default.

This page setup will be used by `PrintOperationExt::run`,

<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_n_pages -->
The number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal handler.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_n_pages -->
The number of pages in the document.

This must be set to a positive number
before the rendering starts. It may be set in a
`PrintOperation::begin-print` signal handler.

Note that the page numbers passed to the
`PrintOperation::request-page-setup` and
`PrintOperation::draw-page` signals are 0-based, i.e. if
the user chooses to print all pages, the last ::draw-page signal
will be for page `n_pages` - 1.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_n_pages_to_print -->
The number of pages that will be printed.

Note that this value is set during print preparation phase
(`PrintStatus::Preparing`), so this value should never be
get before the data generation phase (`PrintStatus::GeneratingData`).
You can connect to the `PrintOperation::status-changed` signal
and call `PrintOperationExt::get_n_pages_to_print` when
print status is `PrintStatus::GeneratingData`.
This is typically used to track the progress of print operation.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_print_settings -->

If `true`, the print operation will support print of selection.
This allows the print dialog to show a "Selection" button.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_support_selection -->
If `true`, the print operation will support print of selection.
This allows the print dialog to show a "Selection" button.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn get_property_track_print_status -->
If `true`, the print operation will try to continue report on
the status of the print job in the printer queues and printer.
This can allow your application to show things like “out of paper”
issues, and when the print job actually reaches the printer.
However, this is often implemented using polling, and should
not be enabled unless needed.
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_track_print_status -->

from `PrintContext` puts the origin at the top left corner
of the page (which may not be the top left corner of the sheet,
depending on page orientation and the number of pages per sheet).
Otherwise, the origin is at the top left corner of the imageable
area (i.e. inside the margins).
<!-- trait PrintOperationExt::fn set_property_use_full_page -->

<!-- trait PrintOperationPreviewExt::fn connect_got_page_size -->
The ::got-page-size signal is emitted once for each page
that gets rendered to the preview.

according to `page_setup` and set up a suitable cairo
context, using `PrintContext::set_cairo_context`.
## `context`
the current `PrintContext`
## `page_setup`
the `PageSetup` for the current page
<!-- trait PrintOperationPreviewExt::fn connect_ready -->
The ::ready signal gets emitted once per preview operation,
before the first page is rendered.

A handler for this signal can be used for setup tasks.

<!-- struct PrintSettings -->
A `PrintSettings` object represents the settings of a print dialog in
a system-independent way. The main use for this object is that once
you’ve printed you can get a settings object that represents the settings
the user chose, and the next time you print you can pass that object in so
that the user doesn’t have to re-set all his settings.

Its also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can easily save
the settings for the next time your app runs, or even store them in a
document. The predefined keys try to use shared values as much as possible
so that moving such a document between systems still works.

 signal is emitted and during pagination.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant GeneratingData -->
This status is set while the
 pages are being rendered.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant SendingData -->
The print job is being sent off to the
 printer.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Pending -->
The print job has been sent to the printer,
 but is not printed for some reason, e.g. the printer may be stopped.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant PendingIssue -->
Some problem has occurred during
 printing, e.g. a paper jam.
<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant Printing -->

<!-- enum PrintStatus::variant FinishedAborted -->
The printing has been aborted.
<!-- struct ProgressBar -->
The `ProgressBar` is typically used to display the progress of a long
running operation. It provides a visual clue that processing is underway.
The `ProgressBar` can be used in two different modes: percentage mode
and activity mode.

When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
(e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
progress, it can use the `ProgressBar` in percentage mode and the
user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
`ProgressBar::set_fraction` periodically to update the progress bar.

When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
to do, it can use the `ProgressBar` in activity mode, which shows
activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
this mode, the application is required to call `ProgressBar::pulse`
periodically to update the progress bar.

There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
of the `ProgressBar`. Functions are provided to control the orientation
of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
step size used in activity mode can be set.

# CSS nodes


```plain
progressbar[.osd]
├── [text]
╰── trough[.empty][.full]
    ╰── progress[.pulse]
```

`ProgressBar` has a main CSS node with name progressbar and subnodes with
names text and trough, of which the latter has a subnode named progress. The
text subnode is only present if text is shown. The progress subnode has the
style class .pulse when in activity mode. It gets the style classes .left,
.right, .top or .bottom added when the progress 'touches' the corresponding
end of the `ProgressBar`. The .osd class on the progressbar node is for use
in overlays like the one Epiphany has for page loading progress.

# Accessibility

`ProgressBar` uses the `AccessibleRole::ProgressBar` role.

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `ProgressBar::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the progress bar is inverted
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_pulse_step -->
Retrieves the pulse step set with `ProgressBar::set_pulse_step`.

# Returns

a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_show_text -->
Gets the value of the `ProgressBar:show-text` property.
See `ProgressBar::set_show_text`.

# Returns

`true` if text is shown in the progress bar
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_text -->
Retrieves the text that is displayed with the progress bar,
if any, otherwise `None`. The return value is a reference
to the text, not a copy of it, so will become invalid
if you change the text in the progress bar.

# Returns

text, or `None`; this string is owned by the widget
and should not be modified or freed.
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn pulse -->
Indicates that some progress has been made, but you don’t know how much.
Causes the progress bar to enter “activity mode,” where a block
bounces back and forth. Each call to `ProgressBar::pulse`
causes the block to move by a little bit (the amount of movement
per pulse is determined by `ProgressBar::set_pulse_step`).
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_ellipsize -->
Sets the mode used to ellipsize (add an ellipsis: "...") the
text if there is not enough space to render the entire string.
## `mode`
a `pango::EllipsizeMode`
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_fraction -->
Causes the progress bar to “fill in” the given fraction
of the bar. The fraction should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusive.
## `fraction`
fraction of the task that’s been completed
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_inverted -->
Progress bars normally grow from top to bottom or left to right.
Inverted progress bars grow in the opposite direction.
## `inverted`
`true` to invert the progress bar
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_pulse_step -->
Sets the fraction of total progress bar length to move the
bouncing block for each call to `ProgressBar::pulse`.
## `fraction`
fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show text next to the bar.
The shown text is either the value of the `ProgressBar:text`
property or, if that is `None`, the `ProgressBar:fraction` value,
as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for containing
text (even if the actual text is blank), set `ProgressBar:show-text` to
`true` and `ProgressBar:text` to the empty string (not `None`).
## `show_text`
whether to show text
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_text -->
Causes the given `text` to appear next to the progress bar.

If `text` is `None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the current
value of `ProgressBar:fraction` will be displayed as a percentage.

If `text` is non-`None` and `ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`, the text
will be displayed. In this case, it will not display the progress
percentage. If `text` is the empty string, the progress bar will still
be styled and sized suitably for containing text, as long as
`ProgressBar:show-text` is `true`.
## `text`
a UTF-8 string, or `None`
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the progress bar does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the progress bar requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis ("..."). Another means to set a
progress bar's width is `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_property_ellipsize -->
The preferred place to ellipsize the string, if the progress bar does
not have enough room to display the entire string, specified as a
`pango::EllipsizeMode`.

Note that setting this property to a value other than
`pango::EllipsizeMode::None` has the side-effect that the progress bar requests
only enough space to display the ellipsis ("..."). Another means to set a
progress bar's width is `WidgetExt::set_size_request`.
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn get_property_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show a text in addition
to the bar itself. The shown text is either the value of
the `ProgressBar:text` property or, if that is `None`,
the `ProgressBar:fraction` value, as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for
showing text (even if the actual text is blank), set
`ProgressBar:show-text` to `true` and `ProgressBar:text`
to the empty string (not `None`).
<!-- impl ProgressBar::fn set_property_show_text -->
Sets whether the progress bar will show a text in addition
to the bar itself. The shown text is either the value of
the `ProgressBar:text` property or, if that is `None`,
the `ProgressBar:fraction` value, as a percentage.

To make a progress bar that is styled and sized suitably for
showing text (even if the actual text is blank), set
`ProgressBar:show-text` to `true` and `ProgressBar:text`
to the empty string (not `None`).
<!-- enum PropagationLimit -->
Describes limits of a `EventController` for handling events
targeting other widgets.
<!-- enum PropagationLimit::variant None -->
Events are handled regardless of what their
 target is.
<!-- enum PropagationLimit::variant SameNative -->
Events are only handled if their target
 is in the same `Native` as the event controllers widget. Note
 that some event types have two targets (origin and destination).
<!-- enum PropagationPhase -->
Describes the stage at which events are fed into a `EventController`.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant None -->
Events are not delivered.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Capture -->
Events are delivered in the capture phase. The
 capture phase happens before the bubble phase, runs from the toplevel down
 to the event widget. This option should only be used on containers that
 might possibly handle events before their children do.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Bubble -->
Events are delivered in the bubble phase. The bubble
 phase happens after the capture phase, and before the default handlers
 are run. This phase runs from the event widget, up to the toplevel.
<!-- enum PropagationPhase::variant Target -->
Events are delivered in the default widget event handlers,
 note that widget implementations must chain up on button, motion, touch and
 grab broken handlers for controllers in this phase to be run.
<!-- struct Range -->
`Range` is the common base class for widgets which visualize an
adjustment, e.g `Scale` or `Scrollbar`.

Apart from signals for monitoring the parameters of the adjustment,
`Range` provides properties and methods for setting a
“fill level” on range widgets. See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.

# Implements

[`RangeExt`](trait.RangeExt.html), [`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt -->
Trait containing all `Range` methods.

# Implementors

[`Range`](struct.Range.html), [`Scale`](struct.Scale.html)
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_adjustment -->
Get the `Adjustment` which is the “model” object for `Range`.
See `RangeExt::set_adjustment` for details.
The return value does not have a reference added, so should not
be unreferenced.

# Returns

a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_fill_level -->
Gets the current position of the fill level indicator.

# Returns

The current fill level
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_flippable -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_flippable`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_inverted -->
Gets the value set by `RangeExt::set_inverted`.

# Returns

`true` if the range is inverted
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_range_rect -->
This function returns the area that contains the range’s trough,
in coordinates relative to `self`'s origin.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `range_rect`
return location for the range rectangle
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range is restricted to the fill level.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is restricted to the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_round_digits -->
Gets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.

# Returns

the number of digits to round to
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_show_fill_level -->
Gets whether the range displays the fill level graphically.

# Returns

`true` if `self` shows the fill level.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_range -->
This function returns sliders range along the long dimension,
in widget->window coordinates.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `slider_start`
return location for the slider's
 start, or `None`
## `slider_end`
return location for the slider's
 end, or `None`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_slider_size_fixed -->
This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.

See `RangeExt::set_slider_size_fixed`.

# Returns

whether the range’s slider has a fixed size.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_value -->
Gets the current value of the range.

# Returns

current value of the range.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the adjustment to be used as the “model” object for this range
widget. The adjustment indicates the current range value, the
minimum and maximum range values, the step/page increments used
for keybindings and scrolling, and the page size. The page size
is normally 0 for `Scale` and nonzero for `Scrollbar`, and
indicates the size of the visible area of the widget being scrolled.
The page size affects the size of the scrollbar slider.
## `adjustment`
a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_fill_level -->
Set the new position of the fill level indicator.

The “fill level” is probably best described by its most prominent
use case, which is an indicator for the amount of pre-buffering in
a streaming media player. In that use case, the value of the range
would indicate the current play position, and the fill level would
be the position up to which the file/stream has been downloaded.

This amount of prebuffering can be displayed on the range’s trough
and is themeable separately from the trough. To enable fill level
display, use `RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`. The range defaults
to not showing the fill level.

Additionally, it’s possible to restrict the range’s slider position
to values which are smaller than the fill level. This is controller
by `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level` and is by default
enabled.
## `fill_level`
the new position of the fill level indicator
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_flippable -->
If a range is flippable, it will switch its direction if it is
horizontal and its direction is `TextDirection::Rtl`.

See `WidgetExt::get_direction`.
## `flippable`
`true` to make the range flippable
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_increments -->
Sets the step and page sizes for the range.
The step size is used when the user clicks the `Scrollbar`
arrows or moves `Scale` via arrow keys. The page size
is used for example when moving via Page Up or Page Down keys.
## `step`
step size
## `page`
page size
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_inverted -->
Ranges normally move from lower to higher values as the
slider moves from top to bottom or left to right. Inverted
ranges have higher values at the top or on the right rather than
on the bottom or left.
## `setting`
`true` to invert the range
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_range -->
Sets the allowable values in the `Range`, and clamps the range
value to be between `min` and `max`. (If the range has a non-zero
page size, it is clamped between `min` and `max` - page-size.)
## `min`
minimum range value
## `max`
maximum range value
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_restrict_to_fill_level -->
Sets whether the slider is restricted to the fill level. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `restrict_to_fill_level`
Whether the fill level restricts slider movement.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_round_digits -->
Sets the number of digits to round the value to when
it changes. See `Range::change-value`.
## `round_digits`
the precision in digits, or -1
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_show_fill_level -->
Sets whether a graphical fill level is show on the trough. See
`RangeExt::set_fill_level` for a general description of the fill
level concept.
## `show_fill_level`
Whether a fill level indicator graphics is shown.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_slider_size_fixed -->
Sets whether the range’s slider has a fixed size, or a size that
depends on its adjustment’s page size.

This function is useful mainly for `Range` subclasses.
## `size_fixed`
`true` to make the slider size constant
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the current value of the range; if the value is outside the
minimum or maximum range values, it will be clamped to fit inside
them. The range emits the `Range::value-changed` signal if the
value changes.
## `value`
new value of the range
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_adjust_bounds -->
Emitted before clamping a value, to give the application a
chance to adjust the bounds.
## `value`
the value before we clamp
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_change_value -->
The `Range::change-value` signal is emitted when a scroll action is
performed on a range. It allows an application to determine the
type of scroll event that occurred and the resultant new value.
The application can handle the event itself and return `true` to
prevent further processing. Or, by returning `false`, it can pass
the event to other handlers until the default GTK handler is
reached.

The value parameter is unrounded. An application that overrides
the `Range`::change-value signal is responsible for clamping the
value to the desired number of decimal digits; the default GTK
handler clamps the value based on `Range:round-digits`.
## `scroll`
the type of scroll action that was performed
## `value`
the new value resulting from the scroll action

# Returns

`true` to prevent other handlers from being invoked for
 the signal, `false` to propagate the signal further
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_move_slider -->
Virtual function that moves the slider. Used for keybindings.
## `step`
how to move the slider
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
Emitted when the range value changes.

The fill level (e.g. prebuffering of a network stream).
See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_property_fill_level -->
The fill level (e.g. prebuffering of a network stream).
See `RangeExt::set_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_property_restrict_to_fill_level -->
The restrict-to-fill-level property controls whether slider
movement is restricted to an upper boundary set by the
fill level. See `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_property_restrict_to_fill_level -->
The restrict-to-fill-level property controls whether slider
movement is restricted to an upper boundary set by the
fill level. See `RangeExt::set_restrict_to_fill_level`.

The number of digits to round the value to when
it changes, or -1. See `Range::change-value`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_property_round_digits -->
The number of digits to round the value to when
it changes, or -1. See `Range::change-value`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn get_property_show_fill_level -->
The show-fill-level property controls whether fill level indicator
graphics are displayed on the trough. See
`RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`.
<!-- trait RangeExt::fn set_property_show_fill_level -->
The show-fill-level property controls whether fill level indicator
graphics are displayed on the trough. See
`RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`.

<!-- struct RecentManager -->
`RecentManager` provides a facility for adding, removing and
looking up recently used files. Each recently used file is
identified by its URI, and has meta-data associated to it, like
the names and command lines of the applications that have
registered it, the number of time each application has registered
the same file, the mime type of the file and whether the file
should be displayed only by the applications that have
registered it.

The recently used files list is per user.

The `RecentManager` acts like a database of all the recently
used files. You can create new `RecentManager` objects, but
it is more efficient to use the default manager created by GTK

Adding a new recently used file is as simple as:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
gtk_recent_manager_add_item (manager, file_uri);
```

The `RecentManager` will try to gather all the needed information
from the file itself through GIO.

Looking up the meta-data associated with a recently used file
given its URI requires calling `RecentManagerExt::lookup_item`:


```C
GtkRecentManager *manager;
GtkRecentInfo *info;
GError *error = NULL;

manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
info = gtk_recent_manager_lookup_item (manager, file_uri, &error);
if (error)
  {
    g_warning ("Could not find the file: %s", error->message);
    g_error_free (error);
  }
else
 {
   // Use the info object
   gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
 }
```

In order to retrieve the list of recently used files, you can use
`RecentManagerExt::get_items`, which returns a list of `RecentInfo`.

A `RecentManager` is the model used to populate the contents of
one, or more ``GtkRecentChooser`` implementations.

Note that the maximum age of the recently used files list is
controllable through the `Settings:gtk-recent-files-max-age`
property.

# Implements

[`RecentManagerExt`](trait.RecentManagerExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt -->
Trait containing all `RecentManager` methods.

# Implementors

[`RecentManager`](struct.RecentManager.html)
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn new -->
Creates a new recent manager object. Recent manager objects are used to
handle the list of recently used resources. A `RecentManager` object
monitors the recently used resources list, and emits the “changed” signal
each time something inside the list changes.

`RecentManager` objects are expensive: be sure to create them only when
needed. You should use `RecentManager::get_default` instead.

# Returns

A newly created `RecentManager` object
<!-- impl RecentManager::fn get_default -->
Gets a unique instance of `RecentManager`, that you can share
in your application without caring about memory management.

# Returns

A unique `RecentManager`. Do not ref or
 unref it.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn add_full -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list, using the metadata specified inside the
`RecentData` passed in `recent_data`.

The passed URI will be used to identify this resource inside the
list.

In order to register the new recently used resource, metadata about
the resource must be passed as well as the URI; the metadata is
stored in a `RecentData`, which must contain the MIME
type of the resource pointed by the URI; the name of the application
that is registering the item, and a command line to be used when
launching the item.

Optionally, a `RecentData` might contain a UTF-8 string
to be used when viewing the item instead of the last component of
the URI; a short description of the item; whether the item should
be considered private - that is, should be displayed only by the
applications that have registered it.
## `uri`
a valid URI
## `recent_data`
metadata of the resource

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added to the
 recently used resources list, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn add_item -->
Adds a new resource, pointed by `uri`, into the recently used
resources list.

This function automatically retrieves some of the needed
metadata and setting other metadata to common default values;
it then feeds the data to `RecentManagerExt::add_full`.

See `RecentManagerExt::add_full` if you want to explicitly
define the metadata for the resource pointed by `uri`.
## `uri`
a valid URI

# Returns

`true` if the new item was successfully added
 to the recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn get_items -->
Gets the list of recently used resources.

# Returns

a list of
 newly allocated `RecentInfo` objects. Use
 `RecentInfo::unref` on each item inside the list, and then
 free the list itself using `glib::List::free`.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn has_item -->
Checks whether there is a recently used resource registered
with `uri` inside the recent manager.
## `uri`
a URI

# Returns

`true` if the resource was found, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn lookup_item -->
Searches for a URI inside the recently used resources list, and
returns a `RecentInfo` containing information about the resource
like its MIME type, or its display name.
## `uri`
a URI

# Returns

a `RecentInfo` containing information
 about the resource pointed by `uri`, or `None` if the URI was
 not registered in the recently used resources list. Free with
 `RecentInfo::unref`.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn move_item -->
Changes the location of a recently used resource from `uri` to `new_uri`.

Please note that this function will not affect the resource pointed
by the URIs, but only the URI used in the recently used resources list.
## `uri`
the URI of a recently used resource
## `new_uri`
the new URI of the recently used resource, or
 `None` to remove the item pointed by `uri` in the list

# Returns

`true` on success
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn purge_items -->
Purges every item from the recently used resources list.

# Returns

the number of items that have been removed from the
 recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn remove_item -->
Removes a resource pointed by `uri` from the recently used resources
list handled by a recent manager.
## `uri`
the URI of the item you wish to remove

# Returns

`true` if the item pointed by `uri` has been successfully
 removed by the recently used resources list, and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted when the current recently used resources manager changes
its contents, either by calling `RecentManagerExt::add_item` or
by another application.
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn get_property_filename -->
The full path to the file to be used to store and read the
recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn set_property_filename -->
The full path to the file to be used to store and read the
recently used resources list
<!-- trait RecentManagerExt::fn get_property_size -->
The size of the recently used resources list.
<!-- enum RecentManagerError -->
Error codes for `RecentManager` operations
<!-- enum RecentManagerError::variant NotFound -->
the URI specified does not exists in
 the recently used resources list.

<!-- struct Revealer -->
The `Revealer` widget is a container which animates
the transition of its child from invisible to visible.

The style of transition can be controlled with
`Revealer::set_transition_type`.

These animations respect the `Settings:gtk-enable-animations`
setting.

# CSS nodes

`Revealer` has a single CSS node with name revealer.
When styling `Revealer` using CSS, remember that it only hides its contents,
not itself. That means applied margin, padding and borders will be
visible even when the `Revealer:reveal-child` property is set to `false`.

# Accessibility

`Revealer` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.

The child of `Revealer`, if set, is always available in the accessibility
tree, regardless of the state of the revealer widget.

<!-- struct Root -->
`Root` is the interface implemented by all widgets that can act as a toplevel
widget to a hierarchy of widgets. The root widget takes care of providing the
connection to the windowing system and manages layout, drawing and event delivery
for its widget hierarchy.

The obvious example of a `Root` is `Window`.

# Implements

<!-- trait RootExt::fn get_display -->
Returns the display that this `Root` is on.

# Returns

the display of `root`
<!-- trait RootExt::fn get_focus -->
Retrieves the current focused widget within the root.

Note that this is the widget that would have the focus
if the root is active; if the root is not focused then
`gtk_widget_has_focus (widget)` will be `false` for the
widget.

# Returns

the currently focused widget,
 or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait RootExt::fn set_focus -->
If `focus` is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets
it as the focus widget for the root. If `focus` is `None`, unsets
the focus widget for the root.

To set the focus to a particular widget in the root, it is usually
more convenient to use `WidgetExt::grab_focus` instead of this function.
## `focus`
widget to be the new focus widget, or `None`
 to unset the focus widget
<!-- struct Scale -->
A `Scale` is a slider control used to select a numeric value.
To use it, you’ll probably want to investigate the methods on
its base class, `Range`, in addition to the methods for `Scale` itself.
To set the value of a scale, you would normally use `RangeExt::set_value`.
To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the
`Range::value-changed` signal.

Note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the `Scale` (through
the `Range` methods) will hide the slider itself. This is useful for
applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale, without
changing the layout of the application (such as movie or music players).

# `Scale` as `Buildable`

`Scale` supports a custom `<marks>` element, which can contain multiple
`<mark>` elements. The “value” and “position” attributes have the same
meaning as `ScaleExt::add_mark` parameters of the same name. If the
element is not empty, its content is taken as the markup to show at
the mark. It can be translated with the usual ”translatable” and
“context” attributes.

# CSS nodes


```plain
scale[.fine-tune][.marks-before][.marks-after]
├── [value][.top][.right][.bottom][.left]
├── marks.top
│   ├── mark
│   ┊    ├── [label]
│   ┊    ╰── indicator
┊   ┊
│   ╰── mark
├── marks.bottom
│   ├── mark
│   ┊    ├── indicator
│   ┊    ╰── [label]
┊   ┊
│   ╰── mark
╰── trough
    ├── [fill]
    ├── [highlight]
    ╰── slider
```

`Scale` has a main CSS node with name scale and a subnode for its contents,
with subnodes named trough and slider.

The main node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scale is in
'fine-tuning' mode.

If the scale has an origin (see `ScaleExt::set_has_origin`), there is a
subnode with name highlight below the trough node that is used for rendering
the highlighted part of the trough.

If the scale is showing a fill level (see `RangeExt::set_show_fill_level`),
there is a subnode with name fill below the trough node that is used for
rendering the filled in part of the trough.

If marks are present, there is a marks subnode before or after the trough
node, below which each mark gets a node with name mark. The marks nodes get
either the .top or .bottom style class.

The mark node has a subnode named indicator. If the mark has text, it also
has a subnode named label. When the mark is either above or left of the
scale, the label subnode is the first when present. Otherwise, the indicator
subnode is the first.

The main CSS node gets the 'marks-before' and/or 'marks-after' style classes
added depending on what marks are present.

If the scale is displaying the value (see `Scale:draw-value`), there is
subnode with name value. This node will get the .top or .bottom style classes
similar to the marks node.

# Accessibility

`Scale` uses the `AccessibleRole::Slider` role.

<!-- trait ScaleExt -->
Trait containing all `Scale` methods.

# Implementors

[`Scale`](struct.Scale.html)
<!-- impl Scale::fn new -->
Creates a new `Scale`.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `adjustment`
the `Adjustment` which sets the range
 of the scale, or `None` to create a new adjustment.

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- impl Scale::fn new_with_range -->
Creates a new scale widget with the given orientation that lets the
user input a number between `min` and `max` (including `min` and `max`)
with the increment `step`. `step` must be nonzero; it’s the distance
the slider moves when using the arrow keys to adjust the scale
value.

Note that the way in which the precision is derived works best if `step`
is a power of ten. If the resulting precision is not suitable for your
needs, use `ScaleExt::set_digits` to correct it.
## `orientation`
the scale’s orientation.
## `min`
minimum value
## `max`
maximum value
## `step`
step increment (tick size) used with keyboard shortcuts

# Returns

a new `Scale`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn add_mark -->
Adds a mark at `value`.

A mark is indicated visually by drawing a tick mark next to the scale,
and GTK makes it easy for the user to position the scale exactly at the
marks value.

If `markup` is not `None`, text is shown next to the tick mark.

To remove marks from a scale, use `ScaleExt::clear_marks`.
## `value`
the value at which the mark is placed, must be between
 the lower and upper limits of the scales’ adjustment
## `position`
where to draw the mark. For a horizontal scale, `PositionType::Top`
 and `PositionType::Left` are drawn above the scale, anything else below.
 For a vertical scale, `PositionType::Left` and `PositionType::Top` are drawn to
 the left of the scale, anything else to the right.
## `markup`
Text to be shown at the mark, using [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat], or `None`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn clear_marks -->
Removes any marks that have been added with `ScaleExt::add_mark`.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_digits -->
Gets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value.

# Returns

the number of decimal places that are displayed
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_draw_value -->
Returns whether the current value is displayed as a string
next to the slider.

# Returns

whether the current value is displayed as a string
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_has_origin -->
Returns whether the scale has an origin.

# Returns

`true` if the scale has an origin.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_layout -->
Gets the `pango::Layout` used to display the scale. The returned
object is owned by the scale so does not need to be freed by
the caller.

# Returns

the `pango::Layout` for this scale,
 or `None` if the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`.
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_layout_offsets -->
Obtains the coordinates where the scale will draw the
`pango::Layout` representing the text in the scale. Remember
when using the `pango::Layout` function you need to convert to
and from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS() or `PANGO_SCALE`.

If the `Scale:draw-value` property is `false`, the return
values are undefined.
## `x`
location to store X offset of layout, or `None`
## `y`
location to store Y offset of layout, or `None`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn get_value_pos -->
Gets the position in which the current value is displayed.

# Returns

the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_digits -->
Sets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value. Also
causes the value of the adjustment to be rounded to this number of digits,
so the retrieved value matches the displayed one, if `Scale:draw-value` is
`true` when the value changes. If you want to enforce rounding the value when
`Scale:draw-value` is `false`, you can set `Range:round-digits` instead.

Note that rounding to a small number of digits can interfere with
the smooth autoscrolling that is built into `Scale`. As an alternative,
you can use `ScaleExt::set_format_value_func` to format the displayed
value yourself.
## `digits`
the number of decimal places to display,
 e.g. use 1 to display 1.0, 2 to display 1.00, etc
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_draw_value -->
Specifies whether the current value is displayed as a string next
to the slider.
## `draw_value`
`true` to draw the value
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_format_value_func -->
`func` allows you to change how the scale value is displayed. The given
function will return an allocated string representing `value`.
That string will then be used to display the scale's value.

If `None` is passed as `func`, the value will be displayed on
its own, rounded according to the value of the `Scale:digits` property.
## `func`
function that formats the value
## `user_data`
user data to pass to `func`
## `destroy_notify`
destroy function for `user_data`
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_has_origin -->
If `Scale:has-origin` is set to `true` (the default), the scale will
highlight the part of the trough between the origin (bottom or left side)
and the current value.
## `has_origin`
`true` if the scale has an origin
<!-- trait ScaleExt::fn set_value_pos -->
Sets the position in which the current value is displayed.
## `pos`
the position in which the current value is displayed
<!-- struct ScaleButton -->
`ScaleButton` provides a button which pops up a scale widget.
This kind of widget is commonly used for volume controls in multimedia
applications, and GTK provides a `VolumeButton` subclass that
is tailored for this use case.

# CSS nodes

`ScaleButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .scale style class.

## `step`
the stepping of value when a scroll-wheel event,
 or up/down arrow event occurs (usually 2)
## `icons`

<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn set_adjustment -->
Sets the `Adjustment` to be used as a model
for the `ScaleButton`’s scale.
See `RangeExt::set_adjustment` for details.
## `adjustment`
a `Adjustment`
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn set_icons -->
Sets the icons to be used by the scale button.
For details, see the `ScaleButton:icons` property.
## `icons`
a `None`-terminated array of icon names
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the current value of the scale; if the value is outside
the minimum or maximum range values, it will be clamped to fit
inside them. The scale button emits the `ScaleButton::value-changed`
signal if the value changes.
## `value`
new value of the scale button
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn connect_popdown -->
The ::popdown signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to popdown the scale widget.

The default binding for this signal is Escape.
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn connect_popup -->
The ::popup signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to popup the scale widget.

The default bindings for this signal are Space, Enter and Return.

The ::value-changed signal is emitted when the value field has
changed.
## `value`
the new value
<!-- trait ScaleButtonExt::fn get_property_icons -->
The names of the icons to be used by the scale button.
The first item in the array will be used in the button
when the current value is the lowest value, the second
item for the highest value. All the subsequent icons will
be used for all the other values, spread evenly over the
range of values.

If there's only one icon name in the `icons` array, it will
be used for all the values. If only two icon names are in
the `icons` array, the first one will be used for the bottom
50% of the scale, and the second one for the top 50%.

It is recommended to use at least 3 icons so that the
`ScaleButton` reflects the current value of the scale
better for the users.

<!-- struct Scrollable -->
`Scrollable` is an interface that is implemented by widgets with native
scrolling ability.

To implement this interface you should override the
`Scrollable:hadjustment` and `Scrollable:vadjustment` properties.

## Creating a scrollable widget

All scrollable widgets should do the following.

- When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
 the widget should populate the adjustments’
 `Adjustment:lower`, `Adjustment:upper`,
 `Adjustment:step-increment`, `Adjustment:page-increment` and
 `Adjustment:page-size` properties and connect to the
 `Adjustment::value-changed` signal.

- Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
 the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
 This means that it must accept any value passed to its
 `WidgetClass.size_allocate`() function.

- When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
 the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.

- When any of the adjustments emits the `Adjustment::value-changed` signal,
 the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.

The `Scrollbar` widget is a horizontal or vertical scrollbar,
depending on the value of the `Orientable:orientation` property.

Its position and movement are controlled by the adjustment that is passed to
or created by `Scrollbar::new`. See `Adjustment` for more details. The
`Adjustment:value` field sets the position of the thumb and must be between
`Adjustment:lower` and `Adjustment:upper` - `Adjustment:page-size`. The
`Adjustment:page-size` represents the size of the visible scrollable area.
The fields `Adjustment:step-increment` and `Adjustment:page-increment`
fields are added to or subtracted from the `Adjustment:value` when the user
asks to move by a step (using e.g. the cursor arrow keys) or by a page (using
e.g. the Page Down/Up keys).

# CSS nodes


```plain

`Scrollbar` has a main CSS node with name scrollbar and a subnode for its
contents. The main node gets the .horizontal or .vertical
style classes applied, depending on the scrollbar's orientation.

The range node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scrollbar is
in 'fine-tuning' mode.

Other style classes that may be added to scrollbars inside `ScrolledWindow`
include the positional classes (.left, .right, .top, .bottom) and style
classes related to overlay scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering).

<!-- impl Scrollbar::fn new -->

# Returns

the new `Scrollbar`.
<!-- impl Scrollbar::fn get_adjustment -->

<!-- struct ScrolledWindow -->
`ScrolledWindow` is a container that accepts a single child widget, makes
that child scrollable using either internally added scrollbars or externally
associated adjustments, and optionally draws a frame around the child.

Widgets with native scrolling support, i.e. those whose classes implement the
`Scrollable` interface, are added directly. For other types of widget, the
class `Viewport` acts as an adaptor, giving scrollability to other widgets.
`ScrolledWindow::set_child` intelligently
accounts for whether or not the added child is a `Scrollable`. If it isn’t,
`ScrolledWindow` wraps the child in a `Viewport` and adds that for you.
Therefore, you can just add any child widget and not worry about the details.

If `ScrolledWindow::set_child` has added a `Viewport` for you, you can remove
both your added child widget from the `Viewport`, and the `Viewport`
from the `ScrolledWindow`, like this:


```C
GtkWidget *scrolled_window = gtk_scrolled_window_new ();
GtkWidget *child_widget = gtk_button_new ();

// GtkButton is not a GtkScrollable, so GtkScrolledWindow will automatically
// add a GtkViewport.
gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (scrolled_window),
                   child_widget);

// Either of these will result in child_widget being unparented:
gtk_box_remove (GTK_BOX (scrolled_window),
                      child_widget);
// or
gtk_box_remove (GTK_BOX (scrolled_window),
                      gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (scrolled_window)));
```

Unless `ScrolledWindow:hscrollbar-policy` and `ScrolledWindow:vscrollbar-policy`
are GTK_POLICY_NEVER or GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL,
`ScrolledWindow` adds internal `Scrollbar` widgets around its child. The
scroll position of the child, and if applicable the scrollbars, is controlled
by the `ScrolledWindow:hadjustment` and `ScrolledWindow:vadjustment`
that are associated with the `ScrolledWindow`. See the docs on `Scrollbar`
for the details, but note that the “step_increment” and “page_increment”
fields are only effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.

If a `ScrolledWindow` doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
your own scrolling with `Scrollbar` and for example a `Grid`.

# Touch support

`ScrolledWindow` has built-in support for touch devices. When a
touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
`ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling` property if it is undesired.

`ScrolledWindow` also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
captured with the `ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.

If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlaid as
narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
can be turned off with the `ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling`
property.

# CSS nodes

`ScrolledWindow` has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
It gets a .frame style class added when `ScrolledWindow:has-frame`
is `true`.

It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to
draw the overflow and underflow indications. These nodes get
the .left, .right, .top or .bottom style class added depending
on where the indication is drawn.

`ScrolledWindow` also sets the positional style classes (.left,
.right, .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay
scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.

If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
with a subnode named junction.

<!-- impl ScrolledWindow::fn connect_edge_overshot -->
The ::edge-overshot signal is emitted whenever user initiated scrolling
makes the scrolled window firmly surpass (i.e. with some edge resistance)
the lower or upper limits defined by the adjustment in that orientation.

A similar behavior without edge resistance is provided by the
`ScrolledWindow::edge-reached` signal.

Note: The `pos` argument is LTR/RTL aware, so callers should be aware too
if intending to provide behavior on horizontal edges.
## `pos`
edge side that was hit
<!-- impl ScrolledWindow::fn connect_edge_reached -->
The ::edge-reached signal is emitted whenever user-initiated scrolling
makes the scrolled window exactly reach the lower or upper limits
defined by the adjustment in that orientation.

A similar behavior with edge resistance is provided by the
`ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.

Note: The `pos` argument is LTR/RTL aware, so callers should be aware too
if intending to provide behavior on horizontal edges.
## `pos`

<!-- impl ScrolledWindow::fn connect_move_focus_out -->
The ::move-focus-out signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`] which gets
emitted when focus is moved away from the scrolled window by a
keybinding. The `Widget::move-focus` signal is emitted with
`direction_type` on this scrolled window’s toplevel parent in the
container hierarchy. The default bindings for this signal are
`Ctrl + Tab` to move forward and `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` to move backward.

<!-- struct SearchBar -->
`SearchBar` is a container made to have a search entry (possibly
with additional connex widgets, such as drop-down menus, or buttons)
built-in. The search bar would appear when a search is started through
typing on the keyboard, or the application’s search mode is toggled on.

For keyboard presses to start a search, the search bar must be told
of a widget to capture key events from through
`SearchBar::set_key_capture_widget`. This widget will typically
be the top-level window, or a parent container of the search bar. Common
shortcuts such as Ctrl+F should be handled as an application action, or
through the menu items.

You will also need to tell the search bar about which entry you
are using as your search entry using `SearchBar::connect_entry`.
The following example shows you how to create a more complex search
entry.

# CSS nodes


```plain
searchbar
╰── revealer
    ╰── box
         ├── [child]
         ╰── [button.close]
```

`SearchBar` has a main CSS node with name searchbar. It has a child node
with name revealer that contains a node with name box. The box node contains both the
CSS node of the child widget as well as an optional button node which gets the .close
style class applied.

<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_child -->
Sets the child widget of `self`.
## `child`
the child widget
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_key_capture_widget -->
Sets `widget` as the widget that `self` will capture key events from.

If key events are handled by the search bar, the bar will
be shown, and the entry populated with the entered text.
## `widget`
a `Widget`
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_search_mode -->
Switches the search mode on or off.
## `search_mode`
the new state of the search mode
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_show_close_button -->
Shows or hides the close button. Applications that
already have a “search” toggle button should not show a close
button in their search bar, as it duplicates the role of the
toggle button.
## `visible`
whether the close button will be shown or not
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn get_property_search_mode_enabled -->
Whether the search mode is on and the search bar shown.

See `SearchBar::set_search_mode` for details.
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_property_search_mode_enabled -->
Whether the search mode is on and the search bar shown.

See `SearchBar::set_search_mode` for details.
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn get_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to show the close button in the search bar.
<!-- impl SearchBar::fn set_property_show_close_button -->
Whether to show the close button in the search bar.
<!-- struct SearchEntry -->
`SearchEntry` is an entry widget that has been tailored for use
as a search entry. The main aPI for interacting with a `SearchEntry`
as entry is the `Editable` interface.

It will show an inactive symbolic “find” icon when the search
entry is empty, and a symbolic “clear” icon when there is text.
Clicking on the “clear” icon will empty the search entry.

To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to
not react to every change in the entry text immediately, but
only after a short delay. To support this, `SearchEntry`
emits the `SearchEntry::search-changed` signal which can
be used instead of the `Editable::changed` signal.

The `SearchEntry::previous-match`, `SearchEntry::next-match`
and `SearchEntry::stop-search` signals can be used to implement
moving between search results and ending the search.

Often, `SearchEntry` will be fed events by means of being
placed inside a `SearchBar`. If that is not the case,
you can use `SearchEntry::set_key_capture_widget` to let it
capture key input from another widget.

# CSS Nodes


```plain
entry.search
╰── text
```

`SearchEntry` has a single CSS node with name entry that carries
a .sarch style class, and the text node is a child of that.

# Accessibility

`SearchEntry` uses the `AccessibleRole::SearchBox` role.

empty, and a clear icon when it isn't.

# Returns

a new `SearchEntry`
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn get_key_capture_widget -->
Gets the widget that `self` is capturing key events from.

# Returns

The key capture widget.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn set_key_capture_widget -->
Sets `widget` as the widget that `self` will capture key events from.

Key events are consumed by the search entry to start or
continue a search.

If the entry is part of a `SearchBar`, it is preferable
to call `SearchBar::set_key_capture_widget` instead, which
will reveal the entry in addition to triggering the search entry.
## `widget`
a `Widget`
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal is forwarded from the
`Text::activated` signal, which is a keybinding
signal for all forms of the Enter key.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_next_match -->
The ::next-match signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a move to the next match
for the current search string.

Applications should connect to it, to implement moving between
matches.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-g.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_previous_match -->
The ::previous-match signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a move to the previous match
for the current search string.

Applications should connect to it, to implement moving between
matches.

The default bindings for this signal is Ctrl-Shift-g.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_search_changed -->
The `SearchEntry::search-changed` signal is emitted with a short
delay of 150 milliseconds after the last change to the entry text.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_search_started -->
The ::search-started signal gets emitted when the user initiated
a search on the entry.
<!-- impl SearchEntry::fn connect_stop_search -->
The ::stop-search signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user stops a search via keyboard input.

Applications should connect to it, to implement hiding the search
entry in this case.

The default bindings for this signal is Escape.
<!-- struct SelectionFilterModel -->
`SelectionFilterModel` is a list model that presents the
selected items in a `SelectionModel` as its own list model.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- impl SelectionFilterModel::fn new -->
Creates a new `SelectionFilterModel` that will include the
selected items from the underlying selection model.
## `model`
the selection model to filter, or `None`

# Returns

a new `SelectionFilterModel`
<!-- impl SelectionFilterModel::fn get_model -->
Gets the model currently filtered or `None` if none.

# Returns

The model that gets filtered
<!-- impl SelectionFilterModel::fn set_model -->
Sets the model to be filtered.

Note that GTK makes no effort to ensure that `model` conforms to
the item type of `self`. It assumes that the caller knows what they
are doing and have set up an appropriate filter to ensure that item
types match.
## `model`
The model to be filtered
<!-- impl SelectionFilterModel::fn get_property_model -->
The model being filtered
<!-- impl SelectionFilterModel::fn set_property_model -->
The model being filtered
<!-- enum SelectionMode -->
Used to control what selections users are allowed to make.
<!-- enum SelectionMode::variant None -->
No selection is possible.
<!-- enum SelectionMode::variant Single -->
Zero or one element may be selected.
<!-- enum SelectionMode::variant Browse -->
Exactly one element is selected.
 In some circumstances, such as initially or during a search
 operation, it’s possible for no element to be selected with
 `SelectionMode::Browse`. What is really enforced is that the user
 can’t deselect a currently selected element except by selecting
 another element.
<!-- enum SelectionMode::variant Multiple -->
Any number of elements may be selected.
 The Ctrl key may be used to enlarge the selection, and Shift
 key to select between the focus and the child pointed to.
 Some widgets may also allow Click-drag to select a range of elements.
<!-- struct SelectionModel -->
`SelectionModel` is an interface that extends the `gio::ListModel` interface by
adding support for selections. This support is then used by widgets using list
models to add the ability to select and unselect various items.

GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
as `SingleSelection`, so you will only need to implement this interface if
you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.

A `SelectionModel` supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item
is selected or not. This can be queried via `SelectionModel::is_selected`.
When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
`SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal by calling the
`SelectionModel::selection_changed` function. The positions given in that
signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a requirement.
If new items added to the model via the `gio::ListModel::items-changed` signal are
selected or not is up to the implementation.

Note that items added via `gio::ListModel::items-changed` may already be selected
and no `SelectionModel::selection-changed` will be emitted for them. So to
track which items are selected, it is necessary to listen to both signals.

Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
to select and unselect items. However, ``GtkSelectionModels`` are free to only
implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
support the unimplemented operations.

When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
selecting is not supported by the model.

Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.

[`SelectionModelExt`](trait.SelectionModelExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt -->
Trait containing all `SelectionModel` methods.

# Implementors

[`MultiSelection`](struct.MultiSelection.html), [`NoSelection`](struct.NoSelection.html), [`SelectionModel`](struct.SelectionModel.html), [`SingleSelection`](struct.SingleSelection.html)
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn get_selection -->
Gets the set containing all currently selected items in the model.

This function may be slow, so if you are only interested in single item,
consider using `SelectionModel::is_selected` or if you are only
interested in a few consider `SelectionModel::get_selection_in_range`.

# Returns

a `Bitset` containing all the values currently
 selected in `self`. If no items are selected, the bitset is empty.
 The bitset must not be modified.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn get_selection_in_range -->
Gets a set containing a set where the values in the range `[position,
position + n_items)` match the selected state of the items in that range.
All values outside that range are undefined.

This function is an optimization for `SelectionModel::get_selection` when
you are only interested in part of the model's selected state. A common use
case is in response to the `SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal.
## `position`
start of the queired range
## `n_items`
number of items in the queried range

# Returns

A `Bitset` that matches the selection state for the given state
 with all other values being undefined.
 The bitset must not be modified.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn is_selected -->
Checks if the given item is selected.
## `position`
the position of the item to query

# Returns

`true` if the item is selected
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_all -->
Requests to select all items in the model.

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean that all items are now selected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_item -->
Requests to select an item in the model.
## `position`
the position of the item to select
## `unselect_rest`
whether previously selected items should be unselected

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean the item was selected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn select_range -->
Requests to select a range of items in the model.
## `position`
the first item to select
## `n_items`
the number of items to select
## `unselect_rest`
whether previously selected items should be unselected

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean the range was selected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn selection_changed -->
Helper function for implementations of `SelectionModel`.
Call this when a the selection changes to emit the
`SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal.
## `position`
the first changed item
## `n_items`
the number of changed items
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn set_selection -->
This is the most advanced selection updating method that allows
the most fine-grained control over selection changes.
If you can, you should try the simpler versions, as implementations
are more likely to implement support for those.

Requests that the selection state of all positions set in `mask` be
updated to the respective value in the `selected` bitmask.

In pseudocode, it would look something like this:


```C
for (i = 0; i < n_items; i++)
  {
    // don't change values not in the mask
    if (!gtk_bitset_contains (mask, i))
      continue;

    if (gtk_bitset_contains (selected, i))
      select_item (i);
    else
      unselect_item (i);
  }

gtk_selection_model_selection_changed (model, first_changed_item, n_changed_items);
```

`mask` and `selected` must not be modified. They may refer to the same bitset,
which would mean that every item in the set should be selected.
## `selected`
bitmask specifying if items should be selected or
 unselected
## `mask`
bitmask specifying which items should be updated

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean that all items were updated according
 to the inputs.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_all -->
Requests to unselect all items in the model.

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean that all items are now unselected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_item -->
Requests to unselect an item in the model.
## `position`
the position of the item to unselect

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean the item was unselected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn unselect_range -->
Requests to unselect a range of items in the model.
## `position`
the first item to unselect
## `n_items`
the number of items to unselect

# Returns

`true` if this action was supported and no fallback should be
 tried. This does not mean the range was unselected.
<!-- trait SelectionModelExt::fn connect_selection_changed -->
Emitted when the selection state of some of the items in `model` changes.

Note that this signal does not specify the new selection state of the items,
they need to be queried manually.
It is also not necessary for a model to change the selection state of any of
the items in the selection model, though it would be rather useless to emit
such a signal.
## `position`
The first item that may have changed
## `n_items`
number of items with changes
<!-- enum SensitivityType -->
Determines how GTK handles the sensitivity of various controls,
such as combo box buttons.
<!-- enum SensitivityType::variant Auto -->
The control is made insensitive if no
 action can be triggered
<!-- enum SensitivityType::variant On -->
The control is always sensitive
<!-- enum SensitivityType::variant Off -->
The control is always insensitive
<!-- struct Separator -->
`Separator` is a horizontal or vertical separator widget, depending on the
value of the `Orientable:orientation` property, used to group the widgets
within a window. It displays a line with a shadow to make it appear sunken
into the interface.

# CSS nodes

`Separator` has a single CSS node with name separator. The node
gets one of the .horizontal or .vertical style classes.

# Accessibility

`Separator` uses the `AccessibleRole::Separator` role.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`OrientableExt`](trait.OrientableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl Separator::fn new -->
Creates a new `Separator` with the given orientation.
## `orientation`
the separator’s orientation.

# Returns

a new `Separator`.
<!-- struct Settings -->
`Settings` provide a mechanism to share global settings between
applications.

On the X window system, this sharing is realized by an
[XSettings](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec)
manager that is usually part of the desktop environment, along with
utilities that let the user change these settings.

On Wayland, the settings are obtained either via a settings portal,
or by reading desktop settings from DConf.

In the absence of these sharing mechanisms, GTK reads default values for
settings from `settings.ini` files in `/etc/gtk-4.0`, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gtk-4.0`
and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0`. These files must be valid key files (see
`glib::KeyFile`), and have a section called Settings. Themes can also provide
default values for settings by installing a `settings.ini` file
next to their `gtk.css` file.

Applications can override system-wide settings by setting the property
of the `Settings` object with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`. This should be restricted
to special cases though; `Settings` are not meant as an application
configuration facility.

There is one `Settings` instance per display. It can be obtained with
`Settings::get_for_display`, but in many cases, it is more convenient
to use `WidgetExt::get_settings`.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`StyleProviderExt`](trait.StyleProviderExt.html)
<!-- impl Settings::fn get_default -->
Gets the `Settings` object for the default display, creating
it if necessary. See `Settings::get_for_display`.

# Returns

a `Settings` object. If there is
no default display, then returns `None`.
<!-- impl Settings::fn get_for_display -->
Gets the `Settings` object for `display`, creating it if necessary.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`.

# Returns

a `Settings` object.
<!-- impl Settings::fn reset_property -->
Undoes the effect of calling `gobject::ObjectExt::set` to install an
application-specific value for a setting. After this call,
the setting will again follow the session-wide value for
this setting.
## `name`
the name of the setting to reset
<!-- impl Settings::fn get_property_gtk_alternative_sort_arrows -->
Controls the direction of the sort indicators in sorted list and tree
views. By default an arrow pointing down means the column is sorted
in ascending order. When set to `true`, this order will be inverted.
<!-- impl Settings::fn set_property_gtk_alternative_sort_arrows -->
Controls the direction of the sort indicators in sorted list and tree
views. By default an arrow pointing down means the column is sorted
in ascending order. When set to `true`, this order will be inverted.
<!-- impl Settings::fn get_property_gtk_application_prefer_dark_theme -->
Whether the application prefers to use a dark theme. If a GTK theme
includes a dark variant, it will be used instead of the configured
theme.

Some applications benefit from minimizing the amount of light pollution that
interferes with the content. Good candidates for dark themes are photo and
video editors that make the actual content get all the attention and minimize
the distraction of the chrome.

Dark themes should not be used for documents, where large spaces are white/light
and the dark chrome creates too much contrast (web browser, text editor...).

<!-- impl Settings::fn get_property_gtk_decoration_layout -->
This setting determines which buttons should be put in the
titlebar of client-side decorated windows, and whether they
should be placed at the left of right.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close, icon (the window icon) and menu (a menu button
for the fallback app menu).

For example, "menu:minimize,maximize,close" specifies a menu
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.

Note that buttons will only be shown when they are meaningful.
E.g. a menu button only appears when the desktop shell does not
show the app menu, and a close button only appears on a window
that can be closed.

Also note that the setting can be overridden with the
`HeaderBar:decoration-layout` property.

<!-- struct Shortcut -->
`Shortcut` is the low level object used for managing keyboard
shortcuts.

It contains a description of how to trigger the shortcut via a
`ShortcutTrigger` and a way to activate the shortcut on a widget
via `ShortcutAction`.

The actual work is usually done via `ShortcutController`, which
decides if and when to activate a shortcut. Using that controller
directly however is rarely necessary as various higher level
convenience APIs exist on ``GtkWidgets`` that make it easier to use
shortcuts in GTK.

`Shortcut` does provide functionality to make it easy for users
to work with shortcuts, either by providing informational strings
for display purposes or by allowing shortcuts to be configured.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Shortcut::fn new -->

<!-- impl Shortcut::fn set_property_trigger -->
The trigger that triggers this shortcut.
<!-- struct ShortcutAction -->
`ShortcutAction` is the object used to describe what a `Shortcut` should
do when triggered. To activate a `ShortcutAction` manually,
`ShortcutActionExt::activate` can be called.

``GtkShortcutActions`` contain functions that allow easy presentation to end
users as well as being printed for debugging.

All ``GtkShortcutActions`` are immutable, you can only specify their properties
during construction. If you want to change a action, you have to replace it
with a new one. If you need to pass arguments to an action, these are specified
by the higher-level `Shortcut` object.

GTK provides various actions:

 - `MnemonicAction`: a shortcut action that calls `WidgetExt::mnemonic_activate`
 - `CallbackAction`: a shortcut action that invokes a given callback
 - `SignalAction`: a shortcut action that emits a given signal
 - `ActivateAction`: a shortcut action that calls `WidgetExt::activate`
 - `NamedAction`: a shortcut action that calls `WidgetExt::activate_action`
 - `NothingAction`: a shortcut action that does nothing

Note that some actions ignore the passed in `flags`, `widget` or `args`.

Activation of an action can fail for various reasons. If the action
is not supported by the `widget`, if the `args` don't match the action
or if the activation otherwise had no effect, `false` will be returned.
## `flags`
flags to activate with
## `widget`
Target of the activation
## `args`
arguments to pass

# Returns

`true` if this action was activated successfully
<!-- trait ShortcutActionExt::fn print -->
Prints the given action into a string for the developer.
This is meant for debugging and logging.

The form of the representation may change at any time and is
not guaranteed to stay identical.
## `string`
a `glib::String` to print into
<!-- trait ShortcutActionExt::fn to_string -->
Prints the given action into a human-readable string.
This is a small wrapper around `ShortcutActionExt::print` to help
when debugging.

# Returns

a new string
<!-- struct ShortcutActionFlags -->
List of flags that can be passed to action activation.
More flags may be added in the future.
<!-- struct ShortcutActionFlags::const EXCLUSIVE -->
The action is the only
 action that can be activated. If this flag is not set,
 a future activation may select a different action.
<!-- struct ShortcutController -->
`ShortcutController` is an event controller that manages shortcuts.

Most common shortcuts are using this controller implicitly, e.g. by
adding a mnemonic underline to a `Label`, or by installing a key
binding using `WidgetClass::add_binding`, or by adding accelerators
to global actions using `GtkApplicationExt::set_accels_for_action`.

But it is possible to create your own shortcut controller, and add
shortcuts to it.

`ShortcutController` implements `gio::ListModel` for querying the shortcuts that
have been added to it.

# `ShortcutController` as a `Buildable`

`GtkShortcutControllers` can be creates in ui files to set up shortcuts
in the same place as the widgets.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `ShortcutController`:

```text
  <object class='GtkButton'>
    <child>
      <object class='GtkShortcutController'>
        <property name='scope'>managed</property>
        <child>
          <object class='GtkShortcut'>
            <property name='trigger'>&amp;lt;Control&amp;gt;k</property>
            <property name='action'>activate</property>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
```

This example creates a `ActivateAction` for triggering the `activate`
signal of the `Button`. See `ShortcutAction::parse_string` for the syntax
for other kinds of `ShortcutAction`. See `ShortcutTrigger::parse_string`
to learn more about the syntax for triggers.

<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn new -->
Creates a new shortcut controller.

# Returns

a newly created shortcut controller
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn new_for_model -->
Creates a new shortcut controller that takes its shortcuts from
the given list model.

A controller created by this function does not let you add or
remove individual shortcuts using the shortcut controller api,
but you can change the contents of the model.
## `model`
a `gio::ListModel` containing shortcuts

# Returns

a newly created shortcut controller
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn add_shortcut -->
Adds `shortcut` to the list of shortcuts handled by `self`.

If this controller uses an external shortcut list, this
function does nothing.
## `shortcut`
a `Shortcut`
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn get_mnemonics_modifiers -->
Gets the mnemonics modifiers for when this controller activates its shortcuts. See
`ShortcutController::set_mnemonics_modifiers` for details.

# Returns

the controller's mnemonics modifiers
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn get_scope -->
Gets the scope for when this controller activates its shortcuts. See
`ShortcutController::set_scope` for details.

# Returns

the controller's scope
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn remove_shortcut -->
Removes `shortcut` from the list of shortcuts handled by `self`.

If `shortcut` had not been added to `controller` or this controller
uses an external shortcut list, this function does nothing.
## `shortcut`
a `Shortcut`
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn set_mnemonics_modifiers -->
Sets the controller to have the given `mnemonics_modifiers`.

The mnemonics modifiers determines which modifiers need to be pressed to allow
activation of shortcuts with mnemonics triggers.

GTK normally uses the Alt modifier for mnemonics, except in ``GtkPopoverMenus``,
where mnemonics can be triggered without any modifiers. It should be very
rarely necessary to change this, and doing so is likely to interfere with
other shortcuts.

This value is only relevant for local shortcut controllers. Global and managed
shortcut controllers will have their shortcuts activated from other places which
have their own modifiers for activating mnemonics.
## `modifiers`
the new mnemonics_modifiers to use
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn set_scope -->
Sets the controller to have the given `scope`.

The scope allows shortcuts to be activated outside of the normal
event propagation. In particular, it allows installing global
keyboard shortcuts that can be activated even when a widget does
not have focus.

With `ShortcutScope::Local`, shortcuts will only be activated
when the widget has focus.
## `scope`
the new scope to use
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn get_property_mnemonic_modifiers -->
The modifiers that need to be pressed to allow mnemonics activation.
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn set_property_mnemonic_modifiers -->
The modifiers that need to be pressed to allow mnemonics activation.
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn set_property_model -->
A list model to take shortcuts from
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn get_property_scope -->
What scope the shortcuts will be handled in.
<!-- impl ShortcutController::fn set_property_scope -->
What scope the shortcuts will be handled in.
<!-- struct ShortcutLabel -->
`ShortcutLabel` is a widget that represents a single keyboard shortcut or gesture
in the user interface.

The text that is displayed when no accelerator is set.
<!-- struct ShortcutManager -->
The `ShortcutManager` interface is used to implement
shortcut scopes.

This is important for `Native` widgets that have their own surface,
since the event controllers that are used to implement managed and
global scopes are limited to the same native.

Examples for widgets implementing `ShortcutManager` are `Window`
and `Popover`.

``GtkShortcutTriggers`` contain functions that allow easy presentation to end
users as well as being printed for debugging.

All ``GtkShortcutTriggers`` are immutable, you can only specify their properties
during construction. If you want to change a trigger, you have to replace it
with a new one.

<!-- struct ShortcutsWindow -->
A `ShortcutsWindow` shows brief information about the keyboard shortcuts
and gestures of an application. The shortcuts can be grouped, and you can
have multiple sections in this window, corresponding to the major modes of
your application.

Additionally, the shortcuts can be filtered by the current view, to avoid
showing information that is not relevant in the current application context.

The recommended way to construct a `ShortcutsWindow` is with `Builder`,
by populating a `ShortcutsWindow` with one or more `ShortcutsSection`
objects, which contain ``GtkShortcutsGroups`` that in turn contain objects of
class `ShortcutsShortcut`.

# A simple example:

![](gedit-shortcuts.png)

This example has as single section. As you can see, the shortcut groups
are arranged in columns, and spread across several pages if there are too
many to find on a single page.

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-gedit.ui).

# An example with multiple views:

![](clocks-shortcuts.png)

This example shows a `ShortcutsWindow` that has been configured to show only
the shortcuts relevant to the "stopwatch" view.

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-clocks.ui).

# An example with multiple sections:

![](builder-shortcuts.png)

This example shows a `ShortcutsWindow` with two sections, "Editor Shortcuts"
and "Terminal Shortcuts".

The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-builder.ui).

Set this to `None` to show all groups.
<!-- impl ShortcutsWindow::fn set_property_view_name -->
The view name by which to filter the contents.

This should correspond to the `ShortcutsGroup:view` property of some of
the `ShortcutsGroup` objects that are inside this shortcuts window.

Set this to `None` to show all groups.
<!-- struct SignalAction -->
A `ShortcutAction` that emits a signal.

Signals that are used in this way are referred to as keybinding signals,
and they are expected to be defined with the `gobject::SignalFlags::Action` flag.

# Implements

[`ShortcutActionExt`](trait.ShortcutActionExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl SignalAction::fn new -->
Creates an action that when activated, emits the given action signal
on the provided widget unpacking the given args into arguments passed
to the signal.
## `signal_name`
name of the signal to emit

# Returns

a new `ShortcutAction`
<!-- impl SignalAction::fn get_signal_name -->
Returns the name of the signal that will be emitted.

# Returns

the name of the signal to emit
<!-- impl SignalAction::fn get_property_signal_name -->
The name of the signal to emit.
<!-- impl SignalAction::fn set_property_signal_name -->
The name of the signal to emit.
<!-- struct SignalListItemFactory -->
`SignalListItemFactory` is a `ListItemFactory` that provides signals
that user code can connect to to manage listitems.
Signals are emitted for every listitem in the same order:

 1. `SignalListItemFactory::setup` is emitted to set up permanent things
 on the listitem. This usually means constructing the widgets used in the
 row and adding them to the listitem.

 2. `SignalListItemFactory::bind` is emitted to bind the item passed via
 `ListItem:item` to the widgets that have been created in step 1 or to
 add item-specific widgets. Signals are connected to listen to changes -
 both to changes in the item to update the widgets or to changes in the
 widgets to update the item. After this signal has been called, the
 listitem may be shown in a list widget.

 3. `SignalListItemFactory::unbind` is emitted to undo everything done
 in step 2. Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers. Once this
 signal has been called, the listitem will no longer be used in a list
 widget.

 4. `SignalListItemFactory::bind` and `SignalListItemFactory::unbind`
 may be emitted multiple times again to bind the listitem for use with
 new items. By reusing listitems, potentially costly setup can be
 avoided. However, it means code needs to make sure to properly clean
 up the listitem in step 3 so that no information from the previous
 use leaks into the next use.

5. `SignalListItemFactory::teardown` is emitted to allow undoing the
effects of `SignalListItemFactory::setup`. After this signal was emitted
on a listitem, the listitem will be destroyed and not be used again.

Note that during the signal emissions, changing properties on the
``GtkListItems`` passed will not trigger notify signals as the listitem's
notifications are frozen. See `gobject::ObjectExt::freeze_notify` for details.

For tracking changes in other properties in the `ListItem`, the
`ListItem::notify` signal is recommended. The signal can be connected
in the `SignalListItemFactory::setup` signal and removed again during
`SignalListItemFactory::teardown`.

# Implements

[`ListItemFactoryExt`](trait.ListItemFactoryExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl SignalListItemFactory::fn new -->
Creates a new `SignalListItemFactory`. You need to connect signal
handlers before you use it.

# Returns

a new `SignalListItemFactory`
<!-- impl SignalListItemFactory::fn connect_bind -->
The ::bind signal is emitted when a new `ListItem:item` has been set
on the `listitem` and should be bound for use.

After this signal was emitted, the listitem might be shown in a `ListView`
or other list widget.

The `SignalListItemFactory::unbind` signal is the opposite of this signal
and can be used to undo everything done in this signal.
## `listitem`
The `ListItem` to bind
<!-- impl SignalListItemFactory::fn connect_setup -->
The ::setup signal is emitted when a new listitem has been created and
needs to be setup for use. It is the first signal emitted for every listitem.

The `SignalListItemFactory::teardown` signal is the opposite of this signal
and can be used to undo everything done in this signal.
## `listitem`
The `ListItem` to set up
<!-- impl SignalListItemFactory::fn connect_teardown -->
The ::teardown signal is emitted when a listitem is about to be destroyed.
It is the last signal ever emitted for this `listitem`.

This signal is the opposite of the `SignalListItemFactory::setup` signal
and should be used to undo everything done in that signal.
## `listitem`
The `ListItem` to teardown
<!-- impl SignalListItemFactory::fn connect_unbind -->
The ::unbind signal is emitted when a listitem has been removed from use
in a list widget and its new `ListItem:item` is about to be unset.

This signal is the opposite of the `SignalListItemFactory::bind` signal
and should be used to undo everything done in that signal.
## `listitem`
The `ListItem` to unbind
<!-- struct SingleSelection -->
`SingleSelection` is an implementation of the `SelectionModel` interface
that allows selecting a single element. It is the default selection method
used by list widgets in GTK.

Note that the selection is *persistent* -- if the selected item is removed
and re-added in the same `gio::ListModel::items-changed` emission, it stays selected.
In particular, this means that changing the sort order of an underlying sort
model will preserve the selection.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html), [`SelectionModelExt`](trait.SelectionModelExt.html)
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn new -->
Creates a new selection to handle `model`.
## `model`
the `gio::ListModel` to manage, or `None`

# Returns

a new `SingleSelection`
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_autoselect -->
Checks if autoselect has been enabled or disabled via
`SingleSelection::set_autoselect`.

# Returns

`true` if autoselect is enabled
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_can_unselect -->
If `true`, `SelectionModel::unselect_item` is supported and allows
unselecting the selected item.

# Returns

`true` to support unselecting
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_model -->
Gets the model that `self` is wrapping.

# Returns

The model being wrapped
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_selected -->
Gets the position of the selected item. If no item is selected,
`GTK_INVALID_LIST_POSITION` is returned.

# Returns

The position of the selected item
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_selected_item -->
Gets the selected item.

If no item is selected, `None` is returned.

# Returns

The selected item
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn set_autoselect -->
If `autoselect` is `true`, `self` will enforce that an item is always
selected. It will select a new item when the currently selected
item is deleted and it will disallow unselecting the current item.
## `autoselect`
`true` to always select an item
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn set_can_unselect -->
If `true`, unselecting the current item via
`SelectionModel::unselect_item` is supported.

Note that setting `SingleSelection:autoselect` will cause the
unselecting to not work, so it practically makes no sense to set
both at the same time the same time.
## `can_unselect`
`true` to allow unselecting
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn set_model -->
Sets the model that `self` should wrap. If `model` is `None`, `self`
will be empty.
## `model`
A `gio::ListModel` to wrap
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn set_selected -->
Selects the item at the given position.

If the list does not have an item at `position` or
`GTK_INVALID_LIST_POSITION` is given, the behavior depends on the
value of the `SingleSelection:autoselect` property: If it is set,
no change will occur and the old item will stay selected. If it is
unset, the selection will be unset and no item will be selected.
## `position`
the item to select or `GTK_INVALID_LIST_POSITION`
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn get_property_autoselect -->
If the selection will always select an item
<!-- impl SingleSelection::fn set_property_autoselect -->

<!-- struct SizeGroup -->
`SizeGroup` provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets
together so they all request the same amount of space. This is
typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same
size, but you can’t use a `Grid` widget.

In detail, the size requested for each widget in a `SizeGroup` is
the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
of the size group (see `SizeGroup::set_mode`) determines whether
this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.

Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
a `SizeGroup` to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
such a way that they get the size they request and not more. For
example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
include the `GTK_FILL` flag.

`SizeGroup` objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
so once you have added all widgets to a `SizeGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the size group with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. If the
widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
freed.

Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK will compute the
horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
of type `SizeGroupMode::Horizontal` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`, and the
vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
`SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`.

Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
trade height for width in mode `SizeGroupMode::Vertical` or `SizeGroupMode::Both`:
the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
width for height widgets.

Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum width
by way of `Label:width-chars` for instance. Widgets with static sizes as well
as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no such considerations.

# `SizeGroup` as `Buildable`

Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `SizeGroup`:

```text
<object class="GtkSizeGroup">
  <property name="mode">horizontal</property>
  <widgets>
    <widget name="radio1"/>
    <widget name="radio2"/>
  </widgets>
</object>
```

a newly created `SizeGroup`
<!-- impl SizeGroup::fn add_widget -->
Adds a widget to a `SizeGroup`. In the future, the requisition
of the widget will be determined as the maximum of its requisition
and the requisition of the other widgets in the size group.
Whether this applies horizontally, vertically, or in both directions
depends on the mode of the size group. See `SizeGroup::set_mode`.

When the widget is destroyed or no longer referenced elsewhere, it will
be removed from the size group.
## `widget`

all have the same vertical requisition (`SizeGroupMode::Vertical`),
or should all have the same requisition in both directions
(`SizeGroupMode::Both`).
## `mode`

<!-- enum SizeRequestMode::variant ConstantSize -->
Don’t trade height-for-width or width-for-height
<!-- struct SliceListModel -->

<!-- struct Snapshot -->
`Snapshot` is an auxiliary object that assists in creating `GskRenderNodes`
in the `gdk::PaintableInterface.snapshot`() vfunc. It functions in a similar way to
a cairo context, and maintains a stack of render nodes and their associated
transformations.

The node at the top of the stack is the the one that gtk_snapshot_append_…
functions operate on. Use the gtk_snapshot_push_… functions and `Snapshot::pop`
to change the current node.

The typical way to obtain a `Snapshot` object is as an argument to
the `WidgetClass.snapshot`() vfunc. If you need to create your own `Snapshot`,
use `Snapshot::new`.

<!-- impl Snapshot::fn push_debug -->
Inserts a debug node with a message. Debug nodes don't affect
the rendering at all, but can be helpful in identifying parts

## `message`
a printf-style format string
<!-- impl Snapshot::fn push_gl_shader -->
Push a `gsk::GLShaderNode` with a specific `gsk::GLShader` and a set of uniform values
to use while rendering. Additionally this takes a list of `n_children` other nodes
which will be passed to the `gsk::GLShaderNode`.

The `take_args` argument is a block of data to use for uniform
arguments, as per types and offsets defined by the `shader`. Normally this is
generated by `gsk::GLShader::format_args` or `GskGLShaderArgBuilder`.
The snapshotter takes ownership of `take_args`, so the caller should not free it
after this.

If the renderer doesn't support GL shaders, or if there is any problem when
compiling the shader, then the node will draw pink. You should use
`gsk::GLShader::compile` to ensure the `shader` will work for the renderer
before using it.

If the shader requires textures (see `gsk::GLShader::get_n_textures`), then it is
expected that you call `Snapshot::gl_shader_pop_texture` the number of times that are
required. Each of these calls will generate a node that is added as a child to the gl shader
node, which in turn will render these offscreen and pass as a texture to the shader.

Once all textures (if any) are pop:ed, you must call the regular `Snapshot::pop`.

If you want to use pre-existing textures as input to the shader rather than
rendering new ones, use `Snapshot::append_texture` to push a texture node. These
will be used directly rather than being re-rendered.

For details on how to write shaders, see `gsk::GLShader`.

<!-- impl Snapshot::fn restore -->
Restores `self` to the state saved by a preceding call to
`Snapshot::save` and removes that state from the stack of
saved states.
<!-- impl Snapshot::fn rotate -->
Rotates @`self`'s coordinate system by `angle` degrees in 2D space -
or in 3D speak, rotates around the z axis.
## `angle`

<!-- impl Snapshot::fn save -->
Makes a copy of the current state of `self` and saves it
on an internal stack of saved states for `self`. When
`Snapshot::restore` is called, `self` will be restored to
the saved state. Multiple calls to `Snapshot::save` and
`Snapshot::restore` can be nested; each call to
`Snapshot::restore` restores the state from the matching paired
`Snapshot::save`.

It is necessary to clear all saved states with corresponding calls
to `Snapshot::restore`.

called after this is `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`.

# Returns

the constructed `gsk::RenderNode`
<!-- impl Snapshot::fn to_paintable -->
Returns a paintable encapsulating the render node
that was constructed by `self`. After calling
this function, it is no longer possible to add more

<!-- struct SortListModel -->
`SortListModel` is a list model that takes a list model and
sorts its elements according to a `Sorter`.

The model can be set up to do incremental sorting, so that
sorting long lists doesn't block the UI. See
`SortListModel::set_incremental` for details.

`SortListModel` is a generic model and because of that it
cannot take advantage of any external knowledge when sorting.
If you run into performance issues with `SortListModel`, it
is strongly recommended that you write your own sorting list
model.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn new -->
Creates a new sort list model that uses the `sorter` to sort `model`.
## `model`
the model to sort, or `None`
## `sorter`
the `Sorter` to sort `model` with, or `None`

# Returns

a new `SortListModel`
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn get_incremental -->
Returns whether incremental sorting was enabled via
`SortListModel::set_incremental`.

# Returns

`true` if incremental sorting is enabled
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn get_model -->
Gets the model currently sorted or `None` if none.

# Returns

The model that gets sorted
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn get_pending -->
Estimates progress of an ongoing sorting operation

The estimate is the number of items that would still need to be
sorted to finish the sorting operation if this was a linear
algorithm. So this number is not related to how many items are
already correctly sorted.

If you want to estimate the progress, you can use code like this:

```C
  pending = gtk_sort_list_model_get_pending (self);
  model = gtk_sort_list_model_get_model (self);
  progress = 1.0 - pending / (double) MAX (1, g_list_model_get_n_items (model));
```

If no sort operation is ongoing - in particular when
`SortListModel:incremental` is `false` - this function returns 0.

# Returns

a progress estimate of remaining items to sort
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn get_sorter -->
Gets the sorter that is used to sort `self`.

# Returns

the sorter of `self`
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn set_incremental -->
Sets the sort model to do an incremental sort.

When incremental sorting is enabled, the sortlistmodel will not do
a complete sort immediately, but will instead queue an idle handler that
incrementally sorts the items towards their correct position. This of
course means that items do not instantly appear in the right place. It
also means that the total sorting time is a lot slower.

When your filter blocks the UI while sorting, you might consider
turning this on. Depending on your model and sorters, this may become
interesting around 10,000 to 100,000 items.

By default, incremental sorting is disabled.

See `SortListModel::get_pending` for progress information
about an ongoing incremental sorting operation.
## `incremental`
`true` to sort incrementally
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn set_model -->
Sets the model to be sorted. The `model`'s item type must conform to
the item type of `self`.
## `model`
The model to be sorted
<!-- impl SortListModel::fn set_sorter -->
Sets a new sorter on `self`.
## `sorter`

<!-- enum SortType -->
Determines the direction of a sort.
<!-- enum SortType::variant Ascending -->
Sorting is in ascending order.
<!-- enum SortType::variant Descending -->
Sorting is in descending order.
<!-- struct Sorter -->
`Sorter` is the way to describe sorting criteria.
Its primary user is `SortListModel`.

The model will use a sorter to determine the order in which its items should appear
by calling `SorterExt::compare` for pairs of items.

Sorters may change their sorting behavior through their lifetime. In that case,
they will emit the `Sorter::changed` signal to notify that the sort order is
no longer valid and should be updated by calling `SorterExt::compare` again.

GTK provides various pre-made sorter implementations for common sorting operations.
`ColumnView` has built-in support for sorting lists via the `ColumnViewColumn:sorter`
property, where the user can change the sorting by clicking on list headers.

Of course, in particular for large lists, it is also possible to subclass `Sorter`
and provide one's own sorter.

# Implements

[`SorterExt`](trait.SorterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait SorterExt -->
Trait containing all `Sorter` methods.

# Implementors

[`CustomSorter`](struct.CustomSorter.html), [`MultiSorter`](struct.MultiSorter.html), [`NumericSorter`](struct.NumericSorter.html), [`Sorter`](struct.Sorter.html), [`StringSorter`](struct.StringSorter.html), [`TreeListRowSorter`](struct.TreeListRowSorter.html)
<!-- trait SorterExt::fn changed -->
Emits the `Sorter::changed` signal to notify all users of the sorter
that it has changed. Users of the sorter should then update the sort
order via `SorterExt::compare`.

Depending on the `change` parameter, it may be possible to update
the sort order without a full resorting. Refer to the `SorterChange`
documentation for details.

This function is intended for implementors of `Sorter` subclasses and
should not be called from other functions.
## `change`
How the sorter changed
<!-- trait SorterExt::fn compare -->
Compares two given items according to the sort order implemented
by the sorter.

Sorters implement a partial order:
* It is reflexive, ie a = a
* It is antisymmetric, ie if a < b and b < a, then a = b
* It is transitive, ie given any 3 items with a ≤ b and b ≤ c,
 then a ≤ c

The sorter may signal it conforms to additional constraints
via the return value of `SorterExt::get_order`.
## `item1`
first item to compare
## `item2`
second item to compare

# Returns

`Ordering::Equal` if `item1` == `item2`,
 `Ordering::Smaller` if `item1` < `item2`,
 `Ordering::Larger` if `item1` > `item2`
<!-- trait SorterExt::fn get_order -->
Gets the order that `self` conforms to. See `SorterOrder` for details
of the possible return values.

This function is intended to allow optimizations.

# Returns

The order
<!-- trait SorterExt::fn connect_changed -->
This signal is emitted whenever the sorter changed. Users of the sorter
should then update the sort order again via `SorterExt::compare`.

`SortListModel` handles this signal automatically.

Depending on the `change` parameter, it may be possible to update
the sort order without a full resorting. Refer to the `SorterChange`
documentation for details.
## `change`
how the sorter changed
<!-- enum SorterChange -->
Describes changes in a sorter in more detail and allows users
to optimize resorting.
<!-- enum SorterChange::variant Different -->
The sorter change cannot be described
 by any of the other enumeration values
<!-- enum SorterChange::variant Inverted -->
The sort order was inverted. Comparisons
 that returned `Ordering::Smaller` now return `Ordering::Larger`
 and vice versa. Other comparisons return the same values as before.
<!-- enum SorterChange::variant LessStrict -->
The sorter is less strict: Comparisons
 may now return `Ordering::Equal` that did not do so before.
<!-- enum SorterChange::variant MoreStrict -->
The sorter is more strict: Comparisons
 that did return `Ordering::Equal` may not do so anymore.
<!-- enum SorterOrder -->
Describes the type of order that a `Sorter` may describe.
<!-- enum SorterOrder::variant Partial -->
A partial order. Any `Ordering` is possible.
<!-- enum SorterOrder::variant None -->
No order, all elements are considered equal.
 `SorterExt::compare` will only return `Ordering::Equal`.
<!-- enum SorterOrder::variant Total -->
A total order. `SorterExt::compare` will only
 return `Ordering::Equal` if an item is compared with itself. Two
 different items will never cause this value to be returned.
<!-- struct SpinButton -->
A `SpinButton` is an ideal way to allow the user to set the value of
some attribute. Rather than having to directly type a number into a
`Entry`, `SpinButton` allows the user to click on one of two arrows
to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be
typed in, with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a
given range.

The main properties of a `SpinButton` are through an adjustment.
See the `Adjustment` section for more details about an adjustment's
properties.

Note that `SpinButton` will by default make its entry large enough to
accommodate the lower and upper bounds of the adjustment. If this is
not desired, the automatic sizing can be turned off by explicitly
setting `Editable::width-chars` to a value != -1.

## Using a `SpinButton` to get an integer


```C
// Provides a function to retrieve an integer value from a GtkSpinButton
// and creates a spin button to model percentage values.

int
grab_int_value (GtkSpinButton *button,
                gpointer       user_data)
{
  return gtk_spin_button_get_value_as_int (button);

  GtkWidget *window, *button;
  GtkAdjustment *adjustment;

  adjustment = gtk_adjustment_new (50.0, 0.0, 100.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.0);

  window = gtk_window_new ();

  // creates the spinbutton, with no decimal places
  button = gtk_spin_button_new (adjustment, 1.0, 0);
  gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);

  gtk_widget_show (window);
}
```

## Using a `SpinButton` to get a floating point value


```C
// Provides a function to retrieve a floating point value from a
// GtkSpinButton, and creates a high precision spin button.

  window = gtk_window_new ();

  // creates the spinbutton, with three decimal places
  button = gtk_spin_button_new (adjustment, 0.001, 3);
  gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);

  gtk_widget_show (window);

`GtkSpinButtons` main CSS node has the name spinbutton. It creates subnodes
for the entry and the two buttons, with these names. The button nodes have
the style classes .up and .down. The `Text` subnodes (if present) are put
below the text node. The orientation of the spin button is reflected in
the .vertical or .horizontal style class on the main node.

# Accessiblity

`SpinButton` uses the `AccessibleRole::SpinButton` role.

<!-- impl SpinButton::fn update -->
Manually force an update of the spin button.
<!-- impl SpinButton::fn connect_change_value -->
The ::change-value signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a value change.

`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal are Up/Down and PageUp and/PageDown.
## `scroll`

   g_free (text);

   return TRUE;
}
```

# Returns

`true` if the value has been displayed
<!-- impl SpinButton::fn connect_value_changed -->
The ::value-changed signal is emitted when the value represented by
`spinbutton` changes. Also see the `SpinButton::output` signal.
<!-- impl SpinButton::fn connect_wrapped -->
The ::wrapped signal is emitted right after the spinbutton wraps
from its maximum to minimum value or vice-versa.
<!-- enum SpinButtonUpdatePolicy -->
The spin button update policy determines whether the spin button displays
values even if they are outside the bounds of its adjustment.
See `SpinButton::set_update_policy`.

<!-- struct Spinner -->
A `Spinner` widget displays an icon-size spinning animation.
It is often used as an alternative to a `ProgressBar` for
displaying indefinite activity, instead of actual progress.

To start the animation, use `Spinner::start`, to stop it
use `Spinner::stop`.

# CSS nodes

`Spinner` has a single CSS node with the name spinner.
When the animation is active, the :checked pseudoclass is
added to this node.

# Implements

<!-- impl Spinner::fn start -->
Starts the animation of the spinner.
<!-- impl Spinner::fn stop -->
Stops the animation of the spinner.
<!-- struct Stack -->
The `Stack` widget is a container which only shows
one of its children at a time. In contrast to `Notebook`,
`Stack` does not provide a means for users to change the
visible child. Instead, the `StackSwitcher` widget can be
used with `Stack` to provide this functionality.

Transitions between pages can be animated as slides or
fades. This can be controlled with `Stack::set_transition_type`.
These animations respect the `Settings:gtk-enable-animations`
setting.

`Stack` maintains a `StackPage` object for each added
child, which holds additional per-child properties. You
obtain the `StackPage` for a child with `Stack::get_page`.

# `Stack` as `Buildable`

To set child-specific properties in a .ui file, create `StackPage`
objects explicitly, and set the child widget as a property on it:

```text
  <object class="GtkStack" id="stack">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkStackPage">
        <property name="name">page1</property>
        <property name="title">In the beginning…</property>
        <property name="child">
          <object class="GtkLabel">
            <property name="label">It was dark</property>
          </object>
        </property>
      </object>
    </child>
```

# CSS nodes

`Stack` has a single CSS node named stack.

# Accessibility

`Stack` uses the `AccessibleRole::TabPanel` for the stack
pages, which are the accessible parent objects of the child widgets.

## `name`
the name for `child`
## `title`
a human-readable title for `child`

# Returns

the child to remove
<!-- impl Stack::fn set_hhomogeneous -->
Sets the `Stack` to be horizontally homogeneous or not.
If it is homogeneous, the `Stack` will request the same
width for all its children. If it isn't, the stack
may change width when a different child becomes visible.
## `hhomogeneous`
`true` to make `self` horizontally homogeneous
<!-- impl Stack::fn set_interpolate_size -->
Sets whether or not `self` will interpolate its size when
changing the visible child. If the `Stack:interpolate-size`
property is set to `true`, `self` will interpolate its size between
the current one and the one it'll take after changing the
visible child, according to the set transition duration.
## `interpolate_size`
the new value
<!-- impl Stack::fn set_transition_duration -->
Sets the duration that transitions between pages in `self`
will take.
## `duration`

at runtime, so it is possible to change the animation
based on the page that is about to become current.
## `transition`
the new transition type
<!-- impl Stack::fn set_vhomogeneous -->
Sets the `Stack` to be vertically homogeneous or not.
If it is homogeneous, the `Stack` will request the same

(see `WidgetExt::show`) in order to become the visible
child of `self`.
## `child`
a child of `self`
<!-- impl Stack::fn set_visible_child_full -->
Makes the child with the given name visible.

<!-- struct StackSidebar -->
A `StackSidebar` enables you to quickly and easily provide a
consistent "sidebar" object for your user interface.

In order to use a `StackSidebar`, you simply use a `Stack` to
organize your UI flow, and add the sidebar to your sidebar area. You
can use `StackSidebar::set_stack` to connect the `StackSidebar`
to the `Stack`.

# CSS nodes

`StackSidebar` has a single CSS node with name stacksidebar and
style class .sidebar.

When circumstances require it, `StackSidebar` adds the
.needs-attention style class to the widgets representing the stack
pages.

# Implements

## `stack`
a `Stack`
<!-- struct StackSwitcher -->
The `StackSwitcher` widget acts as a controller for a
`Stack`; it shows a row of buttons to switch between
the various pages of the associated stack widget.

All the content for the buttons comes from the child properties
of the `Stack`; the button visibility in a `StackSwitcher`
widget is controlled by the visibility of the child in the
`Stack`.

It is possible to associate multiple `StackSwitcher` widgets
with the same `Stack` widget.

# CSS nodes

`StackSwitcher` has a single CSS node named stackswitcher and
style class .stack-switcher.

When circumstances require it, `StackSwitcher` adds the
.needs-attention style class to the widgets representing the
stack pages.

# Accessibility

`StackSwitcher` uses the `AccessibleRole::TabList` role
and uses the `AccessibleRole::Tab` for its buttons.

<!-- struct Statusbar -->
A `Statusbar` is usually placed along the bottom of an application's
main `Window`. It may provide a regular commentary of the application's
status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be
used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
is complete in an FTP client, for example).

Status bars in GTK+ maintain a stack of messages. The message at
the top of the each bar’s stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

Any messages added to a statusbar’s stack must specify a
context id that is used to uniquely identify
the source of a message. This context id can be generated by
`Statusbar::get_context_id`, given a message and the statusbar that
it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a stack, and when
choosing which message to display, the stack structure is adhered to,
regardless of the context identifier of a message.

One could say that a statusbar maintains one stack of messages for
display purposes, but allows multiple message producers to maintain
sub-stacks of the messages they produced (via context ids).

Status bars are created using `Statusbar::new`.

Messages are added to the bar’s stack with `Statusbar::push`.

The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
`Statusbar::pop`. A message can be removed from anywhere in the
stack if its message id was recorded at the time it was added. This
is done using `Statusbar::remove`.

# CSS node

`Statusbar` has a single CSS node with name statusbar.

<!-- struct StringFilter -->
`StringFilter` determines whether to include items by looking
at strings and comparing them to a fixed search term. The strings
are obtained from the items by evaluating a `Expression`.

`StringFilter` has several different modes of comparison - it
can match the whole string, just a prefix, or any substring.

# Implements

[`FilterExt`](trait.FilterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl StringFilter::fn new -->

 with the search string.
<!-- struct StringList -->
`StringList` is a list model that wraps an array of strings.

The objects in the model have a "string" property.

`StringList` is well-suited for any place where you would
typically use a `char*[]`, but need a list model.

# `StringList` as `Buildable`

The `StringList` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding items directly using the `<items>` element and
specifying `<item>` elements for each item. Each `<item>` element
supports the regular translation attributes “translatable”,
“context” and “comments”.

Here is a UI definition fragment specifying a `StringList`

```text
<object class="GtkStringList">
  <items>
    <item translatable="yes">Factory</item>
    <item translatable="yes">Home</item>
    <item translatable="yes">Subway</item>
  </items>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl StringList::fn new -->
Creates a new `StringList` with the given `strings`.
## `strings`
The strings to put in the model

# Returns

a new `StringList`
<!-- impl StringList::fn append -->
Appends `string` to `self`.

The `string` will be copied. See `StringList::take`
for a way to avoid that.
## `string`
the string to insert
<!-- impl StringList::fn get_string -->
Gets the string that is at `position` in `self`. If `self`
does not contain `position` items, `None` is returned.

This function returns the const char *. To get the
object wrapping it, use `gio::ListModel::get_item`.
## `position`
the position to get the string for

# Returns

the string at the given position
<!-- impl StringList::fn remove -->
Removes the string at `position` from `self`. `position` must
be smaller than the current length of the list.
## `position`
the position of the string that is to be removed
<!-- impl StringList::fn splice -->
Changes `self` by removing `n_removals` strings and adding `additions`
to it.

This function is more efficient than `StringList::append` and
`StringList::remove`, because it only emits
`gio::ListModel::items-changed` once for the change.

This function copies the strings in `additions`.

The parameters `position` and `n_removals` must be correct (ie:
`position` + `n_removals` must be less than or equal to the length
of the list at the time this function is called).
## `position`
the position at which to make the change
## `n_removals`
the number of strings to remove
## `additions`
The strings to add
<!-- impl StringList::fn take -->
Adds `string` to self at the end, and takes
ownership of it.

This variant of `StringList::append` is
convenient for formatting strings:


```text
gtk_string_list_take (self, g_strdup_print ("%d dollars", lots));
```
## `string`
the string to insert
<!-- struct StringObject -->


# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl StringObject::fn new -->

<!-- struct StringSorter -->
`StringSorter` is a `Sorter` that compares strings. It does the
comparison in a linguistically correct way using the current locale by
normalizing Unicode strings and possibly case-folding them before
performing the comparison.

To obtain the strings to compare, this sorter evaluates a `Expression`.

# Implements

[`SorterExt`](trait.SorterExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl StringSorter::fn new -->
Creates a new string sorter that compares items using the given
`expression`.

Unless an expression is set on it, this sorter will always
compare items as invalid.

<!-- impl StringSorter::fn get_expression -->
Gets the expression that is evaluated to obtain strings from items.

# Returns

a `Expression`, or `None`

Gets whether the sorter ignores case differences.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is ignoring case differences
<!-- impl StringSorter::fn set_expression -->
Sets the expression that is evaluated to obtain strings from items.

The expression must have the type G_TYPE_STRING.
## `expression`
a `Expression`, or `None`
<!-- impl StringSorter::fn set_ignore_case -->
Sets whether the sorter will ignore case differences.
## `ignore_case`
`true` to ignore case differences

If matching is case sensitive
<!-- impl StringSorter::fn set_property_ignore_case -->
If matching is case sensitive
<!-- struct StyleContext -->
`StyleContext` is an object that stores styling information affecting
a widget.

In order to construct the final style information, `StyleContext`
queries information from all attached ``GtkStyleProviders``. Style providers
can be either attached explicitly to the context through
`StyleContextExt::add_provider`, or to the display through
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`. The resulting style is a
combination of all providers’ information in priority order.

For GTK widgets, any `StyleContext` returned by
`WidgetExt::get_style_context` will already have a `gdk::Display` and
RTL/LTR information set. The style context will also be updated
automatically if any of these settings change on the widget.

# Style Classes # {`gtkstylecontext`-classes}

Widgets can add style classes to their context, which can be used to associate
different styles by class. The documentation for individual widgets lists
which style classes it uses itself, and which style classes may be added by
applications to affect their appearance.

GTK defines macros for a number of style classes.

# Custom styling in UI libraries and applications

If you are developing a library with custom ``GtkWidgets`` that
render differently than standard components, you may need to add a
`StyleProvider` yourself with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK`
priority, either a `CssProvider` or a custom object implementing the
`StyleProvider` interface. This way themes may still attempt
to style your UI elements in a different way if needed so.

If you are using custom styling on an applications, you probably want then
to make your style information prevail to the theme’s, so you must use
a `StyleProvider` with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`
priority, keep in mind that the user settings in
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` will
still take precedence over your changes, as it uses the
`GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER` priority.

# Implements

[`StyleContextExt`](trait.StyleContextExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait StyleContextExt -->
Trait containing all `StyleContext` methods.

# Implementors

[`StyleContext`](struct.StyleContext.html)
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn add_provider_for_display -->
Adds a global style provider to `display`, which will be used
in style construction for all ``GtkStyleContexts`` under `display`.

GTK uses this to make styling information from `Settings`
available.

Note: If both priorities are the same, A `StyleProvider`
added through `StyleContextExt::add_provider` takes precedence
over another added through this function.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- impl StyleContext::fn remove_provider_for_display -->
Removes `provider` from the global style providers list in `display`.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn add_class -->
Adds a style class to `self`, so later uses of the
style context will make use of this new class for styling.

In the CSS file format, a `Entry` defining a “search”
class, would be matched by:


```CSS
entry.search { ... }
```

While any widget defining a “search” class would be
matched by:

```CSS
.search { ... }
```
## `class_name`
class name to use in styling
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn add_provider -->
Adds a style provider to `self`, to be used in style construction.
Note that a style provider added by this function only affects
the style of the widget to which `self` belongs. If you want
to affect the style of all widgets, use
`StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

Note: If both priorities are the same, a `StyleProvider`
added through this function takes precedence over another added
through `StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
## `priority`
the priority of the style provider. The lower
 it is, the earlier it will be used in the style
 construction. Typically this will be in the range
 between `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` and
 `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_border -->
Gets the border for a given state as a `Border`.
## `border`
return value for the border settings
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_color -->
Gets the foreground color for a given state.
## `color`
return value for the foreground color
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_display -->
Returns the `gdk::Display` to which `self` is attached.

return value for the padding settings
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_scale -->
Returns the scale used for assets.

# Returns

the scale
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn get_state -->
Returns the state used for style matching.

This method should only be used to retrieve the `StateFlags`
to pass to `StyleContext` methods, like `StyleContextExt::get_padding`.
If you need to retrieve the current state of a `Widget`, use
`WidgetExt::get_state_flags`.

# Returns

the state flags
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn has_class -->
Returns `true` if `self` currently has defined the
given class name.
## `class_name`
a class name

# Returns

`true` if `self` has `class_name` defined
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn lookup_color -->
Looks up and resolves a color name in the `self` color map.
## `color_name`
color name to lookup
## `color`
Return location for the looked up color

# Returns

`true` if `color_name` was found and resolved, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn remove_class -->
Removes `class_name` from `self`.
## `class_name`
class name to remove
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn remove_provider -->
Removes `provider` from the style providers list in `self`.
## `provider`
a `StyleProvider`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn restore -->
Restores `self` state to a previous stage.
See `StyleContextExt::save`.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn save -->
Saves the `self` state, so temporary modifications done through
`StyleContextExt::add_class`, `StyleContextExt::remove_class`,
`StyleContextExt::set_state`, etc. can quickly be reverted
in one go through `StyleContextExt::restore`.

The matching call to `StyleContextExt::restore` must be done
before GTK returns to the main loop.
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_display -->
Attaches `self` to the given display.

The display is used to add style information from “global” style
providers, such as the display's `Settings` instance.

If you are using a `StyleContext` returned from
`WidgetExt::get_style_context`, you do not need to
call this yourself.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_scale -->
Sets the scale to use when getting image assets for the style.
## `scale`
scale
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the state to be used for style matching.
## `flags`
state to represent
<!-- trait StyleContextExt::fn to_string -->
Converts the style context into a string representation.

The string representation always includes information about
the name, state, id, visibility and style classes of the CSS
node that is backing `self`. Depending on the flags, more
information may be included.

This function is intended for testing and debugging of the
CSS implementation in GTK. There are no guarantees about
the format of the returned string, it may change.
## `flags`
Flags that determine what to print

# Returns

a newly allocated string representing `self`

Print the entire tree of
 CSS nodes starting at the style context's node
<!-- struct StyleContextPrintFlags::const SHOW_STYLE -->
Show the values of the
 CSS properties for each node
<!-- struct StyleContextPrintFlags::const SHOW_CHANGE -->
Show information about
 what changes affect the styles
<!-- struct StyleProvider -->
`StyleProvider` is an interface used to provide style information to a `StyleContext`.
See `StyleContextExt::add_provider` and `StyleContext::add_provider_for_display`.

<!-- struct Switch -->
`Switch` is a widget that has two states: on or off. The user can control
which state should be active by clicking the empty area, or by dragging the
handle.

`Switch` can also handle situations where the underlying state changes with
a delay. See `Switch::state-set` for details.

# CSS nodes


```plain
switch
├── label
├── label
╰── slider
```

`Switch` has four css nodes, the main node with the name switch and subnodes
for the slider and the on and off labels. Neither of them is using any style classes.

# Accessibility

`Switch` uses the `AccessibleRole::Switch` role.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`ActionableExt`](trait.ActionableExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html), [`ActionableExtManual`](prelude/trait.ActionableExtManual.html)
<!-- impl Switch::fn new -->
Creates a new `Switch` widget.

# Returns

the newly created `Switch` instance
<!-- impl Switch::fn get_active -->
Gets whether the `Switch` is in its “on” or “off” state.

# Returns

`true` if the `Switch` is active, and `false` otherwise
<!-- impl Switch::fn get_state -->
Gets the underlying state of the `Switch`.

# Returns

the underlying state
<!-- impl Switch::fn set_active -->
Changes the state of `self` to the desired one.
## `is_active`
`true` if `self` should be active, and `false` otherwise
<!-- impl Switch::fn set_state -->
Sets the underlying state of the `Switch`.

Normally, this is the same as `Switch:active`, unless the switch
is set up for delayed state changes. This function is typically
called from a `Switch::state-set` signal handler.

See `Switch::state-set` for details.
## `state`
the new state
<!-- impl Switch::fn connect_activate -->
The ::activate signal on `Switch` is an action signal and
emitting it causes the switch to animate.
Applications should never connect to this signal, but use the
notify::active signal.
<!-- impl Switch::fn connect_state_set -->
The ::state-set signal on `Switch` is emitted to change the underlying
state. It is emitted when the user changes the switch position. The
default handler keeps the state in sync with the `Switch:active`
property.

To implement delayed state change, applications can connect to this signal,
initiate the change of the underlying state, and call `Switch::set_state`
when the underlying state change is complete. The signal handler should
return `true` to prevent the default handler from running.

Visually, the underlying state is represented by the trough color of
the switch, while the `Switch:active` property is represented by the
position of the switch.
## `state`
the new state of the switch

# Returns

`true` to stop the signal emission
<!-- impl Switch::fn get_property_active -->
Whether the `Switch` widget is in its on or off state.
<!-- impl Switch::fn set_property_active -->
Whether the `Switch` widget is in its on or off state.
<!-- impl Switch::fn get_property_state -->
The backend state that is controlled by the switch.
See `Switch::state-set` for details.
<!-- impl Switch::fn set_property_state -->
The backend state that is controlled by the switch.
See `Switch::state-set` for details.
<!-- enum SystemSetting -->
Values that can be passed to the `WidgetClass`.system_setting_changed
vfunc to indicate that a system setting has changed and widgets may
need to drop caches, or react otherwise.

Most of the values correspond to `Settings` properties.

More values may be added over time.
<!-- enum SystemSetting::variant Dpi -->
the `Settings:gtk-xft-dpi` setting has changed
<!-- enum SystemSetting::variant FontName -->
The `Settings:gtk-font-name` setting has changed
<!-- enum SystemSetting::variant FontConfig -->
The font configuration has changed in a way that
 requires text to be redrawn. This can be any of the
 `Settings:gtk-xft-antialias`, `Settings:gtk-xft-hinting`,
 `Settings:gtk-xft-hintstyle`, `Settings:gtk-xft-rgba` or
 `Settings:gtk-fontconfig-timestamp` settings
<!-- enum SystemSetting::variant Display -->
The display has changed
<!-- enum SystemSetting::variant IconTheme -->
The icon theme has changed in a way that requires
 icons to be looked up again
<!-- struct Text -->
The `Text` widget is a single line text entry widget.

A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the
entered text is longer than the allocation of the widget, the widget
will scroll so that the cursor position is visible.

When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
it can be put into “password mode” using `Text::set_visibility`.
In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
in the current font, but it can be changed with `Text::set_invisible_char`.

If you are looking to add icons or progress display in an entry, look
at `Entry`. There other alternatives for more specialized use cases,
such as `SearchEntry`.

If you need multi-line editable text, look at `TextView`.

# CSS nodes


```plain
text[.read-only]
├── placeholder
├── undershoot.left
├── undershoot.right
├── [selection]
├── [block-cursor]
╰── [window.popup]
```

`Text` has a main node with the name text. Depending on the properties
of the widget, the .read-only style class may appear.

When the entry has a selection, it adds a subnode with the name selection.

When the entry is in overwrite mode, it adds a subnode with the name block-cursor
that determines how the block cursor is drawn.

The CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode below text as well.

The undershoot nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content
is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the .left and .right style classes
added depending on where the indication is drawn.

When touch is used and touch selection handles are shown, they are using
CSS nodes with name cursor-handle. They get the .top or .bottom style class
depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If there is
just a single handle for the text cursor, it gets the style class .insertion-cursor.

# Accessibility

`Text` uses the `AccessibleRole::None` role, which causes it to be skipped
for accessibility. This is because `Text` is expected to be used as a delegate
for a `Editable` implementation that will be represented to accessibility.

<!-- impl Text::fn get_input_purpose -->
Gets the value of the `Text:input-purpose` property.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_invisible_char -->
Retrieves the character displayed in place of the real characters
for entries with visibility set to false. Note that GTK does not
compute this value unless it needs it, so the value returned by
this function is not very useful unless it has been explicitly
set with `Text::set_invisible_char`

# Returns

the current invisible char, or 0, if `text` does not
 show invisible text at all.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_max_length -->
Retrieves the maximum allowed length of the text in
`self`. See `Text::set_max_length`.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and

whether the text is overwritten when typing.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_placeholder_text -->
Retrieves the text that will be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused

# Returns

a pointer to the placeholder text as a string.
 This string points to internally allocated storage in the widget and must
 not be freed, modified or stored. If no placeholder text has been set,
 `None` will be returned.
<!-- impl Text::fn get_propagate_text_width -->
Returns whether the `Text` will grow and shrink
with the content.

# Returns

`true` if `self` will propagate the text width
<!-- impl Text::fn get_tabs -->

any.

# Returns

the tabstops, or `None` if none was set.

<!-- impl Text::fn grab_focus_without_selecting -->
Causes `self` to have keyboard focus.

It behaves like `WidgetExt::grab_focus`,
except that it doesn't select the contents of `self`.
You only want to call this on some special entries
which the user usually doesn't want to replace all text in,
such as search-as-you-type entries.

# Returns

`true` if focus is now inside `self`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_activates_default -->
If `activates` is `true`, pressing Enter in the `self` will activate the default
widget for the window containing the self. This usually means that
the dialog box containing the self will be closed, since the default
widget is usually one of the dialog buttons.
## `activates`
`true` to activate window’s default widget on Enter keypress
<!-- impl Text::fn set_attributes -->
Sets a `pango::AttrList`; the attributes in the list are applied to the
text.
## `attrs`
a `pango::AttrList` or `None` to unset
<!-- impl Text::fn set_buffer -->
Set the `EntryBuffer` object which holds the text for
this widget.
## `buffer`
a `EntryBuffer`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_enable_emoji_completion -->

can be used by on-screen keyboards and other input
methods to adjust their behaviour.
## `purpose`
the purpose
<!-- impl Text::fn set_invisible_char -->
Sets the character to use in place of the actual text when
`Text::set_visibility` has been called to set text visibility
to `false`. i.e. this is the character used in “password mode” to
show the user how many characters have been typed.

By default, GTK picks the best invisible char available in the
current font. If you set the invisible char to 0, then the user
will get no feedback at all; there will be no text on the screen
as they type.
## `ch`
a Unicode character
<!-- impl Text::fn set_max_length -->
Sets the maximum allowed length of the contents of the widget.

If the current contents are longer than the given length, then
they will be truncated to fit.

This is equivalent to getting `self`'s `EntryBuffer` and
calling `EntryBuffer::set_max_length` on it.
]|
## `length`
the maximum length of the self, or 0 for no maximum.
 (other than the maximum length of entries.) The value passed in will
 be clamped to the range 0-65536.
<!-- impl Text::fn set_overwrite_mode -->
Sets whether the text is overwritten when typing in the `Text`.
## `overwrite`
new value
<!-- impl Text::fn set_placeholder_text -->
Sets text to be displayed in `self` when it is empty.

This can be used to give a visual hint of the expected
contents of the self.
## `text`
a string to be displayed when `self` is empty and unfocused, or `None`
<!-- impl Text::fn set_propagate_text_width -->
Sets whether the `Text` should grow and shrink with the content.
## `propagate_text_width`

that is pasted into the widget.
## `truncate_multiline`
`true` to truncate multi-line text
<!-- impl Text::fn set_visibility -->
Sets whether the contents of the self are visible or not.
When visibility is set to `false`, characters are displayed
as the invisible char, and will also appear that way when
the text in the self widget is copied to the clipboard.

By default, GTK picks the best invisible character available
in the current font, but it can be changed with
`Text::set_invisible_char`.

Note that you probably want to set `Text:input-purpose`
to `InputPurpose::Password` or `InputPurpose::Pin` to
inform input methods about the purpose of this self,
in addition to setting visibility to `false`.
## `visible`
`true` if the contents of the self are displayed
 as plaintext

Ctrl-x and Shift-Delete.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_delete_from_cursor -->
The ::delete-from-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a text deletion.

If the `type_` is `DeleteType::Chars`, GTK deletes the selection
if there is one, otherwise it deletes the requested number
of characters.

The default bindings for this signal are
Delete for deleting a character and Ctrl-Delete for
deleting a word.
## `type_`
the granularity of the deletion, as a `DeleteType`
## `count`
the number of `type_` units to delete
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_insert_at_cursor -->

<!-- impl Text::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `self_`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically.

The default bindings for this signal come in two variants,
the variant with the Shift modifier extends the selection,
the variant without the Shift modifier does not.
There are too many key combinations to list them all here.
- Arrow keys move by individual characters/lines
- Ctrl-arrow key combinations move by words/paragraphs
- Home/End keys move to the ends of the buffer
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a `MovementStep`
## `count`

[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted to paste the contents of the clipboard
into the text view.

The default bindings for this signal are
Ctrl-v and Shift-Insert.
<!-- impl Text::fn connect_preedit_changed -->
If an input method is used, the typed text will not immediately
be committed to the buffer. So if you are interested in the text,
connect to this signal.

the mark to add
## `where_`
location to place mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn add_selection_clipboard -->
Adds `clipboard` to the list of clipboards in which the selection
contents of `self` are available. In most cases, `clipboard` will be
the `gdk::Clipboard` returned by `WidgetExt::get_primary_clipboard`
for a view of `self`.
## `clipboard`
a `gdk::Clipboard`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn apply_tag -->
Emits the “apply-tag” signal on `self`. The default
handler for the signal applies `tag` to the given range.
`start` and `end` do not have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn apply_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTable::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBufferExt::apply_tag`.
## `name`
name of a named `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be tagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be tagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn backspace -->
Performs the appropriate action as if the user hit the delete
key with the cursor at the position specified by `iter`. In the
normal case a single character will be deleted, but when
combining accents are involved, more than one character can
be deleted, and when precomposed character and accent combinations
are involved, less than one character will be deleted.

Because the buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become
invalid after calling this function; however, the `iter` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

`true` if the buffer was modified
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn begin_irreversible_action -->
Denotes the beginning of an action that may not be undone. This will cause
any previous operations in the undo/redo queue to be cleared.

This should be paired with a call to
`TextBufferExt::end_irreversible_action` after the irreversible action
has completed.

You may nest calls to `TextBufferExt::begin_irreversible_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_irreversible_action` pairs.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn begin_user_action -->
Called to indicate that the buffer operations between here and a
call to `TextBufferExt::end_user_action` are part of a single
user-visible operation. The operations between
`TextBufferExt::begin_user_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_user_action` can then be grouped when creating
an undo stack. `TextBuffer` maintains a count of calls to
`TextBufferExt::begin_user_action` that have not been closed with
a call to `TextBufferExt::end_user_action`, and emits the
“begin-user-action” and “end-user-action” signals only for the
outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions
from other user actions.

The “interactive” buffer mutation functions, such as
`TextBufferExt::insert_interactive`, automatically call begin/end
user action around the buffer operations they perform, so there's
no need to add extra calls if you user action consists solely of a
single call to one of those functions.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn copy_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` object to copy to
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_child_anchor -->
This is a convenience function which simply creates a child anchor
with `TextChildAnchor::new` and inserts it into the buffer
with `TextBufferExt::insert_child_anchor`. The new anchor is
owned by the buffer; no reference count is returned to
the caller of `TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor`.
## `iter`
location in the buffer

# Returns

the created child anchor
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_mark -->
Creates a mark at position `where_`. If `mark_name` is `None`, the mark
is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name using
`TextBufferExt::get_mark`. If a mark has left gravity, and text is
inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark will be moved to
the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity
(`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the right of
newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark
with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).

The caller of this function does not own a
reference to the returned `TextMark`, so you can ignore the
return value if you like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go
away when the buffer does.

Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal as notification of the mark's
initial placement.
## `mark_name`
name for mark, or `None`
## `where_`
location to place mark
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark has left gravity

# Returns

the new `TextMark` object
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn create_tag -->
Creates a tag and adds it to the tag table for `self`.
Equivalent to calling `TextTag::new` and then adding the
tag to the buffer’s tag table. The returned tag is owned by
the buffer’s tag table, so the ref count will be equal to one.

If `tag_name` is `None`, the tag is anonymous.

If `tag_name` is non-`None`, a tag called `tag_name` must not already
exist in the tag table for this buffer.

The `first_property_name` argument and subsequent arguments are a list
of properties to set on the tag, as with `gobject::ObjectExt::set`.
## `tag_name`
name of the new tag, or `None`
## `first_property_name`
name of first property to set, or `None`

# Returns

a new tag
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn cut_clipboard -->
Copies the currently-selected text to a clipboard, then deletes
said text if it’s editable.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` object to cut to
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete -->
Deletes text between `start` and `end`. The order of `start` and `end`
is not actually relevant; `TextBufferExt::delete` will reorder
them. This function actually emits the “delete-range” signal, and
the default handler of that signal deletes the text. Because the
buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid after
calling this function; however, the `start` and `end` will be
re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
## `start`
a position in `self`
## `end`
another position in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_interactive -->
Deletes all editable text in the given range.
Calls `TextBufferExt::delete` for each editable sub-range of
[`start`,`end`). `start` and `end` are revalidated to point to
the location of the last deleted range, or left untouched if
no text was deleted.
## `start_iter`
start of range to delete
## `end_iter`
end of range
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether some text was actually deleted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_mark -->
Deletes `mark`, so that it’s no longer located anywhere in the
buffer. Removes the reference the buffer holds to the mark, so if
you haven’t called `gobject::ObjectExt::ref` on the mark, it will be freed. Even
if the mark isn’t freed, most operations on `mark` become
invalid, until it gets added to a buffer again with
`TextBufferExt::add_mark`. Use `TextMarkExt::get_deleted` to
find out if a mark has been removed from its buffer.
The `TextBuffer::mark-deleted` signal will be emitted as notification after
the mark is deleted.
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_mark_by_name -->
Deletes the mark named `name`; the mark must exist. See
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn delete_selection -->
Deletes the range between the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks,
that is, the currently-selected text. If `interactive` is `true`,
the editability of the selection will be considered (users can’t delete
uneditable text).
## `interactive`
whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default

# Returns

whether there was a non-empty selection to delete
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn end_irreversible_action -->
Denotes the end of an action that may not be undone. This will cause
any previous operations in the undo/redo queue to be cleared.

This should be called after completing modifications to the text buffer
after `TextBufferExt::begin_irreversible_action` was called.

You may nest calls to `TextBufferExt::begin_irreversible_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_irreversible_action` pairs.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn end_user_action -->
Should be paired with a call to `TextBufferExt::begin_user_action`.
See that function for a full explanation.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_bounds -->
Retrieves the first and last iterators in the buffer, i.e. the
entire buffer lies within the range [`start`,`end`).
## `start`
iterator to initialize with first position in the buffer
## `end`
iterator to initialize with the end iterator
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_can_redo -->
Gets whether there is a redoable action in the history.

# Returns

`true` if there is an redoable action
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_can_undo -->
Gets whether there is an undoable action in the history.

# Returns

`true` if there is an undoable action
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_char_count -->
Gets the number of characters in the buffer; note that characters
and bytes are not the same, you can’t e.g. expect the contents of
the buffer in string form to be this many bytes long. The character
count is cached, so this function is very fast.

# Returns

number of characters in the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_enable_undo -->
Gets whether the buffer is saving modifications to the buffer to allow for
undo and redo actions.

See `TextBufferExt::begin_irreversible_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_irreversible_action` to create changes to the buffer
that cannot be undone.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_end_iter -->
Initializes `iter` with the “end iterator,” one past the last valid
character in the text buffer. If dereferenced with
`TextIter::get_char`, the end iterator has a character value of 0.
The entire buffer lies in the range from the first position in
the buffer (call `TextBufferExt::get_start_iter` to get
character position 0) to the end iterator.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_has_selection -->
Indicates whether the buffer has some text currently selected.

# Returns

`true` if the there is text selected
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_insert -->
Returns the mark that represents the cursor (insertion point).
Equivalent to calling `TextBufferExt::get_mark` to get the mark
named “insert”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves less
typing.

# Returns

insertion point mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_child_anchor -->
Obtains the location of `anchor` within `self`.
## `iter`
an iterator to be initialized
## `anchor`
a child anchor that appears in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line -->
Initializes `iter` to the start of the given line. If `line_number` is greater
than the number of lines in the `self`, the end iterator is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0

# Returns

whether the exact position has been found
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line_index -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `byte_index` within the given line.
`byte_index` must be the start of a UTF-8 character. Note bytes, not
characters; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.

If `line_number` is greater than the number of lines
in the `self`, the end iterator is returned. And if `byte_index` is off the
end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `byte_index`
byte index from start of line

# Returns

whether the exact position has been found
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_line_offset -->
Obtains an iterator pointing to `char_offset` within the given line. Note
characters, not bytes; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.

Before the 3.20 version, it was not allowed to pass an invalid location.

If `line_number` is greater than the number of lines
in the `self`, the end iterator is returned. And if `char_offset` is off the
end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `line_number`
line number counting from 0
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of line

# Returns

whether the exact position has been found
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_mark -->
Initializes `iter` with the current position of `mark`.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `mark`
a `TextMark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_iter_at_offset -->
Initializes `iter` to a position `char_offset` chars from the start
of the entire buffer. If `char_offset` is -1 or greater than the number
of characters in the buffer, `iter` is initialized to the end iterator,
the iterator one past the last valid character in the buffer.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
## `char_offset`
char offset from start of buffer, counting from 0, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_line_count -->
Obtains the number of lines in the buffer. This value is cached, so
the function is very fast.

# Returns

number of lines in the buffer
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_mark -->
Returns the mark named `name` in buffer `self`, or `None` if no such
mark exists in the buffer.
## `name`
a mark name

# Returns

a `TextMark`, or `None`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_max_undo_levels -->
Gets the maximum number of undo levels to perform. If 0, unlimited undo
actions may be performed. Note that this may have a memory usage impact
as it requires storing an additional copy of the inserted or removed text
within the text buffer.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_modified -->
Indicates whether the buffer has been modified since the last call
to `TextBufferExt::set_modified` set the modification flag to
`false`. Used for example to enable a “save” function in a text
editor.

# Returns

`true` if the buffer has been modified
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_selection_bound -->
Returns the mark that represents the selection bound. Equivalent
to calling `TextBufferExt::get_mark` to get the mark named
“selection_bound”, but very slightly more efficient, and involves
less typing.

The currently-selected text in `self` is the region between the
“selection_bound” and “insert” marks. If “selection_bound” and
“insert” are in the same place, then there is no current selection.
`TextBufferExt::get_selection_bounds` is another convenient function
for handling the selection, if you just want to know whether there’s a
selection and what its bounds are.

# Returns

selection bound mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_selection_bounds -->
Returns `true` if some text is selected; places the bounds
of the selection in `start` and `end` (if the selection has length 0,
then `start` and `end` are filled in with the same value).
`start` and `end` will be in ascending order. If `start` and `end` are
NULL, then they are not filled in, but the return value still indicates
whether text is selected.
## `start`
iterator to initialize with selection start
## `end`
iterator to initialize with selection end

# Returns

whether the selection has nonzero length
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_selection_content -->
Get a content provider for this buffer. It can be
used to make the content of `self` available in a
`gdk::Clipboard`, see `gdk::Clipboard::set_content`.

# Returns

a new `gdk::ContentProvider`.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. The returned string includes a
0xFFFC character whenever the buffer contains
embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBufferExt::get_text`. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a paintable or
widget is in the buffer.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_start_iter -->
Initialized `iter` with the first position in the text buffer. This
is the same as using `TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_offset` to get
the iter at character offset 0.
## `iter`
iterator to initialize
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_tag_table -->
Get the `TextTagTable` associated with this buffer.

# Returns

the buffer’s tag table
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_text -->
Returns the text in the range [`start`,`end`). Excludes undisplayed
text (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) if
`include_hidden_chars` is `false`. Does not include characters
representing embedded images, so byte and character indexes into
the returned string do not correspond to byte
and character indexes into the buffer. Contrast with
`TextBufferExt::get_slice`.
## `start`
start of a range
## `end`
end of a range
## `include_hidden_chars`
whether to include invisible text

# Returns

an allocated UTF-8 string
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert -->
Inserts `len` bytes of `text` at position `iter`. If `len` is -1,
`text` must be nul-terminated and will be inserted in its
entirety. Emits the “insert-text” signal; insertion actually occurs
in the default handler for the signal. `iter` is invalidated when
insertion occurs (because the buffer contents change), but the
default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
inserted text.
## `iter`
a position in the buffer
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_at_cursor -->
Simply calls `TextBufferExt::insert`, using the current
cursor position as the insertion point.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text, in bytes
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_child_anchor -->
Inserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at `iter`. The
anchor will be counted as one character in character counts, and
when obtaining the buffer contents as a string, will be represented
by the Unicode “object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the
“slice” variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string
include this character for child anchors, but the “text” variants do
not. E.g. see `TextBufferExt::get_slice` and
`TextBufferExt::get_text`. Consider
`TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor` as a more convenient
alternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference to
the anchor, so you can unref it after insertion.
## `iter`
location to insert the anchor
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_interactive -->
Like `TextBufferExt::insert`, but the insertion will not occur if
`iter` is at a non-editable location in the buffer. Usually you
want to prevent insertions at ineditable locations if the insertion
results from a user action (is interactive).

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `text`
some UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_interactive_at_cursor -->
Calls `TextBufferExt::insert_interactive` at the cursor
position.

`default_editable` indicates the editability of text that doesn't
have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
result of `TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `text`
text in UTF-8 format
## `len`
length of text in bytes, or -1
## `default_editable`
default editability of buffer

# Returns

whether text was actually inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_markup -->
Inserts the text in `markup` at position `iter`. `markup` will be inserted
in its entirety and must be nul-terminated and valid UTF-8. Emits the
`TextBuffer::insert-text` signal, possibly multiple times; insertion
actually occurs in the default handler for the signal. `iter` will point
to the end of the inserted text on return.
## `iter`
location to insert the markup
## `markup`
a nul-terminated UTF-8 string containing [Pango markup][PangoMarkupFormat]
## `len`
length of `markup` in bytes, or -1
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_paintable -->
Inserts an image into the text buffer at `iter`. The image will be
counted as one character in character counts, and when obtaining
the buffer contents as a string, will be represented by the Unicode
“object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the “slice”
variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string include
this character for paintable, but the “text” variants do
not. e.g. see `TextBufferExt::get_slice` and
`TextBufferExt::get_text`.
## `iter`
location to insert the paintable
## `paintable`
a `gdk::Paintable`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_range -->
Copies text, tags, and paintables between `start` and `end` (the order
of `start` and `end` doesn’t matter) and inserts the copy at `iter`.
Used instead of simply getting/inserting text because it preserves
images and tags. If `start` and `end` are in a different buffer from
`self`, the two buffers must share the same tag table.

Implemented via emissions of the insert_text and apply_tag signals,
so expect those.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_range_interactive -->
Same as `TextBufferExt::insert_range`, but does nothing if the
insertion point isn’t editable. The `default_editable` parameter
indicates whether the text is editable at `iter` if no tags
enclosing `iter` affect editability. Typically the result of
`TextViewExt::get_editable` is appropriate here.
## `iter`
a position in `self`
## `start`
a position in a `TextBuffer`
## `end`
another position in the same buffer as `start`
## `default_editable`
default editability of the buffer

# Returns

whether an insertion was possible at `iter`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_with_tags -->
Inserts `text` into `self` at `iter`, applying the list of tags to
the newly-inserted text. The last tag specified must be `None` to
terminate the list. Equivalent to calling `TextBufferExt::insert`,
then `TextBufferExt::apply_tag` on the inserted text;
`TextBufferExt::insert_with_tags` is just a convenience function.
## `iter`
an iterator in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag`
first tag to apply to `text`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn insert_with_tags_by_name -->
Same as `TextBufferExt::insert_with_tags`, but allows you
to pass in tag names instead of tag objects.
## `iter`
position in `self`
## `text`
UTF-8 text
## `len`
length of `text`, or -1
## `first_tag_name`
name of a tag to apply to `text`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn move_mark -->
Moves `mark` to the new location `where_`. Emits the `TextBuffer::mark-set`
signal as notification of the move.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `where_`
new location for `mark` in `self`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn move_mark_by_name -->
Moves the mark named `name` (which must exist) to location `where_`.
See `TextBufferExt::move_mark` for details.
## `name`
name of a mark
## `where_`
new location for mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn paste_clipboard -->
Pastes the contents of a clipboard. If `override_location` is `None`, the
pasted text will be inserted at the cursor position, or the buffer selection
will be replaced if the selection is non-empty.

Note: pasting is asynchronous, that is, we’ll ask for the paste data and
return, and at some point later after the main loop runs, the paste data will
be inserted.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` to paste from
## `override_location`
location to insert pasted text, or `None`
## `default_editable`
whether the buffer is editable by default
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn place_cursor -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them to the same place in two steps
with `TextBufferExt::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `where_`
where to put the cursor
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn redo -->
Redoes the next redoable action on the buffer, if there is one.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_all_tags -->
Removes all tags in the range between `start` and `end`. Be careful
with this function; it could remove tags added in code unrelated to
the code you’re currently writing. That is, using this function is
probably a bad idea if you have two or more unrelated code sections
that add tags.
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_selection_clipboard -->
Removes a `gdk::Clipboard` added with
`TextBufferExt::add_selection_clipboard`.
## `clipboard`
a `gdk::Clipboard` added to `self` by
 `TextBufferExt::add_selection_clipboard`
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_tag -->
Emits the “remove-tag” signal. The default handler for the signal
removes all occurrences of `tag` from the given range. `start` and
`end` don’t have to be in order.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn remove_tag_by_name -->
Calls `TextTagTable::lookup` on the buffer’s tag table to
get a `TextTag`, then calls `TextBufferExt::remove_tag`.
## `name`
name of a `TextTag`
## `start`
one bound of range to be untagged
## `end`
other bound of range to be untagged
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn select_range -->
This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
simultaneously. If you move them in two steps
with `TextBufferExt::move_mark`, you will temporarily select a
region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
be optimized.
## `ins`
where to put the “insert” mark
## `bound`
where to put the “selection_bound” mark
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_enable_undo -->
Sets whether or not to enable undoable actions in the text buffer. If
enabled, the user will be able to undo the last number of actions up to
`TextBufferExt::get_max_undo_levels`.

See `TextBufferExt::begin_irreversible_action` and
`TextBufferExt::end_irreversible_action` to create changes to the buffer
that cannot be undone.
## `enable_undo`
`true` to enable undo
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_max_undo_levels -->
Sets the maximum number of undo levels to perform. If 0, unlimited undo
actions may be performed. Note that this may have a memory usage impact
as it requires storing an additional copy of the inserted or removed text
within the text buffer.
## `max_undo_levels`
the maximum number of undo actions to perform
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_modified -->
Used to keep track of whether the buffer has been modified since the
last time it was saved. Whenever the buffer is saved to disk, call
gtk_text_buffer_set_modified (`self`, FALSE). When the buffer is modified,
it will automatically toggled on the modified bit again. When the modified
bit flips, the buffer emits the `TextBuffer::modified-changed` signal.
## `setting`
modification flag setting
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_text -->
Deletes current contents of `self`, and inserts `text` instead. If
`len` is -1, `text` must be nul-terminated. `text` must be valid UTF-8.
## `text`
UTF-8 text to insert
## `len`
length of `text` in bytes
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn undo -->
Undoes the last undoable action on the buffer, if there is one.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_apply_tag -->
The `TextBuffer::apply-tag` signal is emitted to apply a tag to a
range of text in a `TextBuffer`.
Applying actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).
The default signal handler revalidates the `start` and `end` iters to
both point to the location where text was deleted. Handlers
which run after the default handler (see `g_signal_connect_after`)

<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_insert_child_anchor -->
The `TextBuffer::insert-child-anchor` signal is emitted to insert a
`TextChildAnchor` in a `TextBuffer`.
Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must
not invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).

The `TextBuffer::insert-paintable` signal is emitted to insert a `gdk::Paintable`
in a `TextBuffer`. Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).
The default signal handler revalidates it to be placed after the
inserted `paintable`.

See also: `TextBufferExt::insert_paintable`.
## `location`
position to insert `paintable` in `textbuffer`
## `paintable`
the `gdk::Paintable` to be inserted
<!-- trait TextBufferExtManual::fn connect_insert_text -->
The ::insert-text signal is emitted to insert text in a `TextBuffer`.
Insertion actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `location` iter (or has to revalidate it).
The default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
inserted text.

after a `TextMark` is deleted.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark`.
## `mark`
The mark that was deleted
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_mark_set -->
The `TextBuffer::mark-set` signal is emitted as notification
after a `TextMark` is set.

<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_modified_changed -->
The `TextBuffer::modified-changed` signal is emitted when the modified bit of a
`TextBuffer` flips.

See also:
`TextBufferExt::set_modified`.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_paste_done -->
The paste-done signal is emitted after paste operation has been completed.
This is useful to properly scroll the view to the end of the pasted text.
See `TextBufferExt::paste_clipboard` for more details.
## `clipboard`
the `gdk::Clipboard` pasted from
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_redo -->
The "redo" signal is emitted when a request has been made to redo the
previously undone operation.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_remove_tag -->
The `TextBuffer::remove-tag` signal is emitted to remove all occurrences
of `tag` from a range of text in a `TextBuffer`.
Removal actually occurs in the default handler.

Note that if your handler runs before the default handler it must not
invalidate the `start` and `end` iters (or has to revalidate them).

the tag to be removed
## `start`
the start of the range the tag is removed from

<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn connect_undo -->
The "undo" signal is emitted when a request has been made to undo the
previous operation or set of operations that have been grouped together.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_can_redo -->
The `TextBuffer:can-redo` property denotes that the buffer can reapply the
last undone action.

The `TextBuffer:can-undo` property denotes that the buffer can undo the last
applied action.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_cursor_position -->
The position of the insert mark (as offset from the beginning
of the buffer). It is useful for getting notified when the
cursor moves.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn get_property_enable_undo -->
The `TextBuffer:enable-undo` property denotes if support for undoing and
redoing changes to the buffer is allowed.

The text content of the buffer. Without child widgets and images,
see `TextBufferExt::get_text` for more information.
<!-- trait TextBufferExt::fn set_property_text -->
The text content of the buffer. Without child widgets and images,
see `TextBufferExt::get_text` for more information.
<!-- struct TextChildAnchor -->
A `TextChildAnchor` is a spot in the buffer where child widgets can
be “anchored” (inserted inline, as if they were characters). The anchor
can have multiple widgets anchored, to allow for multiple views.

# Implements

[`TextChildAnchorExt`](trait.TextChildAnchorExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt -->
Trait containing all `TextChildAnchor` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextChildAnchor`](struct.TextChildAnchor.html)
<!-- impl TextChildAnchor::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextChildAnchor`. Usually you would then insert
it into a `TextBuffer` with `TextBufferExt::insert_child_anchor`.
To perform the creation and insertion in one step, use the
convenience function `TextBufferExt::create_child_anchor`.

# Returns

a new `TextChildAnchor`
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt::fn get_deleted -->
Determines whether a child anchor has been deleted from
the buffer. Keep in mind that the child anchor will be
unreferenced when removed from the buffer, so you need to
hold your own reference (with `gobject::ObjectExt::ref`) if you plan
to use this function — otherwise all deleted child anchors
will also be finalized.

# Returns

`true` if the child anchor has been deleted from its buffer
<!-- trait TextChildAnchorExt::fn get_widgets -->
Gets a list of all widgets anchored at this child anchor.

The order in which the widgets are returned is not defined.
## `out_len`
return location for the length of the array

# Returns

an
 array of widgets anchored at `self`
<!-- enum TextDirection -->
Reading directions for text.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant None -->
No direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Ltr -->
Left to right text direction.
<!-- enum TextDirection::variant Rtl -->
Right to left text direction.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection -->
Granularity types that extend the text selection. Use the
`TextView::extend-selection` signal to customize the selection.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Word -->
Selects the current word. It is triggered by
 a double-click for example.
<!-- enum TextExtendSelection::variant Line -->
Selects the current line. It is triggered by
 a triple-click for example.
<!-- struct TextIter -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn assign -->
Assigns the value of `other` to `self`. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be assigned
with `GtkTextIter i = j;`. The
function is used by language bindings.
## `other`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_char -->
Moves backward by one character offset. Returns `true` if movement
was possible; if `self` was the first in the buffer (character
offset 0), `TextIter::backward_char` returns `false` for convenience when
writing loops.

# Returns

whether movement was possible
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_position -->
Like `TextIter::forward_cursor_position`, but moves backward.

# Returns

`true` if we moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_find_char -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_find_char`, but goes backward from `self`.
## `pred`
function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_search -->
Same as `TextIter::forward_search`, but moves backward.

`match_end` will never be set to a `TextIter` located after `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_start` before or at `self`.
## `str`
search string
## `flags`
bitmask of flags affecting the search
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_start`, or `None` for start of buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_start -->
Moves backward to the previous sentence start; if `self` is already at
the start of a sentence, moves backward to the next one. Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_sentence_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_sentence_start` up to `count` times,
or until it returns `false`. If `count` is negative, moves forward
instead of backward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves backward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles before `self`. Sets `self`
to the location of the toggle, or the start of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle before `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the previous visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::backward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the previous visible line. Returns `true` if
`self` could be moved; i.e. if `self` was at character offset 0, this
function returns `false`. Therefore if `self` was already on line 0,
but not at the start of the line, `self` is snapped to the start of
the line and the function returns `true`. (Note that this implies that
in a loop calling this function, the line number may not change on
every iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)

# Returns

whether `self` moved
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines backward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves forward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move backward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous visible word start. (If `self` is currently
on a word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_visible_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_visible_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_start -->
Moves backward to the previous word start. (If `self` is currently on a
word start, moves backward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn backward_word_starts -->
Calls `TextIter::backward_word_start` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn can_insert -->
Considering the default editability of the buffer, and tags that
affect editability, determines whether text inserted at `self` would
be editable. If text inserted at `self` would be editable then the
user should be allowed to insert text at `self`.
`TextBufferExt::insert_interactive` uses this function to decide
whether insertions are allowed at a given position.
## `default_editability`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether text inserted at `self` would be editable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn compare -->
A `qsort`-style function that returns negative if `self` is less than
`rhs`, positive if `self` is greater than `rhs`, and 0 if they’re equal.
Ordering is in character offset order, i.e. the first character in the buffer
is less than the second character in the buffer.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

-1 if `self` is less than `rhs`, 1 if `self` is greater, 0 if they are equal
<!-- impl TextIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically-allocated copy of an iterator. This function
is not useful in applications, because iterators can be copied with a
simple assignment (`GtkTextIter i = j;`). The
function is used by language bindings.

# Returns

a copy of the `self`, free with `TextIter::free`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn editable -->
Returns whether the character at `self` is within an editable region
of text.

Non-editable text is “locked” and can’t be changed by the
user via `TextView`. If no tags applied to this text affect
editability, `default_setting` will be returned.

You don’t want to use this function to decide whether text can be
inserted at `self`, because for insertion you don’t want to know
whether the char at `self` is inside an editable range, you want to
know whether a new character inserted at `self` would be inside an
editable range. Use `TextIter::can_insert` to handle this
case.
## `default_setting`
`true` if text is editable by default

# Returns

whether `self` is inside an editable range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to the start of the paragraph
delimiter characters for a line (delimiters will be either a
newline, a carriage return, a carriage return followed by a
newline, or a Unicode paragraph separator character). Note that an
iterator pointing to the \n of a \r\n pair will not be counted as
the end of a line, the line ends before the \r. The end iterator is
considered to be at the end of a line, even though there are no
paragraph delimiter chars there.

# Returns

whether `self` is at the end of a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` ends a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled off at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled off at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the end of the tagged range, but that the character
at `self` is outside the tagged range. In other words,
unlike `TextIter::starts_tag`, if `TextIter::ends_tag` returns `true`,
`TextIter::has_tag` will return `false` for the same parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the end of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn ends_word -->
Determines whether `self` ends a natural-language word. Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the end of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn equal -->
Tests whether two iterators are equal, using the fastest possible
mechanism. This function is very fast; you can expect it to perform
better than e.g. getting the character offset for each iterator and
comparing the offsets yourself. Also, it’s a bit faster than
`TextIter::compare`.
## `rhs`
another `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if the iterators point to the same place in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_char -->
Moves `self` forward by one character offset. Note that images
embedded in the buffer occupy 1 character slot, so
`TextIter::forward_char` may actually move onto an image instead
of a character, if you have images in your buffer. If `self` is the
end iterator or one character before it, `self` will now point at
the end iterator, and `TextIter::forward_char` returns `false` for
convenience when writing loops.

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_chars -->
Moves `count` characters if possible (if `count` would move past the
start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of the
buffer). The return value indicates whether the new position of
`self` is different from its original position, and dereferenceable
(the last iterator in the buffer is not dereferenceable). If `count`
is 0, the function does nothing and returns `false`.
## `count`
number of characters to move, may be negative

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward by a single cursor position. Cursor positions
are (unsurprisingly) positions where the cursor can appear. Perhaps
surprisingly, there may not be a cursor position between all
characters. The most common example for European languages would be
a carriage return/newline sequence. For some Unicode characters,
the equivalent of say the letter “a” with an accent mark will be
represented as two characters, first the letter then a "combining
mark" that causes the accent to be rendered; so the cursor can’t go
between those two characters. See also the `pango::LogAttr`-struct and
`pango_break` function.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_find_char -->
Advances `self`, calling `pred` on each character. If
`pred` returns `true`, returns `true` and stops scanning.
If `pred` never returns `true`, `self` is set to `limit` if
`limit` is non-`None`, otherwise to the end iterator.
## `pred`
a function to be called on each character
## `user_data`
user data for `pred`
## `limit`
search limit, or `None` for none

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next line. If the iter is already on the
last line of the buffer, moves the iter to the end of the current line.
If after the operation, the iter is at the end of the buffer and not
dereferenceable, returns `false`. Otherwise, returns `true`.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_lines -->
Moves `count` lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_search -->
Searches forward for `str`. Any match is returned by setting
`match_start` to the first character of the match and `match_end` to the
first character after the match. The search will not continue past
`limit`. Note that a search is a linear or O(n) operation, so you
may wish to use `limit` to avoid locking up your UI on large
buffers.

`match_start` will never be set to a `TextIter` located before `self`, even if
there is a possible `match_end` after or at `self`.
## `str`
a search string
## `flags`
flags affecting how the search is done
## `match_start`
return location for start of match, or `None`
## `match_end`
return location for end of match, or `None`
## `limit`
location of last possible `match_end`, or `None` for the end of the buffer

# Returns

whether a match was found
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_end -->
Moves forward to the next sentence end. (If `self` is at the end of
a sentence, moves to the next end of sentence.) Sentence
boundaries are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly
any language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text
boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_sentence_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_sentence_end` `count` times (or until
`TextIter::forward_sentence_end` returns `false`). If `count` is
negative, moves backward instead of forward.
## `count`
number of sentences to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_end -->
Moves `self` forward to the “end iterator,” which points one past the last
valid character in the buffer. `TextIter::get_char` called on the
end iterator returns 0, which is convenient for writing loops.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_line_end -->
Moves the iterator to point to the paragraph delimiter characters,
which will be either a newline, a carriage return, a carriage
return/newline in sequence, or the Unicode paragraph separator
character. If the iterator is already at the paragraph delimiter
characters, moves to the paragraph delimiter characters for the
next line. If `self` is on the last line in the buffer, which does
not end in paragraph delimiters, moves to the end iterator (end of
the last line), and returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new location is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_to_tag_toggle -->
Moves forward to the next toggle (on or off) of the
`TextTag` `tag`, or to the next toggle of any tag if
`tag` is `None`. If no matching tag toggles are found,
returns `false`, otherwise `true`. Does not return toggles
located at `self`, only toggles after `self`. Sets `self` to
the location of the toggle, or to the end of the buffer
if no toggle is found.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether we found a tag toggle after `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_position -->
Moves `self` forward to the next visible cursor position. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_cursor_positions -->
Moves up to `count` visible cursor positions. See
`TextIter::forward_cursor_position` for details.
## `count`
number of positions to move

# Returns

`true` if we moved and the new position is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_line -->
Moves `self` to the start of the next visible line. Returns `true` if there
was a next line to move to, and `false` if `self` was simply moved to
the end of the buffer and is now not dereferenceable, or if `self` was
already at the end of the buffer.

# Returns

whether `self` can be dereferenced
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_lines -->
Moves `count` visible lines forward, if possible (if `count` would move
past the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of
the buffer). The return value indicates whether the iterator moved
onto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn’t move, or
moved onto the end iterator, then `false` is returned. If `count` is 0,
the function does nothing and returns `false`. If `count` is negative,
moves backward by 0 - `count` lines.
## `count`
number of lines to move forward

# Returns

whether `self` moved and is dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next visible word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_visible_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_visible_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_end -->
Moves forward to the next word end. (If `self` is currently on a
word end, moves forward to the next one after that.) Word breaks
are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn forward_word_ends -->
Calls `TextIter::forward_word_end` up to `count` times.
## `count`
number of times to move

# Returns

`true` if `self` moved and is not the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn free -->
Free an iterator allocated on the heap. This function
is intended for use in language bindings, and is not
especially useful for applications, because iterators can
simply be allocated on the stack.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` this iterator is associated with.

# Returns

the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_bytes_in_line -->
Returns the number of bytes in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of bytes in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_char -->
The Unicode character at this iterator is returned. (Equivalent to
operator* on a C++ iterator.) If the element at this iterator is a
non-character element, such as an image embedded in the buffer, the
Unicode “unknown” character 0xFFFC is returned. If invoked on
the end iterator, zero is returned; zero is not a valid Unicode character.
So you can write a loop which ends when `TextIter::get_char`
returns 0.

# Returns

a Unicode character, or 0 if `self` is not dereferenceable
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_chars_in_line -->
Returns the number of characters in the line containing `self`,
including the paragraph delimiters.

# Returns

number of characters in the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_child_anchor -->
If the location at `self` contains a child anchor, the
anchor is returned (with no new reference count added). Otherwise,
`None` is returned.

# Returns

the anchor at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_language -->
Returns the language in effect at `self`.

If no tags affecting language apply to `self`, the return
value is identical to that of `gtk_get_default_language`.

# Returns

language in effect at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line -->
Returns the line number containing the iterator. Lines in
a `TextBuffer` are numbered beginning with 0 for the first
line in the buffer.

# Returns

a line number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_index -->
Returns the byte index of the iterator, counting
from the start of a newline-terminated line.
Remember that `TextBuffer` encodes text in
UTF-8, and that characters can require a variable
number of bytes to represent.

# Returns

distance from start of line, in bytes
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_line_offset -->
Returns the character offset of the iterator,
counting from the start of a newline-terminated line.
The first character on the line has offset 0.

# Returns

offset from start of line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_marks -->
Returns a list of all `TextMark` at this location. Because marks
are not iterable (they don’t take up any "space" in the buffer,
they are just marks in between iterable locations), multiple marks
can exist in the same place. The returned list is not in any
meaningful order.

# Returns

list of `TextMark`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_offset -->
Returns the character offset of an iterator.
Each character in a `TextBuffer` has an offset,
starting with 0 for the first character in the buffer.
Use `TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_offset` to convert an
offset back into an iterator.

# Returns

a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_paintable -->
If the element at `self` is a paintable, the paintable is returned
(with no new reference count added). Otherwise, `None` is returned.

# Returns

the paintable at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_slice -->
Returns the text in the given range. A “slice” is an array of
characters encoded in UTF-8 format, including the Unicode “unknown”
character 0xFFFC for iterable non-character elements in the buffer,
such as images. Because images are encoded in the slice, byte and
character offsets in the returned array will correspond to byte
offsets in the text buffer. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal
text as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a paintable or
widget is in the buffer.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_tags -->
Returns a list of tags that apply to `self`, in ascending order of
priority (highest-priority tags are last). The `TextTag` in the
list don’t have a reference added, but you have to free the list
itself.

# Returns

list of `TextTag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_text -->
Returns text in the given range. If the range
contains non-text elements such as images, the character and byte
offsets in the returned string will not correspond to character and
byte offsets in the buffer. If you want offsets to correspond, see
`TextIter::get_slice`.
## `end`
iterator at end of a range

# Returns

array of characters from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_toggled_tags -->
Returns a list of `TextTag` that are toggled on or off at this
point. (If `toggled_on` is `true`, the list contains tags that are
toggled on.) If a tag is toggled on at `self`, then some non-empty
range of characters following `self` has that tag applied to it. If
a tag is toggled off, then some non-empty range following `self`
does not have the tag applied to it.
## `toggled_on`
`true` to get toggled-on tags

# Returns

tags toggled at this point
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_index -->
Returns the number of bytes from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting bytes that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

byte index of `self` with respect to the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_line_offset -->
Returns the offset in characters from the start of the
line to the given `self`, not counting characters that
are invisible due to tags with the “invisible” flag
toggled on.

# Returns

offset in visible characters from the start of the line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_slice -->
Like `TextIter::get_slice`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

slice of text from the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn get_visible_text -->
Like `TextIter::get_text`, but invisible text is not included.
Invisible text is usually invisible because a `TextTag` with the
“invisible” attribute turned on has been applied to it.
## `end`
iterator at end of range

# Returns

string containing visible text in the
range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn has_tag -->
Returns `true` if `self` points to a character that is part of a range tagged
with `tag`. See also `TextIter::starts_tag` and `TextIter::ends_tag`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`

# Returns

whether `self` is tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn in_range -->
Checks whether `self` falls in the range [`start`, `end`).
`start` and `end` must be in ascending order.
## `start`
start of range
## `end`
end of range

# Returns

`true` if `self` is in the range
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` is inside a sentence (as opposed to in
between two sentences, e.g. after a period and before the first
letter of the next sentence). Sentence boundaries are determined
by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language (if not, the
correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn inside_word -->
Determines whether the character pointed by `self` is part of a
natural-language word (as opposed to say inside some whitespace). Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break algorithms).

Note that if `TextIter::starts_word` returns `true`, then this function
returns `true` too, since `self` points to the first character of the word.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is inside a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_cursor_position -->
See `TextIter::forward_cursor_position` or `pango::LogAttr` or
`pango_break` for details on what a cursor position is.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor can be placed at `self`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_end -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the end iterator, i.e. one past the last
dereferenceable iterator in the buffer. `TextIter::is_end` is
the most efficient way to check whether an iterator is the end
iterator.

# Returns

whether `self` is the end iterator
<!-- impl TextIter::fn is_start -->
Returns `true` if `self` is the first iterator in the buffer, that is
if `self` has a character offset of 0.

# Returns

whether `self` is the first in the buffer
<!-- impl TextIter::fn order -->
Swaps the value of `self` and `second` if `second` comes before
`self` in the buffer. That is, ensures that `self` and `second` are
in sequence. Most text buffer functions that take a range call this
automatically on your behalf, so there’s no real reason to call it yourself
in those cases. There are some exceptions, such as `TextIter::in_range`,
that expect a pre-sorted range.
## `second`
another `TextIter`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line -->
Moves iterator `self` to the start of the line `line_number`. If
`line_number` is negative or larger than the number of lines in the
buffer, moves `self` to the start of the last line in the buffer.
## `line_number`
line number (counted from 0)
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_index -->
Same as `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but works with a
byte index. The given byte index must be at
the start of a character, it can’t be in the middle of a UTF-8
encoded character.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_line_offset -->
Moves `self` within a line, to a new character
(not byte) offset. The given character offset must be less than or
equal to the number of characters in the line; if equal, `self`
moves to the start of the next line. See
`TextIter::set_line_index` if you have a byte index rather than
a character offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset relative to the start of `self`’s current line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_offset -->
Sets `self` to point to `char_offset`. `char_offset` counts from the start
of the entire text buffer, starting with 0.
## `char_offset`
a character number
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_index -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_index`, but the index is in visible
bytes, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not counted
in the index.
## `byte_on_line`
a byte index
<!-- impl TextIter::fn set_visible_line_offset -->
Like `TextIter::set_line_offset`, but the offset is in visible
characters, i.e. text with a tag making it invisible is not
counted in the offset.
## `char_on_line`
a character offset
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_line -->
Returns `true` if `self` begins a paragraph,
i.e. if `TextIter::get_line_offset` would return 0.
However this function is potentially more efficient than
`TextIter::get_line_offset` because it doesn’t have to compute
the offset, it just has to see whether it’s 0.

# Returns

whether `self` begins a line
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_sentence -->
Determines whether `self` begins a sentence. Sentence boundaries are
determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any language
(if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango text boundary
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a sentence.
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_tag -->
Returns `true` if `tag` is toggled on at exactly this point. If `tag`
is `None`, returns `true` if any tag is toggled on at this point.

Note that if `TextIter::starts_tag` returns `true`, it means that `self` is
at the beginning of the tagged range, and that the
character at `self` is inside the tagged range. In other
words, unlike `TextIter::ends_tag`, if `TextIter::starts_tag` returns
`true`, `TextIter::has_tag` will also return `true` for the same
parameters.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `self` is the start of a range tagged with `tag`
<!-- impl TextIter::fn starts_word -->
Determines whether `self` begins a natural-language word. Word
breaks are determined by Pango and should be correct for nearly any
language (if not, the correct fix would be to the Pango word break
algorithms).

# Returns

`true` if `self` is at the start of a word
<!-- impl TextIter::fn toggles_tag -->
This is equivalent to (`TextIter::starts_tag` ||
`TextIter::ends_tag`), i.e. it tells you whether a range with
`tag` applied to it begins or ends at `self`.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`, or `None`

# Returns

whether `tag` is toggled on or off at `self`
<!-- struct TextMark -->
You may wish to begin by reading the
[text widget conceptual overview][TextWidget]
which gives an overview of all the objects and data
types related to the text widget and how they work together.

A `TextMark` is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in
the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
`TextBufferExt::get_iter_at_mark`. Unlike iterators, marks remain valid across
buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or
deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the
position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a
mark, a mark with “left gravity” will be moved to the
beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with “right
gravity” will be moved to the end.

Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
displayed.

Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the validity
of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at any time with
`TextBufferExt::delete_mark`. Once deleted from the buffer, a mark is
essentially useless.

Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the
`TextMark` object around.

Marks are typically created using the `TextBufferExt::create_mark` function.

# Implements

[`TextMarkExt`](trait.TextMarkExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait TextMarkExt -->
Trait containing all `TextMark` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextMark`](struct.TextMark.html)
<!-- impl TextMark::fn new -->
Creates a text mark. Add it to a buffer using `TextBufferExt::add_mark`.
If `name` is `None`, the mark is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be
retrieved by name using `TextBufferExt::get_mark`. If a mark has left
gravity, and text is inserted at the mark’s current location, the mark
will be moved to the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has
right gravity (`left_gravity` = `false`), the mark will end up on the
right of newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a
mark with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
side of the text you’re typing).
## `name`
mark name or `None`
## `left_gravity`
whether the mark should have left gravity

# Returns

new `TextMark`
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_buffer -->
Gets the buffer this mark is located inside,
or `None` if the mark is deleted.

# Returns

the mark’s `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_deleted -->
Returns `true` if the mark has been removed from its buffer
with `TextBufferExt::delete_mark`. See `TextBufferExt::add_mark`
for a way to add it to a buffer again.

# Returns

whether the mark is deleted
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_left_gravity -->
Determines whether the mark has left gravity.

# Returns

`true` if the mark has left gravity, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_name -->
Returns the mark name; returns NULL for anonymous marks.

# Returns

mark name
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_visible -->
Returns `true` if the mark is visible (i.e. a cursor is displayed
for it).

# Returns

`true` if visible
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_property_left_gravity -->
Whether the mark has left gravity. When text is inserted at the mark’s
current location, if the mark has left gravity it will be moved
to the left of the newly-inserted text, otherwise to the right.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn set_property_left_gravity -->
Whether the mark has left gravity. When text is inserted at the mark’s
current location, if the mark has left gravity it will be moved
to the left of the newly-inserted text, otherwise to the right.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn get_property_name -->
The name of the mark or `None` if the mark is anonymous.
<!-- trait TextMarkExt::fn set_property_name -->
The name of the mark or `None` if the mark is anonymous.
<!-- struct TextSearchFlags -->
Flags affecting how a search is done.

If neither `TextSearchFlags::VisibleOnly` nor `TextSearchFlags::TextOnly` are
enabled, the match must be exact; the special 0xFFFC character will match
embedded paintables or child widgets.
<!-- struct TextSearchFlags::const VISIBLE_ONLY -->
Search only visible data. A search match may
have invisible text interspersed.
<!-- struct TextSearchFlags::const TEXT_ONLY -->
Search only text. A match may have paintables or
child widgets mixed inside the matched range.
<!-- struct TextSearchFlags::const CASE_INSENSITIVE -->
The text will be matched regardless of
what case it is in.

Tags should be in the `TextTagTable` for a given `TextBuffer`
before using them with that buffer.

`TextBufferExt::create_tag` is the best way to create tags.
See “gtk4-demo” for numerous examples.

For each property of `TextTag`, there is a “set” property, e.g.
“font-set” corresponds to “font”. These “set” properties reflect
whether a property has been set or not.
They are maintained by GTK+ and you should not set them independently.

# Implements

[`TextTagExt`](trait.TextTagExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait TextTagExt -->
Trait containing all `TextTag` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextTag`](struct.TextTag.html)
<!-- impl TextTag::fn new -->
Creates a `TextTag`. Configure the tag using object arguments,
i.e. using `gobject::ObjectExt::set`.
## `name`
tag name, or `None`

# Returns

a new `TextTag`
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn changed -->
Emits the `TextTagTable::tag-changed` signal on the `TextTagTable` where
the tag is included.

The signal is already emitted when setting a `TextTag` property. This
function is useful for a `TextTag` subclass.
## `size_changed`
whether the change affects the `TextView` layout.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_priority -->
Get the tag priority.

# Returns

The tag’s priority.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_priority -->
Sets the priority of a `TextTag`. Valid priorities
start at 0 and go to one less than `TextTagTable::get_size`.
Each tag in a table has a unique priority; setting the priority
of one tag shifts the priorities of all the other tags in the
table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. Higher priority
tags “win” if two tags both set the same text attribute. When adding
a tag to a tag table, it will be assigned the highest priority in
the table by default; so normally the precedence of a set of tags
is the order in which they were added to the table, or created with
`TextBufferExt::create_tag`, which adds the tag to the buffer’s table
automatically.
## `priority`
the new priority
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_accumulative_margin -->
Whether the margins accumulate or override each other.

When set to `true` the margins of this tag are added to the margins
of any other non-accumulative margins present. When set to `false`
the margins override one another (the default).
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_accumulative_margin -->
Whether the margins accumulate or override each other.

When set to `true` the margins of this tag are added to the margins
of any other non-accumulative margins present. When set to `false`
the margins override one another (the default).

Background color as a `gdk::RGBA`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_background_rgba -->
Background color as a `gdk::RGBA`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_fallback -->
Whether font fallback is enabled.

When set to `true`, other fonts will be substituted
where the current font is missing glyphs.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_fallback -->
Whether font fallback is enabled.

When set to `true`, other fonts will be substituted
where the current font is missing glyphs.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_font -->
Font description as string, e.g. \"Sans Italic 12\".

Note that the initial value of this property depends on
the internals of `pango::FontDescription`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_font -->
Font description as string, e.g. \"Sans Italic 12\".

Note that the initial value of this property depends on
the internals of `pango::FontDescription`.

OpenType font features, as a string.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_foreground_rgba -->
Foreground color as a `gdk::RGBA`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_foreground_rgba -->
Foreground color as a `gdk::RGBA`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_invisible -->
Whether this text is hidden.

Note that there may still be problems with the support for invisible
text, in particular when navigating programmatically inside a buffer
containing invisible segments.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_invisible -->
Whether this text is hidden.

Note that there may still be problems with the support for invisible
text, in particular when navigating programmatically inside a buffer
containing invisible segments.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_language -->
The language this text is in, as an ISO code. Pango can use this as a
hint when rendering the text. If not set, an appropriate default will be
used.

Note that the initial value of this property depends on the current
locale, see also `gtk_get_default_language`.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_language -->
The language this text is in, as an ISO code. Pango can use this as a
hint when rendering the text. If not set, an appropriate default will be
used.

Note that the initial value of this property depends on the current
locale, see also `gtk_get_default_language`.

This property modifies the color of strikeouts. If not set, strikeouts
will use the foreground color.

If the `TextTag:strikethrough-rgba` property has been set.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn get_property_underline_rgba -->
This property modifies the color of underlines. If not set, underlines
will use the foreground color.

If `TextTag:underline` is set to `pango::Underline::Error`, an alternate
color may be applied instead of the foreground. Setting this property
will always override those defaults.
<!-- trait TextTagExt::fn set_property_underline_rgba -->
This property modifies the color of underlines. If not set, underlines
will use the foreground color.

If `TextTag:underline` is set to `pango::Underline::Error`, an alternate
color may be applied instead of the foreground. Setting this property
will always override those defaults.

# `GtkTextTagTables` as `Buildable`

The `TextTagTable` implementation of the `Buildable` interface
supports adding tags by specifying “tag” as the “type” attribute
of a `<child>` element.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying tags:

```text
<object class="GtkTextTagTable">
 <child type="tag">
   <object class="GtkTextTag"/>
 </child>
</object>
```

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html)
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextTagTable`. The table contains no tags by
default.

# Returns

a new `TextTagTable`
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn add -->
Add a tag to the table. The tag is assigned the highest priority
in the table.

`tag` must not be in a tag table already, and may not have
the same name as an already-added tag.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`

# Returns

`true` on success.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn foreach -->
Calls `func` on each tag in `self`, with user data `data`.
Note that the table may not be modified while iterating
over it (you can’t add/remove tags).
## `func`
a function to call on each tag
## `data`
user data
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn get_size -->
Returns the size of the table (number of tags)

# Returns

number of tags in `self`
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn lookup -->
Look up a named tag.
## `name`
name of a tag

# Returns

The tag, or `None` if none by that
name is in the table.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn remove -->
Remove a tag from the table. If a `TextBuffer` has `self` as its tag table,
the tag is removed from the buffer. The table’s reference to the tag is
removed, so the tag will end up destroyed if you don’t have a reference to
it.
## `tag`
a `TextTag`
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn connect_tag_added -->
Emitted every time a new tag is added in the `TextTagTable`.
## `tag`
the added tag.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn connect_tag_changed -->
Emitted every time a tag in the `TextTagTable` changes.
## `tag`
the changed tag.
## `size_changed`
whether the change affects the `TextView` layout.
<!-- impl TextTagTable::fn connect_tag_removed -->
Emitted every time a tag is removed from the `TextTagTable`.

The `tag` is still valid by the time the signal is emitted, but
it is not associated with a tag table any more.
## `tag`
the removed tag.

`TextView` has a main css node with name textview and style class .view,
and subnodes for each of the border windows, and the main text area,
with names border and text, respectively. The border nodes each get
one of the style classes .left, .right, .top or .bottom.

A node representing the selection will appear below the text node.

If a context menu is opened, the window node will appear as a subnode
of the main node.

# Accessibility

`TextView` uses the `AccessibleRole::TextBox` role.

<!-- trait TextViewExt -->
Trait containing all `TextView` methods.

# Implementors

[`TextView`](struct.TextView.html)
<!-- impl TextView::fn new -->
Creates a new `TextView`. If you don’t call `TextViewExt::set_buffer`
before using the text view, an empty default buffer will be created
for you. Get the buffer with `TextViewExt::get_buffer`. If you want
to specify your own buffer, consider `TextView::new_with_buffer`.

# Returns

a new `TextView`
<!-- impl TextView::fn new_with_buffer -->
Creates a new `TextView` widget displaying the buffer
`buffer`. One buffer can be shared among many widgets.
`buffer` may be `None` to create a default buffer, in which case
this function is equivalent to `TextView::new`. The
text view adds its own reference count to the buffer; it does not
take over an existing reference.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`

# Returns

a new `TextView`.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn add_child_at_anchor -->
Adds a child widget in the text buffer, at the given `anchor`.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `anchor`
a `TextChildAnchor` in the `TextBuffer` for `self`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn add_overlay -->
Adds `child` at a fixed coordinate in the `TextView`'s text window. The
`xpos` and `ypos` must be in buffer coordinates (see
`TextViewExt::get_iter_location` to convert to buffer coordinates).

`child` will scroll with the text view.

If instead you want a widget that will not move with the `TextView`
contents see `Overlay`.
## `child`
a `Widget`
## `xpos`
X position of child in window coordinates
## `ypos`
Y position of child in window coordinates
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn backward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` backward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn backward_display_line_start -->
Moves the given `iter` backward to the next display line start.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn buffer_to_window_coords -->
Converts coordinate (`buffer_x`, `buffer_y`) to coordinates for the window
`win`, and stores the result in (`window_x`, `window_y`).
## `win`
a `TextWindowType`
## `buffer_x`
buffer x coordinate
## `buffer_y`
buffer y coordinate
## `window_x`
window x coordinate return location or `None`
## `window_y`
window y coordinate return location or `None`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn forward_display_line -->
Moves the given `iter` forward by one display (wrapped) line.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn forward_display_line_end -->
Moves the given `iter` forward to the next display line end.
A display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph. If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view’s width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the `TextBuffer`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` was moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_accepts_tab -->
Returns whether pressing the Tab key inserts a tab characters.
`TextViewExt::set_accepts_tab`.

# Returns

`true` if pressing the Tab key inserts a tab character,
 `false` if pressing the Tab key moves the keyboard focus.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_bottom_margin -->
Gets the bottom margin for text in the `self`.

# Returns

bottom margin in pixels
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_buffer -->
Returns the `TextBuffer` being displayed by this text view.
The reference count on the buffer is not incremented; the caller
of this function won’t own a new reference.

# Returns

a `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_cursor_locations -->
Given an `iter` within a text layout, determine the positions of the
strong and weak cursors if the insertion point is at that
iterator. The position of each cursor is stored as a zero-width
rectangle. The strong cursor location is the location where
characters of the directionality equal to the base direction of the
paragraph are inserted. The weak cursor location is the location
where characters of the directionality opposite to the base
direction of the paragraph are inserted.

If `iter` is `None`, the actual cursor position is used.

Note that if `iter` happens to be the actual cursor position, and
there is currently an IM preedit sequence being entered, the
returned locations will be adjusted to account for the preedit
cursor’s offset within the preedit sequence.

The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextViewExt::buffer_to_window_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `strong`
location to store the strong
 cursor position (may be `None`)
## `weak`
location to store the weak
 cursor position (may be `None`)
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_cursor_visible -->
Find out whether the cursor should be displayed.

# Returns

whether the insertion mark is visible
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_editable -->

<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_input_purpose -->
Gets the value of the `TextView:input-purpose` property.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_at_location -->
Retrieves the iterator at buffer coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer
coordinates are coordinates for the entire buffer, not just the
currently-displayed portion. If you have coordinates from an
event, you have to convert those to buffer coordinates with
`TextViewExt::window_to_buffer_coords`.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `x`
x position, in buffer coordinates
## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates

# Returns

`true` if the position is over text
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_at_position -->
Retrieves the iterator pointing to the character at buffer
coordinates `x` and `y`. Buffer coordinates are coordinates for
the entire buffer, not just the currently-displayed portion.
If you have coordinates from an event, you have to convert
those to buffer coordinates with
`TextViewExt::window_to_buffer_coords`.

Note that this is different from `TextViewExt::get_iter_at_location`,
which returns cursor locations, i.e. positions between
characters.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `trailing`
if non-`None`, location to store an integer indicating where
 in the grapheme the user clicked. It will either be
 zero, or the number of characters in the grapheme.

## `y`
y position, in buffer coordinates

# Returns

`true` if the position is over text
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_iter_location -->
Gets a rectangle which roughly contains the character at `iter`.
The rectangle position is in buffer coordinates; use
`TextViewExt::buffer_to_window_coords` to convert these
coordinates to coordinates for one of the windows in the text view.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `location`
bounds of the character at `iter`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_justification -->

is equal to the line space between each paragraph.

# Returns

default number of pixels above paragraphs
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn get_pixels_below_lines -->

Gets the line wrapping for the view.

# Returns

the line wrap setting
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn im_context_filter_keypress -->
Allow the `TextView` input method to internally handle key press
and release events. If this function returns `true`, then no further
processing should be done for this key event. See
`IMContext::filter_keypress`.

Note that you are expected to call this function from your handler
when overriding key event handling. This is needed in the case when
you need to insert your own key handling between the input method
and the default key event handling of the `TextView`.


```C
static gboolean
gtk_foo_bar_key_press_event (GtkWidget *widget,
                             GdkEvent  *event)
{
  guint keyval;
  
  gdk_event_get_keyval ((GdkEvent*)event, &keyval);

  if (keyval == GDK_KEY_Return || keyval == GDK_KEY_KP_Enter)
    {
      if (gtk_text_view_im_context_filter_keypress (GTK_TEXT_VIEW (widget), event))
        return TRUE;
    }

  // Do some stuff

  return GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (gtk_foo_bar_parent_class)->key_press_event (widget, event);
}
```
## `event`
the key event

# Returns

`true` if the input method handled the key event.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_mark_onscreen -->

`true` if the mark moved (wasn’t already onscreen)
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_overlay -->
Updates the position of a child, as for `TextViewExt::add_overlay`.
## `child`
a widget already added with `TextViewExt::add_overlay`
## `xpos`
new X position in buffer coordinates
## `ypos`
new Y position in buffer coordinates
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn move_visually -->
Move the iterator a given number of characters visually, treating
it as the strong cursor position. If `count` is positive, then the
new strong cursor position will be `count` positions to the right of
the old cursor position. If `count` is negative then the new strong
cursor position will be `count` positions to the left of the old
cursor position.

In the presence of bi-directional text, the correspondence
between logical and visual order will depend on the direction
of the current run, and there may be jumps when the cursor
is moved off of the end of a run.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `count`
number of characters to move (negative moves left,
 positive moves right)

# Returns

`true` if `iter` moved and is not on the end iterator
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn place_cursor_onscreen -->
Moves the cursor to the currently visible region of the
buffer, if it isn’t there already.

# Returns

`true` if the cursor had to be moved.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn remove -->
Removes a child widget from `self`.
## `child`
the child to remove
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn reset_cursor_blink -->
Ensures that the cursor is shown (i.e. not in an 'off' blink
interval) and resets the time that it will stay blinking (or
visible, in case blinking is disabled).

This function should be called in response to user input
(e.g. from derived classes that override the textview's
event handlers).
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn reset_im_context -->
Reset the input method context of the text view if needed.

This can be necessary in the case where modifying the buffer
would confuse on-going input method behavior.
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_mark_onscreen -->
Scrolls `self` the minimum distance such that `mark` is contained
within the visible area of the widget.
## `mark`
a mark in the buffer for `self`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_to_iter -->
Scrolls `self` so that `iter` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.

Note that this function uses the currently-computed height of the
lines in the text buffer. Line heights are computed in an idle
handler; so this function may not have the desired effect if it’s
called before the height computations. To avoid oddness, consider
using `TextViewExt::scroll_to_mark` which saves a point to be
scrolled to after line validation.
## `iter`
a `TextIter`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments (if `false`,

vertical alignment of mark within visible area

# Returns

`true` if scrolling occurred
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn scroll_to_mark -->
Scrolls `self` so that `mark` is on the screen in the position
indicated by `xalign` and `yalign`. An alignment of 0.0 indicates
left or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center.
If `use_align` is `false`, the text scrolls the minimal distance to
get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective
screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size
`within_margin`.
## `mark`
a `TextMark`
## `within_margin`
margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size

is `false` the keyboard focus is moved to the next widget in the focus
chain.
## `accepts_tab`
`true` if pressing the Tab key should insert a tab
 character, `false`, if pressing the Tab key should move the
 keyboard focus.

Note that this function is confusingly named.
In CSS terms, the value set here is padding.
## `bottom_margin`
bottom margin in pixels
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_buffer -->
Sets `buffer` as the buffer being displayed by `self`. The previous
buffer displayed by the text view is unreferenced, and a reference is
added to `buffer`. If you owned a reference to `buffer` before passing it
to this function, you must remove that reference yourself; `TextView`
will not “adopt” it.
## `buffer`
a `TextBuffer`
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_cursor_visible -->
Toggles whether the insertion point should be displayed. A buffer with
no editable text probably shouldn’t have a visible cursor, so you may
want to turn the cursor off.

Note that this property may be overridden by the
`Settings:gtk-keynav-use-caret` settings.
## `setting`
whether to show the insertion cursor
<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn set_editable -->
Sets the default editability of the `TextView`. You can override
this default setting with tags in the buffer, using the “editable”
attribute of tags.
## `setting`

<!-- trait TextViewExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The ::move-cursor signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user initiates a cursor movement.
If the cursor is not visible in `text_view`, this signal causes
the viewport to be moved instead.

<!-- struct ToggleButton -->
A `ToggleButton` is a `Button` which will remain “pressed-in” when
clicked. Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its
normal state.

A toggle button is created by calling either `ToggleButton::new` or
`ToggleButton::new_with_label`. If using the former, it is advisable to
pack a widget, (such as a `Label` and/or a `Image`), into the toggle
button’s container. (See `Button` for more information).

The state of a `ToggleButton` can be set specifically using
`ToggleButtonExt::set_active`, and retrieved using
`ToggleButtonExt::get_active`.

To simply switch the state of a toggle button, use `ToggleButtonExt::toggled`.

# CSS nodes

`ToggleButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
it from a plain `Button`, it gets the .toggle style class.

## Creating two `ToggleButton` widgets.


```C
static void output_state (GtkToggleButton *source, gpointer user_data) {
  printf ("Active: %d\n", gtk_toggle_button_get_active (source));
}

void make_toggles (void) {
  GtkWidget *window, *toggle1, *toggle2;
  GtkWidget *box;
  const char *text;

  window = gtk_window_new ();
  box = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 12);

  text = "Hi, I’m a toggle button.";
  toggle1 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);

  g_signal_connect (toggle1, "toggled",
                    G_CALLBACK (output_state),
                    NULL);
  gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (box), toggle1);

  text = "Hi, I’m a toggle button.";
  toggle2 = gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label (text);
  g_signal_connect (toggle2, "toggled",
                    G_CALLBACK (output_state),
                    NULL);
  gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (box), toggle2);

  gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), box);
  gtk_widget_show (window);
}

<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt -->
Trait containing all `ToggleButton` methods.

# Implementors

[`ToggleButton`](struct.ToggleButton.html)
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new -->
Creates a new toggle button. A widget should be packed into the button, as in `Button::new`.

# Returns

a new toggle button.
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new_with_label -->
Creates a new toggle button with a text label.
## `label`
a string containing the message to be placed in the toggle button.

# Returns

a new toggle button.
<!-- impl ToggleButton::fn new_with_mnemonic -->
Creates a new `ToggleButton` containing a label. The label
will be created using `Label::new_with_mnemonic`, so underscores
in `label` indicate the mnemonic for the button.
## `label`
the text of the button, with an underscore in front of the
 mnemonic character

# Returns

a new `ToggleButton`
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn get_active -->
Queries a `ToggleButton` and returns its current state. Returns `true` if
the toggle button is pressed in and `false` if it is raised.

# Returns

a `gboolean` value.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_active -->
Sets the status of the toggle button. Set to `true` if you want the
`ToggleButton` to be “pressed in”, and `false` to raise it.

If the status of the button changes, this action causes the
`ToggleButton::toggled` signal to be emitted.
## `is_active`
`true` or `false`.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn set_group -->
Adds `self_` to the group of `group`. In a group of multiple toggle buttons,
only one button can be active at a time.

Note that the same effect can be achieved via the `Actionable`
api, by using the same action with parameter type and state type 's'
for all buttons in the group, and giving each button its own target
value.
## `group`
another `ToggleButton` to
 form a group with
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn toggled -->
Emits the `ToggleButton::toggled` signal on the
`ToggleButton`. There is no good reason for an
application ever to call this function.
<!-- trait ToggleButtonExt::fn connect_toggled -->
Should be connected if you wish to perform an action whenever the
`ToggleButton`'s state is changed.
<!-- struct Tooltip -->
Basic tooltips can be realized simply by using `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_text`
or `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup` without any explicit tooltip object.

When you need a tooltip with a little more fancy contents, like adding an
image, or you want the tooltip to have different contents per `TreeView`
row or cell, you will have to do a little more work:

- Set the `Widget:has-tooltip` property to `true`, this will make GTK
 monitor the widget for motion and related events which are needed to
 determine when and where to show a tooltip.

- Connect to the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal. This signal will be
 emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown. One of the arguments passed
 to the signal handler is a `Tooltip` object. This is the object that we
 are about to display as a tooltip, and can be manipulated in your callback
 using functions like `Tooltip::set_icon`. There are functions for setting
 the tooltip’s markup, setting an image from a named icon, or even putting in
 a custom widget.

 Return `true` from your query-tooltip handler. This causes the tooltip to be
 show. If you return `false`, it will not be shown.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_custom -->
Replaces the widget packed into the tooltip with
`custom_widget`. `custom_widget` does not get destroyed when the tooltip goes
away.
By default a box with a `Image` and `Label` is embedded in
the tooltip, which can be configured using `Tooltip::set_markup`
and `Tooltip::set_icon`.
## `custom_widget`
a `Widget`, or `None` to unset the old custom widget.
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
`paintable`. If `paintable` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `paintable`
a `gdk::Paintable`, or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon_from_gicon -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text)
to be the icon indicated by `gicon` with the size indicated
by `size`. If `gicon` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `gicon`
a `gio::Icon` representing the icon, or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_icon_from_icon_name -->
Sets the icon of the tooltip (which is in front of the text) to be
the icon indicated by `icon_name` with the size indicated
by `size`. If `icon_name` is `None`, the image will be hidden.
## `icon_name`
an icon name, or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_markup -->
Sets the text of the tooltip to be `markup`, which is marked up
with the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].
If `markup` is `None`, the label will be hidden.
## `markup`
a markup string (see [Pango markup format][PangoMarkupFormat]) or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_text -->
Sets the text of the tooltip to be `text`. If `text` is `None`, the label
will be hidden. See also `Tooltip::set_markup`.
## `text`
a text string or `None`
<!-- impl Tooltip::fn set_tip_area -->
Sets the area of the widget, where the contents of this tooltip apply,
to be `rect` (in widget coordinates). This is especially useful for
properly setting tooltips on `TreeView` rows and cells, ``GtkIconViews``,
etc.

For setting tooltips on `TreeView`, please refer to the convenience
functions for this: `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_row` and
`TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_cell`.
## `rect`
a `gdk::Rectangle`
<!-- struct TreeDragDest -->


# Implements

[`TreeDragDestExt`](trait.TreeDragDestExt.html)
<!-- trait TreeDragDestExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeDragDest` methods.

# Implementors

[`ListStore`](struct.ListStore.html), [`TreeDragDest`](struct.TreeDragDest.html), [`TreeStore`](struct.TreeStore.html)
<!-- trait TreeDragDestExt::fn drag_data_received -->
Asks the `TreeDragDest` to insert a row before the path `dest`,
deriving the contents of the row from `value`. If `dest` is
outside the tree so that inserting before it is impossible, `false`
will be returned. Also, `false` may be returned if the new row is
not created for some model-specific reason. Should robustly handle
a `dest` no longer found in the model!
## `dest`
row to drop in front of
## `value`
data to drop

# Returns

whether a new row was created before position `dest`
<!-- trait TreeDragDestExt::fn row_drop_possible -->
Determines whether a drop is possible before the given `dest_path`,
at the same depth as `dest_path`. i.e., can we drop the data in
`value` at that location. `dest_path` does not have to
exist; the return value will almost certainly be `false` if the
parent of `dest_path` doesn’t exist, though.
## `dest_path`
destination row
## `value`
the data being dropped

# Returns

`true` if a drop is possible before `dest_path`
<!-- struct TreeDragSource -->


# Implements

[`TreeDragSourceExt`](trait.TreeDragSourceExt.html)
<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeDragSource` methods.

<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt::fn drag_data_delete -->
Asks the `TreeDragSource` to delete the row at `path`, because
it was moved somewhere else via drag-and-drop. Returns `false`
if the deletion fails because `path` no longer exists, or for
some model-specific reason. Should robustly handle a `path` no
longer found in the model!
## `path`
row that was being dragged

# Returns

`true` if the row was successfully deleted
<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt::fn drag_data_get -->
Asks the `TreeDragSource` to return a `gdk::ContentProvider` representing
the row at `path`. Should robustly handle a `path` no
longer found in the model!
## `path`
row that was dragged

# Returns

a `gdk::ContentProvider` for the
 given `path` or `None` if none exists
<!-- trait TreeDragSourceExt::fn row_draggable -->
Asks the `TreeDragSource` whether a particular row can be used as
the source of a DND operation. If the source doesn’t implement
this interface, the row is assumed draggable.
## `path`
row on which user is initiating a drag

# Returns

`true` if the row can be dragged
<!-- struct TreeExpander -->
`TreeExpander` is a widget that provides an expander for a list.

It is typically placed as a bottommost child into a `ListView` to allow
users to expand and collapse children in a list with a `TreeListModel`.
It will provide the common UI elements, gestures and keybindings for this
purpose.

On top of this, the "listitem.expand", "listitem.collapse" and
"listitem.toggle-expand" actions are provided to allow adding custom UI
for managing expanded state.

The `TreeListModel` must be set to not be passthrough. Then it will provide
`TreeListRow` items which can be set via `TreeExpander::set_list_row`
on the expander. The expander will then watch that row item automatically.
`TreeExpander::set_child` sets the widget that displays the actual row
contents.

# CSS nodes


```plain
treeexpander
├── [indent]*
├── [expander]
╰── <child>
```

`TreeExpander` has zero or one CSS nodes with the name "expander" that should
display the expander icon. The node will be `:checked` when it is expanded.
If the node is not expandable, an "indent" node will be displayed instead.

For every level of depth, another "indent" node is prepended.

# Accessibility

`TreeExpander` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role. The expander icon
is represented as a `AccessibleRole::Button`, labelled by the expander's
child, and toggling it will change the `AccessibleState::Expanded` state.

# Implements

[`WidgetExt`](trait.WidgetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`AccessibleExt`](trait.AccessibleExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`ConstraintTargetExt`](trait.ConstraintTargetExt.html), [`WidgetExtManual`](prelude/trait.WidgetExtManual.html)
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn new -->
Creates a new `TreeExpander`

# Returns

a new `TreeExpander`
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget displayed by `self`.

# Returns

The child displayed by `self`
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_item -->
Forwards the item set on the `TreeListRow` that `self` is managing.

This call is essentially equivalent to calling:


```C
  gtk_tree_list_row_get_item (gtk_tree_expander_get_list_row (@self));
```

# Returns

The item of the row
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_list_row -->
Gets the list row managed by `self`.

# Returns

The list row displayed by `self`
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn set_child -->
Sets the content widget to display.
## `child`
a `Widget`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn set_list_row -->
Sets the tree list row that this expander should manage.
## `list_row`
a `TreeListRow`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_property_child -->
The child widget with the actual contents
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn set_property_child -->
The child widget with the actual contents
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_property_item -->
The item held by this expander's row
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn get_property_list_row -->
The list row to track for expander state
<!-- impl TreeExpander::fn set_property_list_row -->
The list row to track for expander state
<!-- struct TreeIter -->
The `TreeIter` is the primary structure
for accessing a `TreeModel`. Models are expected to put a unique
integer in the `stamp` member, and put
model-specific data in the three `user_data`
members.
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn copy -->
Creates a dynamically allocated tree iterator as a copy of `self`.

This function is not intended for use in applications,
because you can just copy the structs by value
(`GtkTreeIter new_iter = iter;`).
You must free this iter with `TreeIter::free`.

# Returns

a newly-allocated copy of `self`
<!-- impl TreeIter::fn free -->
Frees an iterator that has been allocated by `TreeIter::copy`.

This function is mainly used for language bindings.
<!-- struct TreeListModel -->
`TreeListModel` is a `gio::ListModel` implementation that can expand rows
by creating new child list models on demand.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`gio::ListModelExt`](../gio/trait.ListModelExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn new -->
Creates a new empty `TreeListModel` displaying `root` with all rows collapsed.
## `root`
The `gio::ListModel` to use as root
## `passthrough`
`true` to pass through items from the models
## `autoexpand`
`true` to set the autoexpand property and expand the `root` model
## `create_func`
Function to call to create the `gio::ListModel` for the children
 of an item
## `user_data`
Data to pass to `create_func`
## `user_destroy`
Function to call to free `user_data`

# Returns

a newly created `TreeListModel`.
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_autoexpand -->
Gets whether the model is set to automatically expand new rows
that get added. This can be either rows added by changes to the
underlying models or via `TreeListRow::set_expanded`.

# Returns

`true` if the model is set to autoexpand
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_child_row -->
Gets the row item corresponding to the child at index `position` for
`self`'s root model.

If `position` is greater than the number of children in the root model,
`None` is returned.

Do not confuse this function with `TreeListModel::get_row`.
## `position`
position of the child to get

# Returns

the child in `position`
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_model -->
Gets the root model that `self` was created with.

# Returns

the root model
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_passthrough -->
If this function returns `false`, the `gio::ListModel` functions for `self`
return custom `TreeListRow` objects. You need to call
`TreeListRow::get_item` on these objects to get the original
item.

If `true`, the values of the child models are passed through in their
original state. You then need to call `TreeListModel::get_row`
to get the custom ``GtkTreeListRows``.

# Returns

`true` if the model is passing through original row items
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_row -->
Gets the row object for the given row. If `position` is greater than
the number of items in `self`, `None` is returned.

The row object can be used to expand and collapse rows as well as
to inspect its position in the tree. See its documentation for details.

This row object is persistent and will refer to the current item as
long as the row is present in `self`, independent of other rows being
added or removed.

If `self` is set to not be passthrough, this function is equivalent
to calling `gio::ListModel::get_item`.

Do not confuse this function with `TreeListModel::get_child_row`.
## `position`
the position of the row to fetch

# Returns

The row item
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn set_autoexpand -->
If set to `true`, the model will recursively expand all rows that
get added to the model. This can be either rows added by changes
to the underlying models or via `TreeListRow::set_expanded`.
## `autoexpand`
`true` to make the model autoexpand its rows
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_property_autoexpand -->
If all rows should be expanded by default
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn set_property_autoexpand -->
If all rows should be expanded by default
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_property_model -->
The root model displayed
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn get_property_passthrough -->
If `false`, the `gio::ListModel` functions for this object return custom
`TreeListRow` objects.
If `true`, the values of the child models are pass through unmodified.
<!-- impl TreeListModel::fn set_property_passthrough -->
If `false`, the `gio::ListModel` functions for this object return custom
`TreeListRow` objects.
If `true`, the values of the child models are pass through unmodified.
<!-- struct TreeListRow -->
`TreeListRow` is the object used by `TreeListModel` to
represent items. It allows navigating the model as a tree and
modify the state of rows.

`TreeListRow` instances are created by a `TreeListModel` only
when the `TreeListModel:passthrough` property is not set.

There are various support objects that can make use of `TreeListRow`
objects, such as the `TreeExpander` widget that allows displaying
an icon to expand or collapse a row or `TreeListRowSorter` that makes
it possible to sort trees properly.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_child_row -->
If `self` is not expanded or `position` is greater than the number of
children, `None` is returned.
## `position`
position of the child to get

# Returns

the child in `position`
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_children -->
If the row is expanded, gets the model holding the children of `self`.

This model is the model created by the ``GtkTreeListModelCreateModelFunc``
and contains the original items, no matter what value
`TreeListModel:passthrough` is set to.

# Returns

The model containing the children
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_depth -->
Gets the depth of this row. Rows that correspond to items in
the root model have a depth of zero, rows corresponding to items
of models of direct children of the root model have a depth of
1 and so on.

The depth of a row never changes until the row is destroyed.

# Returns

The depth of this row
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_expanded -->
Gets if a row is currently expanded.

# Returns

`true` if the row is expanded
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_item -->
Gets the item corresponding to this row,

The value returned by this function never changes until the
row is destroyed.

# Returns

The item of this row
 or `None` when the row was destroyed
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_parent -->
Gets the row representing the parent for `self`. That is the row that would
need to be collapsed to make this row disappear.

If `self` is a row corresponding to the root model, `None` is returned.

The value returned by this function never changes until the
row is destroyed.

# Returns

The parent of `self`
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_position -->
Returns the position in the `TreeListModel` that `self` occupies
at the moment.

# Returns

The position in the model
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn is_expandable -->
Checks if a row can be expanded. This does not mean that the
row is actually expanded, this can be checked with
`TreeListRow::get_expanded`

If a row is expandable never changes until the row is destroyed.

# Returns

`true` if the row is expandable
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn set_expanded -->
Expands or collapses a row.

If a row is expanded, the model of calling the
``GtkTreeListModelCreateModelFunc`` for the row's item will
be inserted after this row. If a row is collapsed, those
items will be removed from the model.

If the row is not expandable, this function does nothing.
## `expanded`
`true` if the row should be expanded
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_property_children -->
The model holding the row's children.
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_property_depth -->
The depth in the tree of this row
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_property_expandable -->
If this row can ever be expanded
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_property_expanded -->
If this row is currently expanded
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn set_property_expanded -->
If this row is currently expanded
<!-- impl TreeListRow::fn get_property_item -->
The item held in this row
<!-- struct TreeListRowSorter -->
`TreeListRowSorter` is a special-purpose sorter that will apply a given
sorter to the levels in a tree, while respecting the tree structure.

Here is an example for setting up a column view with a tree model and
a `GtkTreeListSorter`:


```text
column_sorter = gtk_column_view_get_sorter (view);

The `TreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
use by the `TreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
type for it to be viewable by a `TreeView` widget.

The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
every node has different values depending on which column is being
queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
model decides how and if changes are made.

In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
— the `TreeStore` and the `ListStore`. To use these, the
developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
these two models are sufficient.

Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
particular node in a model. They are the `TreePath`-struct and
the `TreeIter`-struct (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
interface consists of operations on a `TreeIter`-struct.

A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
model. The `TreePath`-struct can be converted into either an
array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
the third node.

By contrast, a `TreeIter`-struct is a reference to a specific node on
a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
`TreeModel::get_iter`. These iterators are the primary way
of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
`TextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
a set of operations using them for navigating the model.

It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
For example, the `ListStore` model, which is internally a simple
linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
`TreeModelSort` stores an array and an offset in two of the
pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.

The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
to is valid (most notably the `TreeStore` and `ListStore`).
Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
As a result, the `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` flag was added to
indicate this behavior.

To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
callbacks.

## Acquiring a `TreeIter`-struct


```C
// Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
GtkTreePath *path;
GtkTreeIter iter;
GtkTreeIter parent_iter;

// get the iterator from a string
gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                     &iter,
                                     "3:2:5");

// get the iterator from a path
path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
gtk_tree_path_free (path);

// walk the tree to find the iterator
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               NULL, 3);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 2);
parent_iter = iter;
gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                               &parent_iter, 5);
```

This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
`populate_model` function used below is not
shown, as it is specific to the `ListStore`. For information on
how to write such a function, see the `ListStore` documentation.

## Reading data from a `TreeModel`


```C
enum
{
  STRING_COLUMN,
  INT_COLUMN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

...

GtkTreeModel *list_store;
GtkTreeIter iter;
gboolean valid;
int row_count = 0;

// make a new list_store
list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                 G_TYPE_STRING,
                                 G_TYPE_INT);

// Fill the list store with data
populate_model (list_store);

// Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
// through the list, reading each row.

valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                       &iter);
while (valid)
 {
   char *str_data;
   int    int_data;

   // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
   gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                       STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                       INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                       -1);

   // Do something with the data
   g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
            row_count, str_data, int_data);
   g_free (str_data);

   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                     &iter);
   row_count++;
 }
```

The `TreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
counting: `TreeModel::ref_node` and `TreeModel::unref_node`.
These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
displayed. `TreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
folders that are currently expanded in every current view.

When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
into account:

- Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
 This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
 as well.

- Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
 possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
 row-deleted signal is received.

- Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
 siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
 required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
 however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
 is always referenced when any view is attached).

Creates a new `TreeModel`, with `self` as the child_model
and `root` as the virtual root.
## `root`
A `TreePath` or `None`.

# Returns

A new `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn foreach -->
Calls func on each node in model in a depth-first fashion.

If `func` returns `true`, then the tree ceases to be walked,
and `TreeModel::foreach` returns.
## `func`
a function to be called on each row
## `user_data`

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn get -->
Gets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by a place to store the value being
retrieved. The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to get a
value from column 0 with type `G_TYPE_STRING`, you would
write: `gtk_tree_model_get (model, iter, 0, &place_string_here, -1)`,
where `place_string_here` is a `gchararray`
to be filled with the string.

Returned values with type `G_TYPE_OBJECT` have to be unreferenced,
values with type `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED` have to be freed.
Other values are passed by value.

to free any allocated memory.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
## `column`
the column to lookup the value at
## `value`
an empty `gobject::Value` to set
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_children -->
Sets `iter` to point to the first child of `parent`.

If `parent` has no children, `false` is returned and `iter` is
set to be invalid. `parent` will remain a valid node after this
function has been called.

If `parent` is `None` returns the first node, equivalent to
`gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (tree_model, iter);`
## `iter`
the new `TreeIter`-struct to be set to the child
## `parent`
the `TreeIter`-struct, or `None`

`true` if `iter` has been changed to the next node
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_nth_child -->
Sets `iter` to be the child of `parent`, using the given index.

The first index is 0. If `n` is too big, or `parent` has no children,
`iter` is set to an invalid iterator and `false` is returned. `parent`
will remain a valid node after this function has been called. As a
special case, if `parent` is `None`, then the `n`-th root node
is set.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct to set to the nth child
## `parent`
the `TreeIter`-struct to get the child from, or `None`.
## `n`
the index of the desired child

# Returns

`true`, if `parent` has an `n`-th child
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn iter_parent -->
Sets `iter` to be the parent of `child`.

If `child` is at the toplevel, and doesn’t have a parent, then
`iter` is set to an invalid iterator and `false` is returned.
`child` will remain a valid node after this function has been
called.

`iter` will be initialized before the lookup is performed, so `child`
and `iter` cannot point to the same memory location.
## `iter`

## `child`
the `TreeIter`-struct

# Returns

`true`, if `iter` is set to the parent of `child`

<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn ref_node -->
Lets the tree ref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons.

This function is primarily meant as a way for views to let
caching models know when nodes are being displayed (and hence,
whether or not to cache that node). Being displayed means a node
is in an expanded branch, regardless of whether the node is currently
visible in the viewport. For example, a file-system based model
would not want to keep the entire file-hierarchy in memory,
just the sections that are currently being displayed by
every current view.

A model should be expected to be able to get an iter independent
of its reffed state.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_changed -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-changed` signal on `self`.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_deleted -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-deleted` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models after a row has been removed.
The location pointed to by `path` should be the location that
the row previously was at. It may not be a valid location anymore.

Nodes that are deleted are not unreffed, this means that any
outstanding references on the deleted node should not be released.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the previous location of
 the deleted row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_has_child_toggled -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-has-child-toggled` signal on
`self`. This should be called by models after the child
state of a node changes.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn row_inserted -->
Emits the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal on `self`.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the inserted row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the inserted row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn rows_reordered -->
Emits the `TreeModel::rows-reordered` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models when their rows have been
reordered.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node whose children
 have been reordered, or `None` if the depth of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the current position of
 each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn rows_reordered_with_length -->
Emits the `TreeModel::rows-reordered` signal on `self`.

This should be called by models when their rows have been
reordered.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct pointing to the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node
 whose children have been reordered, or `None` if the depth
 of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers
 mapping the current position of each child to its old
 position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`
## `length`
length of `new_order` array
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn unref_node -->
Lets the tree unref the node.

This is an optional method for models to implement.
To be more specific, models may ignore this call as it exists
primarily for performance reasons. For more information on what
this means, see `TreeModel::ref_node`.

Please note that nodes that are deleted are not unreffed.
## `iter`
the `TreeIter`-struct
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_changed -->
This signal is emitted when a row in the model has changed.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the changed row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the changed row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_deleted -->
This signal is emitted when a row has been deleted.

Note that no iterator is passed to the signal handler,
since the row is already deleted.

This should be called by models after a row has been removed.
The location pointed to by `path` should be the location that
the row previously was at. It may not be a valid location anymore.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_has_child_toggled -->
This signal is emitted when a row has gotten the first child
row or lost its last child row.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_row_inserted -->
This signal is emitted when a new row has been inserted in
the model.

Note that the row may still be empty at this point, since
it is a common pattern to first insert an empty row, and
then fill it with the desired values.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the new row
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the new row
<!-- trait TreeModelExt::fn connect_rows_reordered -->
This signal is emitted when the children of a node in the
`TreeModel` have been reordered.

Note that this signal is not emitted
when rows are reordered by DND, since this is implemented
by removing and then reinserting the row.
## `path`
a `TreePath`-struct identifying the tree node whose children
 have been reordered
## `iter`
a valid `TreeIter`-struct pointing to the node whose children
 have been reordered, or `None` if the depth of `path` is 0
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the current position
 of each child to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`
<!-- struct TreeModelFilter -->
A `TreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
and can do the following things:

- Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
 storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
 or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
 model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
 row should be filtered or not.

- Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
 This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
 values and also for creating a completely different model based
 on the given child model.

- Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
 in a `TreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
 time.

The basic API is similar to `TreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
see the section on `TreeModelSort`.

When using `TreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
`TreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
exposed by the child model. `TreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
because of reference counting rule 3, see the `TreeModel`
documentation. (Note that e.g. `TreeStore` does not implement
reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
the receiving node is not visible).

Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
nodes (see reference counting rule number 3 in the `TreeModel` section).

Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
`TreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.

This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
to accommodate this, `TreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `TreeModelFilter`'s
clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
was not cached), `TreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
of any parent node has changed.

Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
own. In this case, either rely on `TreeStore` to emit all signals
because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
yourself.

<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeModelFilter` methods.

# Implementors

[`TreeModelFilter`](struct.TreeModelFilter.html)
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn clear_cache -->
This function should almost never be called. It clears the `self`
of any cached iterators that haven’t been reffed with
`TreeModel::ref_node`. This might be useful if the child model
being filtered is static (and doesn’t change often) and there has been
a lot of unreffed access to nodes. As a side effect of this function,
all unreffed iters will be invalid.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_child_iter_to_iter -->
Sets `filter_iter` to point to the row in `self` that corresponds to the
row pointed at by `child_iter`. If `filter_iter` was not set, `false` is
returned.
## `filter_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `child_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on the child model.

# Returns

`true`, if `filter_iter` was set, i.e. if `child_iter` is a
valid iterator pointing to a visible row in child model.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_child_path_to_path -->
Converts `child_path` to a path relative to `self`. That is, `child_path`
points to a path in the child model. The rerturned path will point to the
same row in the filtered model. If `child_path` isn’t a valid path on the
child model or points to a row which is not visible in `self`, then `None`
is returned.
## `child_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_iter_to_child_iter -->
Sets `child_iter` to point to the row pointed to by `filter_iter`.
## `child_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `filter_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on `self`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn convert_path_to_child_path -->
Converts `filter_path` to a path on the child model of `self`. That is,
`filter_path` points to a location in `self`. The returned path will
point to the same location in the model not being filtered. If `filter_path`
does not point to a location in the child model, `None` is returned.
## `filter_path`
A `TreePath` to convert.

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn get_model -->
Returns a pointer to the child model of `self`.

# Returns

A pointer to a `TreeModel`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn refilter -->
Emits ::row_changed for each row in the child model, which causes
the filter to re-evaluate whether a row is visible or not.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_modify_func -->
With the `n_columns` and `types` parameters, you give an array of column
types for this model (which will be exposed to the parent model/view).
The `func`, `data` and `destroy` parameters are for specifying the modify
function. The modify function will get called for each
data access, the goal of the modify function is to return the data which
should be displayed at the location specified using the parameters of the
modify function.

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_modify_func`
can only be called once for a given filter model.
## `n_columns`
The number of columns in the filter model.
## `types`
The `GTypes` of the columns.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterModifyFunc``
## `data`
User data to pass to the modify function, or `None`.
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_visible_column -->
Sets `column` of the child_model to be the column where `self` should
look for visibility information. `columns` should be a column of type
`G_TYPE_BOOLEAN`, where `true` means that a row is visible, and `false`
if not.

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `column`
A `int` which is the column containing the visible information
<!-- trait TreeModelFilterExt::fn set_visible_func -->
Sets the visible function used when filtering the `self` to be `func`.
The function should return `true` if the given row should be visible and
`false` otherwise.

If the condition calculated by the function changes over time (e.g.
because it depends on some global parameters), you must call
`TreeModelFilterExt::refilter` to keep the visibility information
of the model up-to-date.

Note that `func` is called whenever a row is inserted, when it may still
be empty. The visible function should therefore take special care of empty
rows, like in the example below.


```C
static gboolean
visible_func (GtkTreeModel *model,
              GtkTreeIter  *iter,
              gpointer      data)
{
  // Visible if row is non-empty and first column is “HI”
  char *str;
  gboolean visible = FALSE;

  gtk_tree_model_get (model, iter, 0, &str, -1);
  if (str && strcmp (str, "HI") == 0)
    visible = TRUE;
  g_free (str);

  return visible;
}
```

Note that `TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_func` or
`TreeModelFilterExt::set_visible_column` can only be called
once for a given filter model.
## `func`
A ``GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc``, the visible function
## `data`
User data to pass to the visible function, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `data`, or `None`
<!-- struct TreeModelFlags -->
These flags indicate various properties of a `TreeModel`.

They are returned by `TreeModel::get_flags`, and must be
static for the lifetime of the object. A more complete description
of `TreeModelFlags::ItersPersist` can be found in the overview of
this section.
<!-- struct TreeModelFlags::const ITERS_PERSIST -->
iterators survive all signals
 emitted by the tree
<!-- struct TreeModelFlags::const LIST_ONLY -->
the model is a list only, and never
 has children
<!-- struct TreeModelSort -->
The `TreeModelSort` is a model which implements the `TreeSortable`
interface. It does not hold any data itself, but rather is created with
a child model and proxies its data. It has identical column types to
this child model, and the changes in the child are propagated. The
primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different
model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by
`TreeModelSort` is not guaranteed to be stable.

The use of this is best demonstrated through an example. In the
following sample code we create two `TreeView` widgets each with a
view of the same data. As the model is wrapped here by a
`TreeModelSort`, the two ``GtkTreeViews`` can each sort their
view of the data without affecting the other. By contrast, if we
simply put the same model in each widget, then sorting the first would
sort the second.

## Using a `TreeModelSort`


```C
{
  GtkTreeView *tree_view1;
  GtkTreeView *tree_view2;
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model1;
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model2;
  GtkTreeModel *child_model;

  // get the child model
  child_model = get_my_model ();

  // Create the first tree
  sort_model1 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
  tree_view1 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model1);

  // Create the second tree
  sort_model2 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
  tree_view2 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model2);

  // Now we can sort the two models independently
  gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model1),
                                        COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_ASCENDING);
  gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model2),
                                        COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_DESCENDING);
}
```

To demonstrate how to access the underlying child model from the sort
model, the next example will be a callback for the `TreeSelection`
`TreeSelection::changed` signal. In this callback, we get a string
from COLUMN_1 of the model. We then modify the string, find the same
selected row on the child model, and change the row there.

## Accessing the child model of in a selection changed callback


```C
void
selection_changed (GtkTreeSelection *selection, gpointer data)
{
  GtkTreeModel *sort_model = NULL;
  GtkTreeModel *child_model;
  GtkTreeIter sort_iter;
  GtkTreeIter child_iter;
  char *some_data = NULL;
  char *modified_data;

  // Get the current selected row and the model.
  if (! gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (selection,
                                         &sort_model,
                                         &sort_iter))
    return;

  // Look up the current value on the selected row and get
  // a new value to change it to.
  gtk_tree_model_get (GTK_TREE_MODEL (sort_model), &sort_iter,
                      COLUMN_1, &some_data,
                      -1);

  modified_data = change_the_data (some_data);
  g_free (some_data);

  // Get an iterator on the child model, instead of the sort model.
  gtk_tree_model_sort_convert_iter_to_child_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL_SORT (sort_model),
                                                  &child_iter,
                                                  &sort_iter);

  // Get the child model and change the value of the row. In this
  // example, the child model is a GtkListStore. It could be any other
  // type of model, though.
  child_model = gtk_tree_model_sort_get_model (GTK_TREE_MODEL_SORT (sort_model));
  gtk_list_store_set (GTK_LIST_STORE (child_model), &child_iter,
                      COLUMN_1, &modified_data,
                      -1);
  g_free (modified_data);
}

Creates a new `TreeModelSort`, with `child_model` as the child model.
## `child_model`
A `TreeModel`

# Returns

A new `TreeModelSort`.
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn clear_cache -->
This function should almost never be called. It clears the `self`
of any cached iterators that haven’t been reffed with
`TreeModel::ref_node`. This might be useful if the child model being
sorted is static (and doesn’t change often) and there has been a lot of
unreffed access to nodes. As a side effect of this function, all unreffed
iters will be invalid.
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn convert_child_iter_to_iter -->
Sets `sort_iter` to point to the row in `self` that corresponds to
the row pointed at by `child_iter`. If `sort_iter` was not set, `false`
is returned. Note: a boolean is only returned since 2.14.
## `sort_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`.
## `child_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on the child model

`true`, if `sort_iter` was set, i.e. if `sort_iter` is a
valid iterator pointer to a visible row in the child model.
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn convert_child_path_to_path -->
Converts `child_path` to a path relative to `self`. That is,
`child_path` points to a path in the child model. The returned path will
point to the same row in the sorted model. If `child_path` isn’t a valid
path on the child model, then `None` is returned.
## `child_path`
A `TreePath` to convert

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn convert_iter_to_child_iter -->
Sets `child_iter` to point to the row pointed to by `sorted_iter`.
## `child_iter`
An uninitialized `TreeIter`
## `sorted_iter`
A valid `TreeIter` pointing to a row on `self`.
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn convert_path_to_child_path -->
Converts `sorted_path` to a path on the child model of `self`.
That is, `sorted_path` points to a location in `self`. The
returned path will point to the same location in the model not being
sorted. If `sorted_path` does not point to a location in the child model,
`None` is returned.
## `sorted_path`
A `TreePath` to convert

# Returns

A newly allocated `TreePath`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn get_model -->

## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- trait TreeModelSortExt::fn reset_default_sort_func -->
This resets the default sort function to be in the “unsorted” state. That
is, it is in the same order as the child model. It will re-sort the model
to be in the same order as the child model only if the `TreeModelSort`
is in “unsorted” state.
<!-- struct TreePath -->
<!-- impl TreePath::fn new -->
Creates a new `TreePath`-struct.

child of that 11th child, and the 1st child of that 5th child.
If an invalid path string is passed in, `None` is returned.
## `path`
The string representation of a path

# Returns

A newly-created `TreePath`-struct, or `None`
<!-- impl TreePath::fn append_index -->
Appends a new index to a path.

As a result, the depth of the path is increased.
## `index_`

# Returns

a new `TreePath`-struct
<!-- impl TreePath::fn down -->

The current
 indices, or `None`
<!-- impl TreePath::fn is_ancestor -->

current depth, if it exists.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has a previous node, and
 the move was made
<!-- impl TreePath::fn to_string -->
Generates a string representation of the path.

This string is a “:” separated list of numbers.
For example, “4:10:0:3” would be an acceptable
return value for this string. If the path has
depth 0, `None` is returned.

# Returns

A newly-allocated string.
 Must be freed with `g_free`.
<!-- impl TreePath::fn up -->
Moves the `self` to point to its parent node, if it has a parent.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has a parent, and the move was made
<!-- struct TreeRowReference -->
A `TreeRowReference` tracks model changes so that it always refers to the
same row (a `TreePath` refers to a position, not a fixed row). Create a
new `TreeRowReference` with `TreeRowReference::new`.
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn new -->
Creates a row reference based on `path`.

This reference will keep pointing to the node pointed to
by `path`, so long as it exists. Any changes that occur on `model` are
propagated, and the path is updated appropriately. If
`path` isn’t a valid path in `model`, then `None` is returned.
## `model`
a `TreeModel`
## `path`
a valid `TreePath`-struct to monitor

# Returns

a newly allocated `TreeRowReference`, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn new_proxy -->
You do not need to use this function.

Creates a row reference based on `path`.

This reference will keep pointing to the node pointed to
by `path`, so long as it exists. If `path` isn’t a valid
path in `model`, then `None` is returned. However, unlike
references created with `TreeRowReference::new`, it
does not listen to the model for changes. The creator of
the row reference must do this explicitly using
`TreeRowReference::inserted`, `TreeRowReference::deleted`,
`TreeRowReference::reordered`.

These functions must be called exactly once per proxy when the
corresponding signal on the model is emitted. This single call
updates all row references for that proxy. Since built-in GTK
objects like `TreeView` already use this mechanism internally,
using them as the proxy object will produce unpredictable results.
Further more, passing the same object as `model` and `proxy`
doesn’t work for reasons of internal implementation.

This type of row reference is primarily meant by structures that
need to carefully monitor exactly when a row reference updates
itself, and is not generally needed by most applications.
## `proxy`
a proxy `gobject::Object`
## `model`
a `TreeModel`
## `path`
a valid `TreePath`-struct to monitor

# Returns

a newly allocated `TreeRowReference`, or `None`

<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn free -->
Free’s `self`. `self` may be `None`
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn get_model -->
Returns the model that the row reference is monitoring.

# Returns

the model
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn get_path -->
Returns a path that the row reference currently points to,
or `None` if the path pointed to is no longer valid.

# Returns

a current path, or `None`
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn valid -->
Returns `true` if the `self` is non-`None` and refers to
a current valid path.

# Returns

`true` if `self` points to a valid path
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn deleted -->
Lets a set of row reference created by
`TreeRowReference::new_proxy` know that the
model emitted the `TreeModel::row-deleted` signal.
## `proxy`
a `gobject::Object`
## `path`
the path position that was deleted

`TreeRowReference::new_proxy` know that the
model emitted the `TreeModel::row-inserted` signal.
## `proxy`
a `gobject::Object`
## `path`
the row position that was inserted
<!-- impl TreeRowReference::fn reordered -->
Lets a set of row reference created by
`TreeRowReference::new_proxy` know that the
model emitted the `TreeModel::rows-reordered` signal.
## `proxy`
a `gobject::Object`
## `path`
the parent path of the reordered signal
## `iter`
the iter pointing to the parent of the reordered
## `new_order`
the new order of rows
<!-- struct TreeSelection -->
The `TreeSelection` object is a helper object to manage the selection
for a `TreeView` widget. The `TreeSelection` object is
automatically created when a new `TreeView` widget is created, and
cannot exist independently of this widget. The primary reason the
`TreeSelection` objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
methods on the `TreeView` widget instead of a separate function.

The `TreeSelection` object is gotten from a `TreeView` by calling
`TreeViewExt::get_selection`. It can be manipulated to check the
selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result, multiple
views of the same model can have completely different selections.
Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
first.

One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
a view is that the `TreeSelection::changed` signal is mostly a hint.
That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
Additionally, it may on occasion emit a `TreeSelection::changed` signal
when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
select_row on an already selected row).

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn count_selected_rows -->

`SelectionMode::Single` or `SelectionMode::Browse`. `iter` may be NULL if you
just want to test if `self` has any selected nodes. `model` is filled
with the current model as a convenience. This function will not work if you
use `self` is `SelectionMode::Multiple`.
## `model`
A pointer to set to the `TreeModel`, or NULL.
## `iter`
The `TreeIter`, or NULL.

# Returns

TRUE, if there is a selected node.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn get_selected_rows -->
Creates a list of path of all selected rows. Additionally, if you are
planning on modifying the model after calling this function, you may
want to convert the returned list into a list of ``GtkTreeRowReferences``.
To do this, you can use `TreeRowReference::new`.

To free the return value, use:

```C
g_list_free_full (list, (GDestroyNotify) gtk_tree_path_free);

## `start_path`
The initial node of the range.
## `end_path`
The final node of the range.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn selected_foreach -->
Calls a function for each selected node. Note that you cannot modify
the tree or selection from within this function. As a result,
`TreeSelection::get_selected_rows` might be more useful.
## `func`
The function to call for each selected node.
## `data`
user data to pass to the function.

<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn set_select_function -->
Sets the selection function.

If set, this function is called before any node is selected or unselected,
giving some control over which nodes are selected. The select function
should return `true` if the state of the node may be toggled, and `false`
if the state of the node should be left unchanged.
## `func`

<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn connect_changed -->
Emitted whenever the selection has (possibly) changed. Please note that
this signal is mostly a hint. It may only be emitted once when a range
of rows are selected, and it may occasionally be emitted when nothing
has happened.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn get_property_mode -->

See `TreeSelection::set_mode` for more information on this property.
<!-- impl TreeSelection::fn set_property_mode -->

primarily by `GtkTreeViewColumns` in order to determine if a model can
go back to the default state, or not.

# Returns

`true`, if the model has a default sort function
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_default_sort_func -->
Sets the default comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`.
If the current sort column id of `self` is
`GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, then the model will sort using
this function.

If `sort_func` is `None`, then there will be no default comparison function.
This means that once the model has been sorted, it can’t go back to the
default state. In this case, when the current sort column id of `self`
is `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`, the model will be unsorted.
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the current sort column to be `sort_column_id`. The `self` will
resort itself to reflect this change, after emitting a
`TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal. `sort_column_id` may either be
a regular column id, or one of the following special values:

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_DEFAULT_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: the default sort function
 will be used, if it is set

- `GTK_TREE_SORTABLE_UNSORTED_SORT_COLUMN_ID`: no sorting will occur
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set
## `order`
The sort order of the column
<!-- trait TreeSortableExtManual::fn set_sort_func -->
Sets the comparison function used when sorting to be `sort_func`. If the
current sort column id of `self` is the same as `sort_column_id`, then
the model will sort using this function.
## `sort_column_id`
the sort column id to set the function for
## `sort_func`
The comparison function
## `user_data`
User data to pass to `sort_func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier of `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn sort_column_changed -->
Emits a `TreeSortable::sort-column-changed` signal on `self`.
<!-- trait TreeSortableExt::fn connect_sort_column_changed -->
The ::sort-column-changed signal is emitted when the sort column
or sort order of `sortable` is changed. The signal is emitted before
the contents of `sortable` are resorted.
<!-- struct TreeStore -->
The `TreeStore` object is a list model for use with a `TreeView`
widget. It implements the `TreeModel` interface, and consequently,
can use all of the methods available there. It also implements the
`TreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view. Finally,
it also implements the tree
[drag and drop][gtk3-`TreeView`-drag-and-drop]
interfaces.

# `TreeStore` as `Buildable`

The `TreeStore` implementation of the `Buildable` interface allows
to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
attribute specifies the data type for the column.

An example of a UI Definition fragment for a tree store:

```text
<object class="GtkTreeStore">
  <columns>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gchararray"/>
    <column type="gint"/>
  </columns>
</object>
```

<!-- trait TreeStoreExt -->
Trait containing all `TreeStore` methods.

# Implementors

[`TreeStore`](struct.TreeStore.html)
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn new -->
Creates a new tree store as with `n_columns` columns each of the types passed
in. Note that only types derived from standard GObject fundamental types
are supported.

As an example, `gtk_tree_store_new (3, G_TYPE_INT, G_TYPE_STRING,
GDK_TYPE_TEXTURE);` will create a new `TreeStore` with three columns, of type
`int`, `gchararray`, and `gdk::Texture` respectively.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- impl TreeStore::fn newv -->
Non vararg creation function. Used primarily by language bindings.
## `n_columns`
number of columns in the tree store
## `types`
an array of `glib::Type` types for the columns, from first to last

# Returns

a new `TreeStore`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn append -->
Appends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will append the
new row after the last child of `parent`, otherwise it will append a row to
the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the appended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn clear -->
Removes all rows from `self`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert -->
Creates a new row at `position`. If parent is non-`None`, then the row will be
made a child of `parent`. Otherwise, the row will be created at the toplevel.
If `position` is -1 or is larger than the number of rows at that level, then
the new row will be inserted to the end of the list. `iter` will be changed
to point to this new row. The row will be empty after this function is
called. To fill in values, you need to call `TreeStoreExt::set` or
`TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts a new row after `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will be
prepended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be prepended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts a new row before `sibling`. If `sibling` is `None`, then the row will
be appended to `parent` ’s children. If `parent` and `sibling` are `None`, then
the row will be appended to the toplevel. If both `sibling` and `parent` are
set, then `parent` must be the parent of `sibling`. When `sibling` is set,
`parent` is optional.

`iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after
this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
`TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the new row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `sibling`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_with_values -->
Creates a new row at `position`. `iter` will be changed to point to this
new row. If `position` is -1, or larger than the number of rows on the list, then
the new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with
the values given to this function.

Calling
`gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values (tree_store, iter, position, ...)`
has the same effect as calling

```C
gtk_tree_store_insert (tree_store, iter, position);
gtk_tree_store_set (tree_store, iter, ...);
```
with the different that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,
while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and if the tree store
is sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signal
repeatedly can affect the performance of the program,
`TreeStoreExt::insert_with_values` should generally be preferred when
inserting rows in a sorted tree store.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existing rows
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn insert_with_valuesv -->
A variant of `TreeStoreExt::insert_with_values` which takes
the columns and values as two arrays, instead of varargs. This
function is mainly intended for language bindings.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set the new row, or `None`.
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `position`
position to insert the new row, or -1 for last

an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`
the length of the `columns` and `values` arrays
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn is_ancestor -->
Returns `true` if `iter` is an ancestor of `descendant`. That is, `iter` is the
parent (or grandparent or great-grandparent) of `descendant`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`
## `descendant`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true`, if `iter` is an ancestor of `descendant`

Returns the depth of `iter`. This will be 0 for anything on the root level, 1
for anything down a level, etc.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

The depth of `iter`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn iter_is_valid -->
WARNING: This function is slow. Only use it for debugging and/or testing
purposes.

Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `TreeStore`.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.

# Returns

`true` if the iter is valid, `false` if the iter is invalid.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn move_after -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position after `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be moved
to the start of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn move_before -->
Moves `iter` in `self` to the position before `position`. `iter` and
`position` should be in the same level. Note that this function only
works with unsorted stores. If `position` is `None`, `iter` will be
moved to the end of the level.
## `iter`
A `TreeIter`.
## `position`
A `TreeIter` or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn prepend -->
Prepends a new row to `self`. If `parent` is non-`None`, then it will prepend
the new row before the first child of `parent`, otherwise it will prepend a row
to the top level. `iter` will be changed to point to this new row. The row
will be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to
call `TreeStoreExt::set` or `TreeStore::set_value`.
## `iter`
An unset `TreeIter` to set to the prepended row
## `parent`
A valid `TreeIter`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn remove -->
Removes `iter` from `self`. After being removed, `iter` is set to the
next valid row at that level, or invalidated if it previously pointed to the
last one.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter`

# Returns

`true` if `iter` is still valid, `false` if not.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn reorder -->
Reorders the children of `parent` in `self` to follow the order
indicated by `new_order`. Note that this function only works with
unsorted stores.
## `parent`
A `TreeIter`, or `None`
## `new_order`
an array of integers mapping the new position of each child
 to its old position before the re-ordering,
 i.e. `new_order``[newpos] = oldpos`.
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set -->
Sets the value of one or more cells in the row referenced by `iter`.
The variable argument list should contain integer column numbers,
each column number followed by the value to be set.
The list is terminated by a -1. For example, to set column 0 with type
`G_TYPE_STRING` to “Foo”, you would write
`gtk_tree_store_set (store, iter, 0, "Foo", -1)`.

The value will be referenced by the store if it is a `G_TYPE_OBJECT`, and it
will be copied if it is a `G_TYPE_STRING` or `G_TYPE_BOXED`.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set_column_types -->
This function is meant primarily for `GObjects` that inherit from
`TreeStore`, and should only be used when constructing a new
`TreeStore`. It will not function after a row has been added,
or a method on the `TreeModel` interface is called.
## `n_columns`
Number of columns for the tree store
## `types`
An array of `glib::Type` types, one for each column
<!-- trait TreeStoreExt::fn set_valist -->
See `TreeStoreExt::set`; this version takes a va_list for
use by language bindings.

function is mainly intended for language bindings or in case
the number of columns to change is not known until run-time.
## `iter`
A valid `TreeIter` for the row being modified
## `columns`
an array of column numbers
## `values`
an array of GValues
## `n_values`

## `b`
Another `TreeIter`.
<!-- struct TreeView -->
Widget that displays any object that implements the `TreeModel` interface.

Please refer to the
[tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related
to the tree widget and how they work together.

Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the `TreeView` API.
These are:

![](tree-view-coordinates.png)

Coordinate systems in `TreeView` API:

- Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).

- Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that `TreeView` renders to.

- Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of `TreeView`. These
 coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.

Several functions are available for converting between the different
coordinate systems. The most common translations are between widget and bin
window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
former you can use `TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`
(and vice versa), for the latter `TreeViewExt::convert_bin_window_to_tree_coords`
(and vice versa).

# `TreeView` as `Buildable`

The `TreeView` implementation of the `Buildable` interface accepts
`TreeViewColumn` objects as `<child>` elements and exposes the internal
`TreeSelection` in UI definitions.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `TreeView`:

```plain
treeview.view
├── header
│   ├── <column header>
┊   ┊
│   ╰── <column header>
│
├── [rubberband]
╰── [dndtarget]
```

`TreeView` has a main CSS node with name treeview and style class .view.
It has a subnode with name header, which is the parent for all the column
header widgets' CSS nodes.

For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

For the drop target location during DND, a subnode with name dndtarget is used.

Fills the bounding rectangle in bin_window coordinates for the cell at the
row specified by `path` and the column specified by `column`. If `path` is
`None`, or points to a node not found in the tree, the `y` and `height` fields of
the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The returned rectangle is equivalent to the
`background_area` passed to `gtk_cell_renderer_render`. These background

Fills the bounding rectangle in bin_window coordinates for the cell at the
row specified by `path` and the column specified by `column`. If `path` is
`None`, or points to a path not currently displayed, the `y` and `height` fields
of the rectangle will be filled with 0. If `column` is `None`, the `x` and `width`
fields will be filled with 0. The sum of all cell rects does not cover the
entire tree; there are extra pixels in between rows, for example. The
returned rectangle is equivalent to the `cell_area` passed to
`gtk_cell_renderer_render`. This function is only valid if `self` is
realized.

 filled with the current cursor path, or `None`
## `focus_column`
A
 pointer to be filled with the current focus column, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_dest_row_at_pos -->
Determines the destination row for a given position. `drag_x` and
`drag_y` are expected to be in widget coordinates. This function is only
meaningful if `self` is realized. Therefore this function will always
return `false` if `self` is not realized or does not have a model.
## `drag_x`
the position to determine the destination row for
## `drag_y`
the position to determine the destination row for
## `path`
Return location for the path of
 the highlighted row, or `None`.
## `pos`

# Returns

The number of columns in the `self`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_path_at_pos -->
Finds the path at the point (`x`, `y`), relative to bin_window coordinates.
That is, `x` and `y` are relative to an events coordinates. Widget-relative
coordinates must be converted using
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`. It is primarily for
things like popup menus. If `path` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the `TreePath` at that point. This path should be freed with
`TreePath::free`. If `column` is non-`None`, then it will be filled
with the column at that point. `cell_x` and `cell_y` return the coordinates
relative to the cell background (i.e. the `background_area` passed to
`gtk_cell_renderer_render`). This function is only meaningful if
`self` is realized. Therefore this function will always return `false`
if `self` is not realized or does not have a model.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

the index of the tooltip column that is currently being
used, or -1 if this is disabled.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_tooltip_context -->
This function is supposed to be used in a `Widget::query-tooltip`
signal handler for `TreeView`. The `x`, `y` and `keyboard_tip` values
which are received in the signal handler, should be passed to this
function without modification.

The return value indicates whether there is a tree view row at the given
coordinates (`true`) or not (`false`) for mouse tooltips. For keyboard
tooltips the row returned will be the cursor row. When `true`, then any of
`model`, `path` and `iter` which have been provided will be set to point to
that row and the corresponding model. `x` and `y` will always be converted
to be relative to `self`’s bin_window if `keyboard_tooltip` is `false`.

scrollable area of the tree.
## `visible_rect`
rectangle to fill
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn insert_column -->
This inserts the `column` into the `self` at `position`. If `position` is
-1, then the column is inserted at the end. If `self` has

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn is_blank_at_pos -->
Determine whether the point (`x`, `y`) in `self` is blank, that is no
cell content nor an expander arrow is drawn at the location. If so, the
location can be considered as the background. You might wish to take
special action on clicks on the background, such as clearing a current
selection, having a custom context menu or starting rubber banding.

The `x` and `y` coordinate that are provided must be relative to bin_window
coordinates. Widget-relative coordinates must be converted using
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get from
`Widget`::query-tooltip), please see
`TreeViewExt::convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords`.

The `path`, `column`, `cell_x` and `cell_y` arguments will be filled in
likewise as for `TreeViewExt::get_path_at_pos`. Please see
`TreeViewExt::get_path_at_pos` for more information.
## `x`

 cell can be placed, or `None`

# Returns

`true` if the area at the given coordinates is blank,
`false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn is_rubber_banding_active -->
Returns whether a rubber banding operation is currently being done
in `self`.

# Returns

`true` if a rubber banding operation is currently being
done in `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn map_expanded_rows -->
Calls `func` on all expanded rows.
## `func`
A function to be called
## `data`
User data to be passed to the function.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn move_column_after -->
Moves `column` to be after to `base_column`. If `base_column` is `None`, then
`column` is placed in the first position.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to be moved.
## `base_column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to be moved relative to, or `None`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn remove_column -->
Removes `column` from `self`.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to remove.

# Returns

The number of columns in `self` after removing.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn row_activated -->
Activates the cell determined by `path` and `column`.
## `path`
The `TreePath` to be activated.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to be activated.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn row_expanded -->
Returns `true` if the node pointed to by `path` is expanded in `self`.
## `path`
A `TreePath` to test expansion state.

# Returns

`true` if `path` is expanded.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn scroll_to_cell -->
Moves the alignments of `self` to the position specified by `column` and
`path`. If `column` is `None`, then no horizontal scrolling occurs. Likewise,
if `path` is `None` no vertical scrolling occurs. At a minimum, one of `column`
or `path` need to be non-`None`. `row_align` determines where the row is
placed, and `col_align` determines where `column` is placed. Both are expected
to be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means
right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the cell onto the screen.
This means that the cell will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position. If the cell is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on the
model. If the model changes before the `self` is realized, the centered
path will be modified to reflect this change.
## `path`
The path of the row to move to, or `None`.
## `column`
The `TreeViewColumn` to move horizontally to, or `None`.
## `use_align`
whether to use alignment arguments, or `false`.
## `row_align`
The vertical alignment of the row specified by `path`.
## `col_align`
The horizontal alignment of the column specified by `column`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn scroll_to_point -->
Scrolls the tree view such that the top-left corner of the visible
area is `tree_x`, `tree_y`, where `tree_x` and `tree_y` are specified
in tree coordinates. The `self` must be realized before
this function is called. If it isn't, you probably want to be
using `TreeViewExt::scroll_to_cell`.

If either `tree_x` or `tree_y` are -1, then that direction isn’t scrolled.
## `tree_x`
X coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
## `tree_y`
Y coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_activate_on_single_click -->
Cause the `TreeView::row-activated` signal to be emitted
on a single click instead of a double click.
## `single`
`true` to emit row-activated on a single click
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_column_drag_function -->
Sets a user function for determining where a column may be dropped when
dragged. This function is called on every column pair in turn at the
beginning of a column drag to determine where a drop can take place. The
arguments passed to `func` are: the `self`, the `TreeViewColumn` being
dragged, the two `TreeViewColumn` s determining the drop spot, and
`user_data`. If either of the `TreeViewColumn` arguments for the drop spot
are `None`, then they indicate an edge. If `func` is set to be `None`, then
`self` reverts to the default behavior of allowing all columns to be
dropped everywhere.
## `func`
A function to determine which columns are reorderable, or `None`.
## `user_data`
User data to be passed to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
Destroy notifier for `user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. Additionally, if `focus_column` is specified, and `start_editing` is
`true`, then editing should be started in the specified cell.
This function is often followed by `WidgetExt::grab_focus` (`self`)
in order to give keyboard focus to the widget. Please note that editing
can only happen when the widget is realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `focus_column`
A `TreeViewColumn`, or `None`
## `start_editing`
`true` if the specified cell should start being edited.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_cursor_on_cell -->
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it. This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular row. If
`focus_column` is not `None`, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. If `focus_column` and `focus_cell` are not `None`, and `focus_column`
contains 2 or more editable or activatable cells, then focus is given to
the cell specified by `focus_cell`. Additionally, if `focus_column` is
specified, and `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be started in
the specified cell. This function is often followed by
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` (`self`) in order to give keyboard focus to the
widget. Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is
realized.

If `path` is invalid for `model`, the current cursor (if any) will be unset
and the function will return without failing.
## `path`
A `TreePath`
## `focus_column`
A `TreeViewColumn`, or `None`
## `focus_cell`
A `CellRenderer`, or `None`

## `path`
The path of the row to highlight, or `None`
## `pos`
Specifies whether to drop before, after or into the row
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_enable_search -->
If `enable_search` is set, then the user can type in text to search through
the tree interactively (this is sometimes called "typeahead find").

Note that even if this is `false`, the user can still initiate a search
using the “start-interactive-search” key binding.
## `enable_search`
`true`, if the user can search interactively
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_enable_tree_lines -->
Sets whether to draw lines interconnecting the expanders in `self`.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `enabled`
`true` to enable tree line drawing, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_expander_column -->
Sets the column to draw the expander arrow at. It must be in `self`.
If `column` is `None`, then the expander arrow is always at the first
visible column.

If you do not want expander arrow to appear in your tree, set the
expander column to a hidden column.
## `column`
`None`, or the column to draw the expander arrow at.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_fixed_height_mode -->
Enables or disables the fixed height mode of `self`.
Fixed height mode speeds up `TreeView` by assuming that all
rows have the same height.
Only enable this option if all rows are the same height and all
columns are of type `TreeViewColumnSizing::Fixed`.
## `enable`
`true` to enable fixed height mode
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_grid_lines -->
Sets which grid lines to draw in `self`.
## `grid_lines`

moves over them.
## `expand`
`true` to enable hover selection mode
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_hover_selection -->
Enables or disables the hover selection mode of `self`.
Hover selection makes the selected row follow the pointer.
Currently, this works only for the selection modes
`SelectionMode::Single` and `SelectionMode::Browse`.
## `hover`
`true` to enable hover selection mode
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_level_indentation -->
Sets the amount of extra indentation for child levels to use in `self`
in addition to the default indentation. The value should be specified in
pixels, a value of 0 disables this feature and in this case only the default
indentation will be used.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `indentation`
the amount, in pixels, of extra indentation in `self`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_model -->
Sets the model for a `TreeView`. If the `self` already has a model
set, it will remove it before setting the new model. If `model` is `None`,
then it will unset the old model.
## `model`
The model.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_reorderable -->
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder
models that support the `TreeDragSourceIface` and the
`TreeDragDestIface`. Both `TreeStore` and `ListStore` support
these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then the user can reorder the
model by dragging and dropping rows. The developer can listen to
these changes by connecting to the model’s `TreeModel::row-inserted`
and `TreeModel::row-deleted` signals. The reordering is implemented
by setting up the tree view as a drag source and destination.
Therefore, drag and drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any
other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed. If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the tree can be reordered.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_row_separator_func -->
Sets the row separator function, which is used to determine
whether a row should be drawn as a separator. If the row separator
function is `None`, no separators are drawn. This is the default value.
## `func`
a ``GtkTreeViewRowSeparatorFunc``
## `data`
user data to pass to `func`, or `None`
## `destroy`
destroy notifier for `data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_rubber_banding -->

is `SelectionMode::Multiple`, rubber banding will allow the user to select
multiple rows by dragging the mouse.
## `enable`
`true` to enable rubber banding
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_column -->
Sets `column` as the column where the interactive search code should
search in for the current model.

If the search column is set, users can use the “start-interactive-search”
key binding to bring up search popup. The enable-search property controls
whether simply typing text will also start an interactive search.

Note that `column` refers to a column of the current model. The search
column is reset to -1 when the model is changed.
## `column`
the column of the model to search in, or -1 to disable searching
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_entry -->
Sets the entry which the interactive search code will use for this
`self`. This is useful when you want to provide a search entry
in our interface at all time at a fixed position. Passing `None` for
`entry` will make the interactive search code use the built-in popup
entry again.
## `entry`
the entry the interactive search code of `self` should use or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_search_equal_func -->
Sets the compare function for the interactive search capabilities; note
that somewhat like `strcmp` returning 0 for equality
``GtkTreeViewSearchEqualFunc`` returns `false` on matches.
## `search_equal_func`
the compare function to use during the search
## `search_user_data`
user data to pass to `search_equal_func`, or `None`
## `search_destroy`
Destroy notifier for `search_user_data`, or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_show_expanders -->
Sets whether to draw and enable expanders and indent child rows in
`self`. When disabled there will be no expanders visible in trees
and there will be no way to expand and collapse rows by default. Also
note that hiding the expanders will disable the default indentation. You
can set a custom indentation in this case using
`TreeViewExt::set_level_indentation`.
This does not have any visible effects for lists.
## `enabled`
`true` to enable expander drawing, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_cell -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area `path`, `column` and `cell` have
in common. For example if `path` is `None` and `column` is set, the tip
area will be set to the full area covered by `column`. See also
`Tooltip::set_tip_area`.

Note that if `path` is not specified and `cell` is set and part of a column
containing the expander, the tooltip might not show and hide at the correct
position. In such cases `path` must be set to the current node under the
mouse cursor for this function to operate correctly.

See also `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath` or `None`
## `column`
a `TreeViewColumn` or `None`
## `cell`
a `CellRenderer` or `None`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_column -->
If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full rows, you
can use this function to have `TreeView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `self`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `Widget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`self` will connect a `Widget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `Tooltip::set_markup`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.
## `column`
an integer, which is a valid column number for `self`’s model
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_tooltip_row -->
Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the row at `path`.
See also `TreeViewExt::set_tooltip_column` for a simpler alternative.
See also `Tooltip::set_tip_area`.
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`
## `path`
a `TreePath`
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn unset_rows_drag_dest -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeViewExt::enable_model_drag_dest`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn unset_rows_drag_source -->
Undoes the effect of
`TreeViewExt::enable_model_drag_source`. Calling this method sets
`TreeView:reorderable` to `false`.

<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_cursor_changed -->
The position of the cursor (focused cell) has changed.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_move_cursor -->
The `TreeView::move-cursor` signal is a [keybinding
signal][`SignalAction`] which gets emitted when the user
presses one of the cursor keys.

Applications should not connect to it, but may emit it with
`g_signal_emit_by_name` if they need to control the cursor
programmatically. In contrast to `TreeViewExt::set_cursor` and
`TreeViewExt::set_cursor_on_cell` when moving horizontally
`TreeView::move-cursor` does not reset the current selection.
## `step`
the granularity of the move, as a `MovementStep`.
 `MovementStep::LogicalPositions`, `MovementStep::VisualPositions`,
 `MovementStep::DisplayLines`, `MovementStep::Pages` and
 `MovementStep::BufferEnds` are supported.
 `MovementStep::LogicalPositions` and `MovementStep::VisualPositions`
 are treated identically.
## `direction`
the direction to move: +1 to move forwards; -1 to move
 backwards. The resulting movement is undefined for all other values.
## `extend`
whether to extend the selection
## `modify`
whether to modify the selection

# Returns

`true` if `step` is supported, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn connect_row_activated -->
The "row-activated" signal is emitted when the method
`TreeViewExt::row_activated` is called, when the user double
clicks a treeview row with the "activate-on-single-click"
property set to `false`, or when the user single clicks a row when
the "activate-on-single-click" property set to `true`. It is also
emitted when a non-editable row is selected and one of the keys:
Space, Shift+Space, Return or Enter is pressed.

For selection handling refer to the
[tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
as well as `TreeSelection`.

Currently, this works only for the selection modes
`SelectionMode::Single` and `SelectionMode::Browse`.

This mode is primarily intended for treeviews in popups, e.g.
in `ComboBox` or `EntryCompletion`.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_property_level_indentation -->
Extra indentation for each level.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_property_level_indentation -->
Extra indentation for each level.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn get_property_show_expanders -->
`true` if the view has expanders.
<!-- trait TreeViewExt::fn set_property_show_expanders -->
`true` if the view has expanders.
<!-- struct TreeViewColumn -->
The `TreeViewColumn` object represents a visible column in a `TreeView` widget.
It allows to set properties of the column header, and functions as a holding pen for
the cell renderers which determine how the data in the column is displayed.

Please refer to the [tree widget conceptual overview][TreeWidget]
for an overview of all the objects and data types related to the tree widget and how
they work together.

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`BuildableExt`](trait.BuildableExt.html), [`CellLayoutExt`](trait.CellLayoutExt.html)
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn new -->
Creates a new `TreeViewColumn`.

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn new_with_area -->
Creates a new `TreeViewColumn` using `area` to render its cells.
## `area`
the `CellArea` that the newly created column should use to layout cells.

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn new_with_attributes -->
Creates a new `TreeViewColumn` with a number of default values.
This is equivalent to calling `TreeViewColumn::set_title`,
`TreeViewColumn::pack_start`, and
`TreeViewColumn::set_attributes` on the newly created `TreeViewColumn`.

Here’s a simple example:

```C
 enum { TEXT_COLUMN, COLOR_COLUMN, N_COLUMNS };
 // ...
 {
   GtkTreeViewColumn *column;
   GtkCellRenderer   *renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new ();
 
   column = gtk_tree_view_column_new_with_attributes ("Title",
                                                      renderer,
                                                      "text", TEXT_COLUMN,
                                                      "foreground", COLOR_COLUMN,
                                                      NULL);

The title to set the header to
## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`

# Returns

A newly created `TreeViewColumn`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn add_attribute -->
Adds an attribute mapping to the list in `self`. The `column` is the
column of the model to get a value from, and the `attribute` is the

if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a `CellRendererText` get its values from
column 2.

## `attribute`
An attribute on the renderer
## `column`
The column position on the model to get the attribute from.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_get_position -->

## `x_offset`
return location for the horizontal
 position of `cell` within `self`, may be `None`

return location for the width of `cell`,
 may be `None`

# Returns

`true` if `cell` belongs to `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_get_size -->

# Returns

`true`, if any of the cells packed into the `self` are currently visible
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn cell_set_cell_data -->
Sets the cell renderer based on the `tree_model` and `iter`. That is, for
every attribute mapping in `self`, it will get a value from the set
column on the `iter`, and use that value to set the attribute on the cell
renderer. This is used primarily by the `TreeView`.
## `tree_model`
The `TreeModel` to get the cell renderers attributes from.
## `iter`
The `TreeIter` to get the cell renderer’s attributes from.
## `is_expander`
`true`, if the row has children

The current X offset of `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn pack_end -->
Adds the `cell` to end of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then the `cell`
is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.
## `cell`
The `CellRenderer`.
## `expand`
`true` if `cell` is to be given extra space allocated to `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn pack_start -->
Packs the `cell` into the beginning of the column. If `expand` is `false`, then
the `cell` is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided
evenly between cells for which `expand` is `true`.
## `cell`

<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn queue_resize -->
Flags the column, and the cell renderers added to this column, to have
their sizes renegotiated.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_alignment -->
Sets the alignment of the title or custom widget inside the column header.
The alignment determines its location inside the button -- 0.0 for left, 0.5
for center, 1.0 for right.
## `xalign`
The alignment, which is between [0.0 and 1.0] inclusive.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_attributes -->
Sets the attributes in the list as the attributes of `self`.
The attributes should be in attribute/column order, as in
`TreeViewColumn::add_attribute`. All existing attributes
are removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
## `cell_renderer`
the `CellRenderer` we’re setting the attributes of
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_cell_data_func -->
Sets the ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use for the column. This
function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping for
setting the column value, and should set the value of `self`'s
cell renderer as appropriate. `func` may be `None` to remove an
older one.
## `cell_renderer`
A `CellRenderer`
## `func`
The ``GtkTreeCellDataFunc`` to use.
## `func_data`
The user data for `func`.
## `destroy`
The destroy notification for `func_data`
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_clickable -->
Sets the header to be active if `clickable` is `true`. When the header is
active, then it can take keyboard focus, and can be clicked.
## `clickable`
`true` if the header is active.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_expand -->
Sets the column to take available extra space. This space is shared equally
amongst all columns that have the expand set to `true`. If no column has this
option set, then the last column gets all extra space. By default, every
column is created with this `false`.

Along with “fixed-width”, the “expand” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `expand`
`true` if the column should expand to fill available space.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_fixed_width -->
If `fixed_width` is not -1, sets the fixed width of `self`; otherwise
unsets it. The effective value of `fixed_width` is clamped between the
minimum and maximum width of the column; however, the value stored in the
“fixed-width” property is not clamped. If the column sizing is
`TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly` or `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, setting
a fixed width overrides the automatically calculated width. Note that
`fixed_width` is only a hint to GTK; the width actually allocated to the
column may be greater or less than requested.

Along with “expand”, the “fixed-width” property changes when the column is
resized by the user.
## `fixed_width`
The new fixed width, in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_max_width -->
Sets the maximum width of the `self`. If `max_width` is -1, then the
maximum width is unset. Note, the column can actually be wider than max
width if it’s the last column in a view. In this case, the column expands to
fill any extra space.
## `max_width`
The maximum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_min_width -->
Sets the minimum width of the `self`. If `min_width` is -1, then the
minimum width is unset.
## `min_width`
The minimum width of the column in pixels, or -1.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_reorderable -->
If `reorderable` is `true`, then the column can be reordered by the end user
dragging the header.
## `reorderable`
`true`, if the column can be reordered.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_resizable -->
If `resizable` is `true`, then the user can explicitly resize the column by
grabbing the outer edge of the column button. If resizable is `true` and
sizing mode of the column is `TreeViewColumnSizing::Autosize`, then the sizing
mode is changed to `TreeViewColumnSizing::GrowOnly`.
## `resizable`
`true`, if the column can be resized
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sizing -->
Sets the growth behavior of `self` to `type_`.
## `type_`
The `TreeViewColumnSizing`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_column_id -->
Sets the logical `sort_column_id` that this column sorts on when this column
is selected for sorting. Doing so makes the column header clickable.
## `sort_column_id`
The `sort_column_id` of the model to sort on.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_indicator -->
Call this function with a `setting` of `true` to display an arrow in
the header button indicating the column is sorted. Call
`TreeViewColumn::set_sort_order` to change the direction of
the arrow.
## `setting`
`true` to display an indicator that the column is sorted
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_sort_order -->
Changes the appearance of the sort indicator.

This does not actually sort the model. Use
`TreeViewColumn::set_sort_column_id` if you want automatic sorting
support. This function is primarily for custom sorting behavior, and should
be used in conjunction with `TreeSortable::set_sort_column_id` to do
that. For custom models, the mechanism will vary.

The sort indicator changes direction to indicate normal sort or reverse sort.
Note that you must have the sort indicator enabled to see anything when
calling this function; see `TreeViewColumn::set_sort_indicator`.
## `order`
sort order that the sort indicator should indicate
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_spacing -->
Sets the spacing field of `self`, which is the number of pixels to
place between cell renderers packed into it.
## `spacing`
distance between cell renderers in pixels.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `self`. If a custom widget has been set, then
this value is ignored.
## `title`
The title of the `self`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility of `self`.
## `visible`
`true` if the `self` is visible.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_widget -->
Sets the widget in the header to be `widget`. If widget is `None`, then the
header button is set with a `Label` set to the title of `self`.
## `widget`
A child `Widget`, or `None`.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn connect_clicked -->
Emitted when the column's header has been clicked.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn get_property_cell_area -->
The `CellArea` used to layout cell renderers for this column.

If no area is specified when creating the tree view column with `TreeViewColumn::new_with_area`
a horizontally oriented `CellAreaBox` will be used.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_property_cell_area -->
The `CellArea` used to layout cell renderers for this column.

If no area is specified when creating the tree view column with `TreeViewColumn::new_with_area`
a horizontally oriented `CellAreaBox` will be used.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn get_property_sort_column_id -->
Logical sort column ID this column sorts on when selected for sorting. Setting the sort column ID makes the column header
clickable. Set to -1 to make the column unsortable.
<!-- impl TreeViewColumn::fn set_property_sort_column_id -->
Logical sort column ID this column sorts on when selected for sorting. Setting the sort column ID makes the column header
clickable. Set to -1 to make the column unsortable.
<!-- enum TreeViewColumnSizing -->

<!-- struct Video -->
`Video` is a widget to show a `MediaStream` with media controls
as provided by `MediaControls`. If you just want to display a
video without controls, you can treat it like any other paintable
and for example put it into a `Picture`.

`Video` aims to cover use cases such as previews, embedded animations,
etc. It supports autoplay, looping, and simple media controls. It does
not have support for video overlays, multichannel audio, device
selection, or input. If you are writing a full-fledged video player,
you may want to use the `gdk::Paintable` API and a media framework such
as Gstreamer directly.

<!-- struct Widget -->
`Widget` is the base class all widgets in GTK derive from. It manages the
widget lifecycle, states and style.

# Height-for-width Geometry Management # {`geometry`-management}

GTK uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.

Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK by way
of two virtual methods:

- `WidgetClass.get_request_mode`()
- `WidgetClass.measure`()

There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
height-for-width and when using it in widget implementations.

If you implement a direct `Widget` subclass that supports
height-for-width or width-for-height geometry management for
itself or its child widgets, the `WidgetClass.get_request_mode`()
virtual function must be implemented as well and return the widget's
preferred request mode. The default implementation of this virtual function
returns `SizeRequestMode::ConstantSize`, which means that the widget will
only ever get -1 passed as the for_size value to its `WidgetClass.measure`()
implementation.

The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
in the `SizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.

For example, when queried in the normal
`SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` mode:
First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
in the interface will be computed using `WidgetExt::measure` with an
orientation of `Orientation::Horizontal` and a for_size of -1.
Because the preferred widths for each widget depend on the preferred
widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
minimum height contextual to that width using `WidgetExt::measure` with an
orientation of `Orientation::Vertical` and a for_size of the just computed
width. This will also be a highly recursive operation. The minimum height
for the minimum width is normally used to set the minimum size constraint
on the toplevel.

After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
previously specified with `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size`). During the
recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
will be recursively executed while widgets allocate their children.
Each widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
depending. In this way a `Widget` will typically be requested its size
a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
requested. For this reason, `Widget` caches a small number of results
to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.

If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
allocated size then it must support the request in both
``GtkSizeRequestModes`` even if the widget in question only
trades sizes in a single orientation.

For instance, a `Label` that does height-for-width word wrapping
will not expect to have `WidgetClass.measure`() with an orientation of
`Orientation::Vertical` called because that call is specific to a
width-for-height request. In this
case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
at least enough space to fit its own content.

Here are some examples of how a `SizeRequestMode::HeightForWidth` widget
generally deals with width-for-height requests:


```C
static void
foo_widget_measure (GtkWidget      *widget,
                    GtkOrientation  orientation,
                    int             for_size,
                    int            *minimum_size,
                    int            *natural_size,
                    int            *minimum_baseline,
                    int            *natural_baseline)
{
  if (orientation == GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL)
    {
      // Calculate minimum and natural width
    }
  else // VERTICAL
    {
       if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
         {
           int min_width, dummy;

           // First, get the minimum width of our widget
           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, -1,
                                                   &min_width, &dummy, &dummy, &dummy);

           // Now use the minimum width to retrieve the minimum and natural height to display
           // that width.
           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, min_width,
                                                   minimum_size, natural_size, &dummy, &dummy);
         }
       else
         {
           // ... some widgets do both.
         }
   }
}
```

Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like in the code
example above.

It will not work to use the wrapper function `WidgetExt::measure`
inside your own `WidgetClass.size-allocate`() implementation.
These return a request adjusted by `SizeGroup`, the widget's align and expand flags
as well as its CSS style.
If a widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
twice. GTK therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
to do it.

Of course if you are getting the size request for
another widget, such as a child widget, you must use `WidgetExt::measure`.
Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
`SizeGroup`, and so forth.

GTK also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
has a vertical alignment of `Align::Baseline`, and is inside a widget
that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.

Baseline alignment support for a widget is also done by the `WidgetClass.measure`()
virtual function. It allows you to report both a minimum and natural size.

If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
as if it was `Align::Fill`, but the selected baseline can be found via `WidgetExt::get_allocated_baseline`.
If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
appears at the position.

# `Widget` as `Buildable`

The `Widget` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports a
custom elements to specify various aspects of widgets that are not
directly expressed as properties.

If the parent widget uses a `LayoutManager`, `Widget` supports a
custom `<layout>` element, used to define layout properties:


```C
static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...

  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
}
```

You will also need to call `WidgetExt::init_template` from the instance
initialization function:


```C
static void
foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
}
```

You can access widgets defined in the template using the
`WidgetExt::get_template_child` function, but you will typically declare
a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
name as the widget in the template definition, and call
`gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private` with that name, e.g.


```C
typedef struct {
  GtkWidget *hello_button;
  GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
} FooWidgetPrivate;

G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, hello_button);
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                FooWidget, goodbye_button);
}

static void
foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
{

}
```

You can also use `gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback` to connect a signal
callback defined in the template with a function visible in the scope of the
class, e.g.


```C
// the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
// because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
static void
hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
                      GtkButton *button)
{
  g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
}

static void
foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
{
  // ...
  gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                               "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);
}
```

This is an Abstract Base Class, you cannot instantiate it.

<!-- impl Widget::fn get_default_direction -->
Obtains the current default reading direction. See
`Widget::set_default_direction`.

# Returns

the current default direction.
<!-- impl Widget::fn set_default_direction -->
Sets the default reading direction for widgets where the
direction has not been explicitly set by `WidgetExt::set_direction`.
## `dir`
the new default direction. This cannot be
 `TextDirection::None`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn action_set_enabled -->
Enable or disable an action installed with
`WidgetClass::install_action`.
## `action_name`
action name, such as "clipboard.paste"
## `enabled`
whether the action is now enabled
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate -->
For widgets that can be “activated” (buttons, menu items, etc.)
this function activates them. The activation will emit the signal
set using `WidgetClass::set_activate_signal` during class
initialization.

Activation is what happens when you press Enter on a widget during
key navigation.

If you wish to handle the activation keybinding yourself, it is
recommended to use `WidgetClass::add_shortcut` with an action
created with `SignalAction::new`.

If `self` isn't activatable, the function returns `false`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget was activatable
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate_action -->
Looks up the action in the action groups associated
with `self` and its ancestors, and activates it.

This is a wrapper around `WidgetExt::activate_action_variant`
that constructs the `args` variant according to `format_string`.
## `name`
the name of the action to activate
## `format_string`
GVariant format string for arguments or `None`
 for no arguments

# Returns

`true` if the action was activated, `false` if the action does
 not exist.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate_action_variant -->
Looks up the action in the action groups associated
with `self` and its ancestors, and activates it.

If the action is in an action group added with
`WidgetExt::insert_action_group`, the `name` is
expected to be prefixed with the prefix that was
used when the group was inserted.

The arguments must match the actions expected parameter
type, as returned by `gio::Action::get_parameter_type`.
## `name`
the name of the action to activate
## `args`
parameters to use, or `None`

# Returns

`true` if the action was activated, `false` if the action does
 not exist.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn activate_default -->
Activate the default.activate action from `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_controller -->
Adds `controller` to `self` so that it will receive events. You will
usually want to call this function right after creating any kind of
`EventController`.
## `controller`
a `EventController` that hasn't been
 added to a widget yet
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_css_class -->
Adds `css_class` to `self`. After calling this function, `self`'s
style will match for `css_class`, after the CSS matching rules.
## `css_class`
The style class to add to `self`, without
 the leading '.' used for notation of style classes
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn add_mnemonic_label -->
Adds a widget to the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). Note the
list of mnemonic labels for the widget is cleared when the
widget is destroyed, so the caller must make sure to update
its internal state at this point as well, by using a connection
to the `Widget::destroy` signal or a weak notifier.
## `label`
a `Widget` that acts as a mnemonic label for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExtManual::fn add_tick_callback -->
Queues an animation frame update and adds a callback to be called
before each frame. Until the tick callback is removed, it will be
called frequently (usually at the frame rate of the output device
or as quickly as the application can be repainted, whichever is
slower). For this reason, is most suitable for handling graphics
that change every frame or every few frames. The tick callback does
not automatically imply a relayout or repaint. If you want a
repaint or relayout, and aren’t changing widget properties that
would trigger that (for example, changing the text of a `Label`),
then you will have to call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` or
`WidgetExt::queue_draw` yourself.

`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` should generally be used for timing
continuous animations and
`gdk::FrameTimings::get_predicted_presentation_time` if you are
trying to display isolated frames at particular times.

This is a more convenient alternative to connecting directly to the
`gdk::FrameClock::update` signal of `gdk::FrameClock`, since you don't
have to worry about when a `gdk::FrameClock` is assigned to a widget.
## `callback`
function to call for updating animations
## `user_data`
data to pass to `callback`
## `notify`
function to call to free `user_data` when the callback is removed.

# Returns

an id for the connection of this callback. Remove the callback
 by passing the id returned from this function to
 `Widget::remove_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn allocate -->
This function is only used by `Widget` subclasses, to assign a size,
position and (optionally) baseline to their child widgets.

In this function, the allocation and baseline may be adjusted. The given
allocation will be forced to be bigger than the widget's minimum size,
as well as at least 0×0 in size.

For a version that does not take a transform, see `WidgetExt::size_allocate`
## `width`
New width of `self`
## `height`
New height of `self`
## `baseline`
New baseline of `self`, or -1
## `transform`
Transformation to be applied to `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn child_focus -->
This function is used by custom widget implementations; if you're
writing an app, you’d use `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to move the focus
to a particular widget.

`WidgetExt::child_focus` is called by widgets as the user moves
around the window using keyboard shortcuts. `direction` indicates
what kind of motion is taking place (up, down, left, right, tab
forward, tab backward). `WidgetExt::child_focus` calls the
`WidgetClass.focus`() vfunc; widgets override this vfunc
in order to implement appropriate focus behavior.

The default `focus` vfunc for a widget should return `true` if
moving in `direction` left the focus on a focusable location inside
that widget, and `false` if moving in `direction` moved the focus
outside the widget. If returning `true`, widgets normally
call `WidgetExt::grab_focus` to place the focus accordingly;
if returning `false`, they don’t modify the current focus location.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if focus ended up inside `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_bounds -->
Computes the bounds for `self` in the coordinate space of `target`.
FIXME: Explain what "bounds" are.

If the operation is successful, `true` is returned. If `self` has no
bounds or the bounds cannot be expressed in `target`'s coordinate space
(for example if both widgets are in different windows), `false` is
returned and `bounds` is set to the zero rectangle.

It is valid for `self` and `target` to be the same widget.
## `target`
the `Widget`
## `out_bounds`
the rectangle taking the bounds

# Returns

`true` if the bounds could be computed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_expand -->
Computes whether a container should give this widget extra space
when possible. Containers should check this, rather than
looking at `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` or `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`.

This function already checks whether the widget is visible, so
visibility does not need to be checked separately. Non-visible
widgets are not expanded.

The computed expand value uses either the expand setting explicitly
set on the widget itself, or, if none has been explicitly set,
the widget may expand if some of its children do.
## `orientation`
expand direction

# Returns

whether widget tree rooted here should be expanded
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_point -->
Translates the given `point` in `self`'s coordinates to coordinates
relative to `target`’s coordinate system. In order to perform this
operation, both widgets must share a common root.
## `target`
the `Widget` to transform into
## `point`
a point in `self`'s coordinate system
## `out_point`
Set to the corresponding coordinates in
 `target`'s coordinate system

# Returns

`true` if the point could be determined, `false` on failure.
 In this case, 0 is stored in `out_point`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn compute_transform -->
Computes a matrix suitable to describe a transformation from
`self`'s coordinate system into `target`'s coordinate system.
## `target`
the target widget that the matrix will transform to
## `out_transform`
location to
 store the final transformation

# Returns

`true` if the transform could be computed, `false` otherwise.
 The transform can not be computed in certain cases, for example when
 `self` and `target` do not share a common ancestor. In that
 case `out_transform` gets set to the identity matrix.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn contains -->
Tests if the point at (`x`, `y`) is contained in `self`.

The coordinates for (`x`, `y`) must be in widget coordinates, so
(0, 0) is assumed to be the top left of `self`'s content area.
## `x`
X coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `y`
Y coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin

# Returns

`true` if `self` contains (`x`, `y`).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_context -->
Creates a new `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map,
font options, font description, and base direction for drawing
text for this widget. See also `WidgetExt::get_pango_context`.

# Returns

the new `pango::Context`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn create_pango_layout -->
Creates a new `pango::Layout` with the appropriate font map,
font description, and base direction for drawing text for
this widget.

If you keep a `pango::Layout` created in this way around, you need
to re-create it when the widget `pango::Context` is replaced.
This can be tracked by listening to changes of the `Widget:root` property
on the widget.
## `text`
text to set on the layout (can be `None`)

# Returns

the new `pango::Layout`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn drag_check_threshold -->
Checks to see if a mouse drag starting at (`start_x`, `start_y`) and ending
at (`current_x`, `current_y`) has passed the GTK drag threshold, and thus
should trigger the beginning of a drag-and-drop operation.
## `start_x`
X coordinate of start of drag
## `start_y`
Y coordinate of start of drag
## `current_x`
current X coordinate
## `current_y`
current Y coordinate

# Returns

`true` if the drag threshold has been passed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn error_bell -->
Notifies the user about an input-related error on this widget.
If the `Settings:gtk-error-bell` setting is `true`, it calls
`gdk::Surface::beep`, otherwise it does nothing.

Note that the effect of `gdk::Surface::beep` can be configured in many
ways, depending on the windowing backend and the desktop environment
or window manager that is used.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_baseline -->
Returns the baseline that has currently been allocated to `self`.
This function is intended to be used when implementing handlers
for the `WidgetClass.snapshot`() function, and when allocating child
widgets in `WidgetClass.size_allocate`().

# Returns

the baseline of the `self`, or -1 if none
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_height -->
Returns the height that has currently been allocated to `self`.

# Returns

the height of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocated_width -->
Returns the width that has currently been allocated to `self`.

# Returns

the width of the `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_allocation -->
Retrieves the widget’s allocation.

Note, when implementing a layout container: a widget’s allocation
will be its “adjusted” allocation, that is, the widget’s parent
typically calls `WidgetExt::size_allocate` with an allocation,
and that allocation is then adjusted (to handle margin
and alignment for example) before assignment to the widget.
`WidgetExt::get_allocation` returns the adjusted allocation that
was actually assigned to the widget. The adjusted allocation is
guaranteed to be completely contained within the
`WidgetExt::size_allocate` allocation, however.

So a layout container is guaranteed that its children stay inside
the assigned bounds, but not that they have exactly the bounds the
container assigned.
## `allocation`
a pointer to a `Allocation` to copy to
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_ancestor -->
Gets the first ancestor of `self` with type `widget_type`. For example,
`gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)` gets
the first `Box` that’s an ancestor of `self`. No reference will be
added to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced.

Note that unlike `WidgetExt::is_ancestor`, `WidgetExt::get_ancestor`
considers `self` to be an ancestor of itself.
## `widget_type`
ancestor type

# Returns

the ancestor widget, or `None` if not found
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_focus -->
Determines whether the input focus can enter `self` or any
of its children.

See `WidgetExt::set_focusable`.

# Returns

`true` if the input focus can enter `self`, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_can_target -->
Queries whether `self` can be the target of pointer events.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can receive pointer events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_child_visible -->
Gets the value set with `WidgetExt::set_child_visible`.
If you feel a need to use this function, your code probably
needs reorganization.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped with the parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_clipboard -->
This is a utility function to get the clipboard object for the
`gdk::Display` that `self` is using.

Note that this function always works, even when `self` is not
realized yet.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_css_classes -->
Returns the list of css classes applied to `self`.

# Returns

a `None`-terminated list of
 css classes currently applied to `self`. The returned
 list can be freed using `g_strfreev`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_css_name -->
Returns the CSS name that is used for `self`.

# Returns

the CSS name
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_cursor -->
Queries the cursor set via `WidgetExt::set_cursor`. See that function for
details.

# Returns

the cursor currently in use or `None`
 to use the default.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_direction -->
Gets the reading direction for a particular widget. See
`WidgetExt::set_direction`.

# Returns

the reading direction for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_display -->
Get the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel window associated with
this widget. This function can only be called after the widget
has been added to a widget hierarchy with a `Window` at the top.

In general, you should only create display specific
resources when a widget has been realized, and you should
free those resources when the widget is unrealized.

# Returns

the `gdk::Display` for the toplevel for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_first_child -->
Returns the widgets first child.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations.

# Returns

The widget's first child
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_focus_child -->
Returns the current focus child of `self`.

# Returns

The current focus child of `self`,
 or `None` in case the focus child is unset.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_focus_on_click -->
Returns whether the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with the mouse.
See `WidgetExt::set_focus_on_click`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with
 the mouse.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_focusable -->
Determines whether `self` can own the input focus.
See `WidgetExt::set_focusable`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` can own the input focus, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_font_map -->
Gets the font map that has been set with `WidgetExt::set_font_map`.

# Returns

A `pango::FontMap`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_font_options -->
Returns the `cairo::FontOptions` used for Pango rendering. When not set,
the defaults font options for the `gdk::Display` will be used.

# Returns

the `cairo::FontOptions` or `None` if not set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_frame_clock -->
Obtains the frame clock for a widget. The frame clock is a global
“ticker” that can be used to drive animations and repaints. The
most common reason to get the frame clock is to call
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, in order to get a time to use for
animating. For example you might record the start of the animation
with an initial value from `gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time`, and
then update the animation by calling
`gdk::FrameClock::get_frame_time` again during each repaint.

`gdk::FrameClock::request_phase` will result in a new frame on the
clock, but won’t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint a
widget, you have to use `WidgetExt::queue_draw` which invalidates
the widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the next
frame). `WidgetExt::queue_draw` will also end up requesting a frame
on the appropriate frame clock.

A widget’s frame clock will not change while the widget is
mapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) can
change the widget’s frame clock.

Unrealized widgets do not have a frame clock.

# Returns

a `gdk::FrameClock`,
or `None` if widget is unrealized
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_halign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:halign` property.

For backwards compatibility reasons this method will never return
`Align::Baseline`, but instead it will convert it to
`Align::Fill`. Baselines are not supported for horizontal
alignment.

# Returns

the horizontal alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_has_tooltip -->
Returns the current value of the has-tooltip property. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.

# Returns

current value of has-tooltip on `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_height -->
Returns the content height of the widget, as passed to its size-allocate implementation.
This is the size you should be using in `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`. For pointer
events, see `WidgetExt::contains`.

# Returns

The height of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Containers should use `WidgetExt::compute_expand` rather than
this function, to see whether a widget, or any of its children,
has the expand flag set. If any child of a widget wants to
expand, the parent may ask to expand also.

This function only looks at the widget’s own hexpand flag, rather
than computing whether the entire widget tree rooted at this widget
wants to expand.

# Returns

whether hexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_hexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.

# Returns

whether hexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_last_child -->
Returns the widgets last child.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations.

# Returns

The widget's last child
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_layout_manager -->
Retrieves the layout manager set using `WidgetExt::set_layout_manager`.

# Returns

a `LayoutManager`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_mapped -->
Whether the widget is mapped.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is mapped, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_bottom -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.

# Returns

The bottom margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_end -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-end` property.

# Returns

The end margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_start -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-start` property.

# Returns

The start margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_margin_top -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:margin-top` property.

# Returns

The top margin of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_widget_name -->
Retrieves the name of a widget. See `WidgetExt::set_name` for the
significance of widget names.

# Returns

name of the widget. This string is owned by GTK and
should not be modified or freed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_native -->
Returns the `Native` widget that contains `self`,
or `None` if the widget is not contained inside a
widget tree with a native ancestor.

`Native` widgets will return themselves here.

# Returns

the `Native`
 widget of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_next_sibling -->
Returns the widgets next sibling.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations.

# Returns

The widget's next sibling
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_opacity -->
Fetches the requested opacity for this widget.
See `WidgetExt::set_opacity`.

# Returns

the requested opacity for this widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_overflow -->
Returns the value set via `WidgetExt::set_overflow`.

# Returns

The widget's overflow.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_pango_context -->
Gets a `pango::Context` with the appropriate font map, font description,
and base direction for this widget. Unlike the context returned
by `WidgetExt::create_pango_context`, this context is owned by
the widget (it can be used until the screen for the widget changes
or the widget is removed from its toplevel), and will be updated to
match any changes to the widget’s attributes. This can be tracked
by listening to changes of the `Widget:root` property on the widget.

# Returns

the `pango::Context` for the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_parent -->
Returns the parent widget of `self`.

# Returns

the parent widget of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_preferred_size -->
Retrieves the minimum and natural size of a widget, taking
into account the widget’s preference for height-for-width management.

This is used to retrieve a suitable size by container widgets which do
not impose any restrictions on the child placement. It can be used
to deduce toplevel window and menu sizes as well as child widgets in
free-form containers such as `GtkLayout`.

Handle with care. Note that the natural height of a height-for-width
widget will generally be a smaller size than the minimum height, since the required
height for the natural width is generally smaller than the required height for
the minimum width.

Use `WidgetExt::measure` if you want to support
baseline alignment.
## `minimum_size`
location for storing the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_size`
location for storing the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_prev_sibling -->
Returns the widgets previous sibling.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations.

# Returns

The widget's previous sibling
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_primary_clipboard -->
This is a utility function to get the primary clipboard object
for the `gdk::Display` that `self` is using.

Note that this function always works, even when `self` is not
realized yet.

# Returns

the appropriate clipboard object.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_realized -->
Determines whether `self` is realized.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is realized, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_receives_default -->
Determines whether `self` is always treated as the default widget
within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if another widget
is the default.

See `WidgetExt::set_receives_default`.

# Returns

`true` if `self` acts as the default widget when focused,
 `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_request_mode -->
Gets whether the widget prefers a height-for-width layout
or a width-for-height layout.

``GtkBin`` widgets generally propagate the preference of
their child, container widgets need to request something either in
context of their children or in context of their allocation
capabilities.

# Returns

The `SizeRequestMode` preferred by `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_root -->
Returns the `Root` widget of `self` or `None` if the widget is not contained
inside a widget tree with a root widget.

`Root` widgets will return themselves here.

# Returns

the root widget of `self`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_scale_factor -->
Retrieves the internal scale factor that maps from window coordinates
to the actual device pixels. On traditional systems this is 1, on
high density outputs, it can be a higher value (typically 2).

See `gdk::Surface::get_scale_factor`.

# Returns

the scale factor for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s sensitivity (in the sense of returning
the value that has been set using `WidgetExt::set_sensitive`).

The effective sensitivity of a widget is however determined by both its
own and its parent widget’s sensitivity. See `WidgetExt::is_sensitive`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_settings -->
Gets the settings object holding the settings used for this widget.

Note that this function can only be called when the `Widget`
is attached to a toplevel, since the settings object is specific
to a particular `gdk::Display`. If you want to monitor the widget for
changes in its settings, connect to notify::display.

# Returns

the relevant `Settings` object
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_size -->
Returns the content width or height of the widget, depending on `orientation`.
This is equivalent to calling `WidgetExt::get_width` for `Orientation::Horizontal`
or `WidgetExt::get_height` for `Orientation::Vertical`, but can be used when
writing orientation-independent code, such as when implementing `Orientable`
widgets.
## `orientation`
the orientation to query

# Returns

The size of `self` in `orientation`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_size_request -->
Gets the size request that was explicitly set for the widget using
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. A value of -1 stored in `width` or
`height` indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitly
and the natural requisition of the widget will be used instead. See
`WidgetExt::set_size_request`. To get the size a widget will
actually request, call `WidgetExt::measure` instead of
this function.
## `width`
return location for width, or `None`
## `height`
return location for height, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_state_flags -->
Returns the widget state as a flag set. It is worth mentioning
that the effective `StateFlags::Insensitive` state will be
returned, that is, also based on parent insensitivity, even if
`self` itself is sensitive.

Also note that if you are looking for a way to obtain the
`StateFlags` to pass to a `StyleContext` method, you
should look at `StyleContextExt::get_state`.

# Returns

The state flags for widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_style_context -->
Returns the style context associated to `self`. The returned object is
guaranteed to be the same for the lifetime of `self`.

# Returns

a `StyleContext`. This memory is owned by `self` and
 must not be freed.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_template_child -->
Fetch an object build from the template XML for `widget_type` in this `self` instance.

This will only report children which were previously declared with
`WidgetClass::bind_template_child_full` or one of its
variants.

This function is only meant to be called for code which is private to the `widget_type` which
declared the child and is meant for language bindings which cannot easily make use
of the GObject structure offsets.
## `widget_type`
The `glib::Type` to get a template child for
## `name`
The “id” of the child defined in the template XML

# Returns

The object built in the template XML with the id `name`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_markup -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self` set using
`WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup`.

# Returns

the tooltip text
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_tooltip_text -->
Gets the contents of the tooltip for `self`.

If the `self`'s tooltip was set using `WidgetExt::set_tooltip_markup`,
this function will return the escaped text.

# Returns

the tooltip text
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_valign -->
Gets the value of the `Widget:valign` property.

# Returns

the vertical alignment of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand -->
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand flag is set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_vexpand_set -->
Gets whether `WidgetExt::set_vexpand` has been used to
explicitly set the expand flag on this widget.

See `WidgetExt::get_hexpand_set` for more detail.

# Returns

whether vexpand has been explicitly set
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_visible -->
Determines whether the widget is visible. If you want to
take into account whether the widget’s parent is also marked as
visible, use `WidgetExt::is_visible` instead.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See `WidgetExt::set_visible`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget is visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_width -->
Returns the content width of the widget, as passed to its size-allocate implementation.
This is the size you should be using in `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`. For pointer
events, see `WidgetExt::contains`.

# Returns

The width of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn grab_focus -->
Causes `self` (or one of its descendents) to have the keyboard focus
for the `Window` it's inside.

If `self` is not focusable, or its ::grab_focus implementation cannot
transfer the focus to a descendant of `self` that is focusable, it will
not take focus and `false` will be returned.

Calling `WidgetExt::grab_focus` on an already focused widget is allowed,
should not have an effect, and return `true`.

# Returns

`true` if focus is now inside `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_css_class -->
Returns whether `css_class` is currently applied to `self`.
## `css_class`
A CSS style class, without the leading '.'
 used for notation of style classes

# Returns

`true` if `css_class` is currently applied to `self`,
 `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_default -->
Determines whether `self` is the current default widget within its
toplevel.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is the current default widget within
 its toplevel, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_focus -->
Determines if the widget has the global input focus. See
`WidgetExt::is_focus` for the difference between having the global
input focus, and only having the focus within a toplevel.

# Returns

`true` if the widget has the global input focus.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn has_visible_focus -->
Determines if the widget should show a visible indication that
it has the global input focus. This is a convenience function
that takes into account whether focus indication should currently
be shown in the toplevel window of `self`.
See `GtkWindowExt::get_focus_visible` for more information
about focus indication.

To find out if the widget has the global input focus, use
`WidgetExt::has_focus`.

# Returns

`true` if the widget should display a “focus rectangle”
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn hide -->
Reverses the effects of `WidgetExt::show`, causing the widget to be
hidden (invisible to the user).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn in_destruction -->
Returns whether the widget is currently being destroyed.
This information can sometimes be used to avoid doing
unnecessary work.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is being destroyed
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn init_template -->
Creates and initializes child widgets defined in templates. This
function must be called in the instance initializer for any
class which assigned itself a template using `WidgetClass::set_template`

It is important to call this function in the instance initializer
of a `Widget` subclass and not in `gobject::Object.constructed`() or
`gobject::Object.constructor`() for two reasons.

One reason is that generally derived widgets will assume that parent
class composite widgets have been created in their instance
initializers.

Another reason is that when calling `gobject::Object::new` on a widget with
composite templates, it’s important to build the composite widgets
before the construct properties are set. Properties passed to `gobject::Object::new`
should take precedence over properties set in the private template XML.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_action_group -->
Inserts `group` into `self`. Children of `self` that implement
`Actionable` can then be associated with actions in `group` by
setting their “action-name” to `prefix`.`action-name`.

Note that inheritance is defined for individual actions. I.e.
even if you insert a group with prefix `prefix`, actions with
the same prefix will still be inherited from the parent, unless
the group contains an action with the same name.

If `group` is `None`, a previously inserted group for `name` is
removed from `self`.
## `name`
the prefix for actions in `group`
## `group`
a `gio::ActionGroup`, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_after -->
Inserts `self` into the child widget list of `parent`.

It will be placed after `previous_sibling`, or at the beginning if
`previous_sibling` is `None`.

After calling this function, gtk_widget_get_prev_sibling(widget) will
return `previous_sibling`.

If `parent` is already set as the parent widget of `self`, this function
can also be used to reorder `self` in the child widget list of `parent`.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations; if you are
just using a widget, you *must* use its own API for adding children.
## `parent`
the parent `Widget` to insert `self` into
## `previous_sibling`
the new previous sibling of `self` or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn insert_before -->
Inserts `self` into the child widget list of `parent`.

It will be placed before `next_sibling`, or at the end if
`next_sibling` is `None`.

After calling this function, gtk_widget_get_next_sibling(widget)
will return `next_sibling`.

If `parent` is already set as the parent widget of `self`, this function
can also be used to reorder `self` in the child widget list of `parent`.

This API is primarily meant for widget implementations; if you are
just using a widget, you *must* use its own API for adding children.
## `parent`
the parent `Widget` to insert `self` into
## `next_sibling`
the new next sibling of `self` or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_ancestor -->
Determines whether `self` is somewhere inside `ancestor`, possibly with
intermediate containers.
## `ancestor`
another `Widget`

# Returns

`true` if `ancestor` contains `self` as a child,
 grandchild, great grandchild, etc.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_drawable -->
Determines whether `self` can be drawn to. A widget can be drawn
if it is mapped and visible.

# Returns

`true` if `self` is drawable, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_focus -->
Determines if the widget is the focus widget within its
toplevel. (This does not mean that the `Widget:has-focus` property is
necessarily set; `Widget:has-focus` will only be set if the
toplevel widget additionally has the global input focus.)

# Returns

`true` if the widget is the focus widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_sensitive -->
Returns the widget’s effective sensitivity, which means
it is sensitive itself and also its parent widget is sensitive

# Returns

`true` if the widget is effectively sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn is_visible -->
Determines whether the widget and all its parents are marked as
visible.

This function does not check if the widget is obscured in any way.

See also `WidgetExt::get_visible` and `WidgetExt::set_visible`

# Returns

`true` if the widget and all its parents are visible
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn keynav_failed -->
This function should be called whenever keyboard navigation within
a single widget hits a boundary. The function emits the
`Widget::keynav-failed` signal on the widget and its return
value should be interpreted in a way similar to the return value of
`WidgetExt::child_focus`:

When `true` is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboard
navigation is OK and/or there is nowhere we can/should move the
focus to.

When `false` is returned, the caller should continue with keyboard
navigation outside the widget, e.g. by calling
`WidgetExt::child_focus` on the widget’s toplevel.

The default ::keynav-failed handler returns `false` for
`DirectionType::TabForward` and `DirectionType::TabBackward`. For the other
values of `DirectionType` it returns `true`.

Whenever the default handler returns `true`, it also calls
`WidgetExt::error_bell` to notify the user of the failed keyboard
navigation.

A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed
(either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row of
`Entry` widgets where the user should be able to navigate the
entire row with the cursor keys, as e.g. known from user interfaces
that require entering license keys.
## `direction`
direction of focus movement

# Returns

`true` if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, `false`
 if the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboard
 navigation attempt in its parent container(s).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn list_mnemonic_labels -->
Returns a newly allocated list of the widgets, normally labels, for
which this widget is the target of a mnemonic (see for example,
`Label::set_mnemonic_widget`).

The widgets in the list are not individually referenced. If you
want to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you
must call `g_list_foreach (result,
(GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and then unref all the
widgets afterwards.

# Returns

the list of
 mnemonic labels; free this list
 with `glib::List::free` when you are done with it.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn map -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be mapped if it isn’t already.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn measure -->
Measures `self` in the orientation `orientation` and for the given `for_size`.
As an example, if `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal` and `for_size` is 300,
this functions will compute the minimum and natural width of `self` if
it is allocated at a height of 300 pixels.

See [`Widget`’s geometry management section][geometry-management] for
a more details on implementing `WidgetClass.measure`().
## `orientation`
the orientation to measure
## `for_size`
Size for the opposite of `orientation`, i.e.
 if `orientation` is `Orientation::Horizontal`, this is
 the height the widget should be measured with. The `Orientation::Vertical`
 case is analogous. This way, both height-for-width and width-for-height
 requests can be implemented. If no size is known, -1 can be passed.
## `minimum`
location to store the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural`
location to store the natural size, or `None`
## `minimum_baseline`
location to store the baseline
 position for the minimum size, or `None`
## `natural_baseline`
location to store the baseline
 position for the natural size, or `None`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn mnemonic_activate -->
Emits the `Widget::mnemonic-activate` signal.
## `group_cycling`
`true` if there are other widgets with the same mnemonic

# Returns

`true` if the signal has been handled
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn observe_children -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the children of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping to track
children and emit signals on the returned listmodel. It may slow down
operations a lot.

Applications should try hard to avoid calling this function because of
the slowdowns.

# Returns

a `gio::ListModel`
 tracking `self`'s children
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn observe_controllers -->
Returns a `gio::ListModel` to track the ``GtkEventControllers`` of `self`.

Calling this function will enable extra internal bookkeeping to track
controllers and emit signals on the returned listmodel. It may slow down
operations a lot.

Applications should try hard to avoid calling this function because of
the slowdowns.

# Returns

a
 `gio::ListModel` tracking `self`'s controllers
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn pick -->
Finds the descendant of `self` (including `self` itself) closest
to the screen at the point (`x`, `y`). The point must be given in
widget coordinates, so (0, 0) is assumed to be the top left of
`self`'s content area.

Usually widgets will return `None` if the given coordinate is not
contained in `self` checked via `WidgetExt::contains`. Otherwise
they will recursively try to find a child that does not return `None`.
Widgets are however free to customize their picking algorithm.

This function is used on the toplevel to determine the widget below
the mouse cursor for purposes of hover highlighting and delivering events.
## `x`
X coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `y`
Y coordinate to test, relative to `self`'s origin
## `flags`
Flags to influence what is picked

# Returns

The widget descendant at the given
 coordinate or `None` if none.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_allocate -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.

Flags the widget for a rerun of the `WidgetClass`::size_allocate
function. Use this function instead of `WidgetExt::queue_resize`
when the `self`'s size request didn't change but it wants to
reposition its contents.

An example user of this function is `WidgetExt::set_halign`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_draw -->
Schedules this widget to be redrawn in paint phase of the
current or the next frame. This means `self`'s `WidgetClass`.`snapshot`
implementation will be called.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn queue_resize -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
Flags a widget to have its size renegotiated; should
be called when a widget for some reason has a new size request.
For example, when you change the text in a `Label`, `Label`
queues a resize to ensure there’s enough space for the new text.

Note that you cannot call `WidgetExt::queue_resize` on a widget
from inside its implementation of the `WidgetClass`::size_allocate
virtual method. Calls to `WidgetExt::queue_resize` from inside
`WidgetClass`::size_allocate will be silently ignored.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn realize -->
Creates the GDK (windowing system) resources associated with a
widget. Normally realization happens implicitly; if you show
a widget and all its parent containers, then the widget will be
realized and mapped automatically.

Realizing a widget requires all
the widget’s parent widgets to be realized; calling
`WidgetExt::realize` realizes the widget’s parents in addition to
`self` itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel window
when you realize it, bad things will happen.

This function is primarily used in widget implementations, and
isn’t very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you might
need it, a better approach is to connect to a signal that will be
called after the widget is realized automatically, such as
`Widget::realize`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_controller -->
Removes `controller` from `self`, so that it doesn't process
events anymore. It should not be used again.

Widgets will remove all event controllers automatically when they
are destroyed, there is normally no need to call this function.
## `controller`
a `EventController`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_css_class -->
Removes `css_class` from `self`. After this, the style of `self`
will stop matching for `css_class`.
## `css_class`
The style class to remove from `self`, without
 the leading '.' used for notation of style classes
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn remove_mnemonic_label -->
Removes a widget from the list of mnemonic labels for
this widget. (See `WidgetExt::list_mnemonic_labels`). The widget
must have previously been added to the list with
`WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
## `label`
a `Widget` that was previously set as a mnemonic label for
 `self` with `WidgetExt::add_mnemonic_label`.
<!-- trait WidgetExtManual::fn remove_tick_callback -->
Removes a tick callback previously registered with
`Widget::add_tick_callback`.
## `id`
an id returned by `Widget::add_tick_callback`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_focus -->
Specifies whether the input focus can enter the widget
or any of its children.

Applications should set `can_focus` to `false` to mark a
widget as for pointer/touch use only.

Note that having `can_focus` be `true` is only one of the
necessary conditions for being focusable. A widget must
also be sensitive and focusable and not have an ancestor
that is marked as not can-focus in order to receive input
focus.

See `WidgetExt::grab_focus` for actually setting the input
focus on a widget.
## `can_focus`
whether or not the input focus can enter
 the widget or any of its children
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_can_target -->
Sets whether `self` can be the target of pointer events.
## `can_target`
whether this widget should be able to receive pointer events
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_child_visible -->
Sets whether `self` should be mapped along with its when its parent
is mapped and `self` has been shown with `WidgetExt::show`.

The child visibility can be set for widget before it is added to
a container with `WidgetExt::set_parent`, to avoid mapping
children unnecessary before immediately unmapping them. However
it will be reset to its default state of `true` when the widget
is removed from a container.

Note that changing the child visibility of a widget does not
queue a resize on the widget. Most of the time, the size of
a widget is computed from all visible children, whether or
not they are mapped. If this is not the case, the container
can queue a resize itself.

This function is only useful for container implementations and
never should be called by an application.
## `child_visible`
if `true`, `self` should be mapped along with its parent.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_css_classes -->
Will clear all css classes applied to `self`
and replace them with `classes`.
## `classes`
`None`-terminated list
 of css classes to apply to `self`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_cursor -->
Sets the cursor to be shown when pointer devices point towards `self`.

If the `cursor` is NULL, `self` will use the cursor inherited from the
parent widget.
## `cursor`
the new cursor or `None` to use the default
 cursor
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_cursor_from_name -->
Sets a named cursor to be shown when pointer devices point towards `self`.

This is a utility function that creates a cursor via
`gdk::Cursor::new_from_name` and then sets it on `self` with
`WidgetExt::set_cursor`. See those 2 functions for details.

On top of that, this function allows `name` to be `None`, which will
do the same as calling `WidgetExt::set_cursor` with a `None` cursor.
## `name`
The name of the cursor or `None` to use the default
 cursor
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_direction -->
Sets the reading direction on a particular widget. This direction
controls the primary direction for widgets containing text,
and also the direction in which the children of a container are
packed. The ability to set the direction is present in order
so that correct localization into languages with right-to-left
reading directions can be done. Generally, applications will
let the default reading direction present, except for containers
where the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitly
visual rather than logical (such as buttons for text justification).

If the direction is set to `TextDirection::None`, then the value
set by `Widget::set_default_direction` will be used.
## `dir`
the new direction
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_focus_child -->
Set `child` as the current focus child of `self`. The previous
focus child will be unset.

This function is only suitable for widget implementations.
If you want a certain widget to get the input focus, call
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` on it.
## `child`
a direct child widget of `self` or `None`
 to unset the focus child of `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_focus_on_click -->
Sets whether the widget should grab focus when it is clicked with the mouse.
Making mouse clicks not grab focus is useful in places like toolbars where
you don’t want the keyboard focus removed from the main area of the
application.
## `focus_on_click`
whether the widget should grab focus when clicked with the mouse
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_focusable -->
Specifies whether `self` can own the input focus.

Widget implementations should set `focusable` to `true` in
their `init` function if they want to receive keyboard input.

Note that having `focusable` be `true` is only one of the
necessary conditions for being focusable. A widget must
also be sensitive and can-focus and not have an ancestor
that is marked as not can-focus in order to receive input
focus.

See `WidgetExt::grab_focus` for actually setting the input
focus on a widget.
## `focusable`
whether or not `self` can own the input focus
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_font_map -->
Sets the font map to use for Pango rendering. The font map is the
object that is used to look up fonts. Setting a custom font map
can be useful in special situations, e.g. when you need to add
application-specific fonts to the set of available fonts.

When not set, the widget will inherit the font map from its parent.
## `font_map`
a `pango::FontMap`, or `None` to unset any previously
 set font map
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_font_options -->
Sets the `cairo::FontOptions` used for Pango rendering in this widget.
When not set, the default font options for the `gdk::Display` will be used.
## `options`
a `cairo::FontOptions`, or `None` to unset any
 previously set default font options.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_halign -->
Sets the horizontal alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:halign` property.
## `align`
the horizontal alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_has_tooltip -->
Sets the has-tooltip property on `self` to `has_tooltip`. See
`Widget:has-tooltip` for more information.
## `has_tooltip`
whether or not `self` has a tooltip.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontal
space. When a user resizes a `Window`, widgets with expand=TRUE
generally receive the extra space. For example, a list or
scrollable area or document in your window would often be set to
expand.

Call this function to set the expand flag if you would like your
widget to become larger horizontally when the window has extra
room.

By default, widgets automatically expand if any of their children
want to expand. (To see if a widget will automatically expand given
its current children and state, call `WidgetExt::compute_expand`. A
container can decide how the expandability of children affects the
expansion of the container by overriding the compute_expand virtual
method on `Widget`.).

Setting hexpand explicitly with this function will override the
automatic expand behavior.

This function forces the widget to expand or not to expand,
regardless of children. The override occurs because
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` sets the hexpand-set property (see
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set`) which causes the widget’s hexpand
value to be used, rather than looking at children and widget state.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_hexpand_set -->
Sets whether the hexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_hexpand`) will
be used.

The hexpand-set property will be set automatically when you call
`WidgetExt::set_hexpand` to set hexpand, so the most likely
reason to use this function would be to unset an explicit expand
flag.

If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed
expand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is not
set, then the expand value depends on whether any
children of the widget would like to expand.

There are few reasons to use this function, but it’s here
for completeness and consistency.
## `set`
value for hexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_layout_manager -->
Sets the layout manager delegate instance that provides an implementation
for measuring and allocating the children of `self`.
## `layout_manager`
a `LayoutManager`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_bottom -->
Sets the bottom margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-bottom` property.
## `margin`
the bottom margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_end -->
Sets the end margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-end` property.
## `margin`
the end margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_start -->
Sets the start margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-start` property.
## `margin`
the start margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_margin_top -->
Sets the top margin of `self`.
See the `Widget:margin-top` property.
## `margin`
the top margin
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_widget_name -->
Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from a
CSS file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular name
in the CSS file. See the documentation for the CSS syntax (on the
same page as the docs for `StyleContext`).

Note that the CSS syntax has certain special characters to delimit
and represent elements in a selector (period, #, >, *...), so using
these will make your widget impossible to match by name. Any combination
of alphanumeric symbols, dashes and underscores will suffice.
## `name`
name for the widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_opacity -->
Request the `self` to be rendered partially transparent, with
opacity 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque. (Opacity
values are clamped to the [0,1] range).

Opacity works on both toplevel widgets and child widgets, although
there are some limitations: For toplevel widgets, applying opacity
depends on the capabilities of the windowing system. On X11, this
has any effect only on X displays with a compositing manager,
see `gdk::Display::is_composited`. On Windows and Wayland it should
always work, although setting a window’s opacity after the window
has been shown may cause some flicker.

Note that the opacity is inherited through inclusion — if you set
a toplevel to be partially translucent, all of its content will
appear translucent, since it is ultimatively rendered on that
toplevel. The opacity value itself is not inherited by child
widgets (since that would make widgets deeper in the hierarchy
progressively more translucent). As a consequence, ``GtkPopovers``
and other `Native` widgets with their own surface will use their
own opacity value, and thus by default appear non-translucent,
even if they are attached to a toplevel that is translucent.
## `opacity`
desired opacity, between 0 and 1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_overflow -->
Sets how `self` treats content that is drawn outside the widget's content area.
See the definition of `Overflow` for details.

This setting is provided for widget implementations and should not be used by
application code.

The default value is `Overflow::Visible`.
## `overflow`
desired overflow
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_parent -->
This function is useful only when implementing subclasses of
`Widget`.

Sets `parent` as the parent widget of `self`, and takes care of
some details such as updating the state and style of the child
to reflect its new location and resizing the parent. The opposite
function is `WidgetExt::unparent`.
## `parent`
parent widget
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_receives_default -->
Specifies whether `self` will be treated as the default
widget within its toplevel when it has the focus, even if
another widget is the default.
## `receives_default`
whether or not `self` can be a default widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_sensitive -->
Sets the sensitivity of a widget. A widget is sensitive if the user
can interact with it. Insensitive widgets are “grayed out” and the
user can’t interact with them. Insensitive widgets are known as
“inactive”, “disabled”, or “ghosted” in some other toolkits.
## `sensitive`
`true` to make the widget sensitive
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_size_request -->
Sets the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget’s size
request will be at least `width` by `height`. You can use this
function to force a widget to be larger than it normally would be.

In most cases, `GtkWindowExt::set_default_size` is a better choice for
toplevel windows than this function; setting the default size will
still allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size request
will force them to leave the window at least as large as the size
request. When dealing with window sizes,
`gtk_window_set_geometry_hints` can be a useful function as well.

Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes,
translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action
can all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it's
basically impossible to hardcode a size that will always be
correct.

The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget can
accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.
However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than
its requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more
space than it requested.

If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), then
the “natural” size request of the widget will be used instead.

The size request set here does not include any margin from the
`Widget` properties margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, and
margin-bottom, but it does include pretty much all other padding
or border properties set by any subclass of `Widget`.
## `width`
width `self` should request, or -1 to unset
## `height`
height `self` should request, or -1 to unset
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns on flag
values in the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).

This function accepts the values `StateFlags::DirLtr` and
`StateFlags::DirRtl` but ignores them. If you want to set
the widget's direction, use `WidgetExt::set_direction`.
## `flags`
State flags to turn on
## `clear`
Whether to clear state before turning on `flags`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_markup -->
Sets `markup` as the contents of the tooltip, which is marked up with
the [Pango text markup language][PangoMarkupFormat].

This function will take care of setting the `Widget:has-tooltip` as
a side effect, and of the default handler for the `Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-markup` property and
`Tooltip::set_markup`.
## `markup`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_tooltip_text -->
Sets `text` as the contents of the tooltip.

If `text` contains any markup, it will be escaped.

This function will take care of setting `Widget:has-tooltip`
as a side effect, and of the default handler for the
`Widget::query-tooltip` signal.

See also the `Widget:tooltip-text` property and
`Tooltip::set_text`.
## `text`
the contents of the tooltip for `self`
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_valign -->
Sets the vertical alignment of `self`.
See the `Widget:valign` property.
## `align`
the vertical alignment
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand -->
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra vertical
space.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand` for more detail.
## `expand`
whether to expand
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_vexpand_set -->
Sets whether the vexpand flag (see `WidgetExt::get_vexpand`) will
be used.

See `WidgetExt::set_hexpand_set` for more detail.
## `set`
value for vexpand-set property
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn set_visible -->
Sets the visibility state of `self`. Note that setting this to
`true` doesn’t mean the widget is actually viewable, see
`WidgetExt::get_visible`.

This function simply calls `WidgetExt::show` or `WidgetExt::hide`
but is nicer to use when the visibility of the widget depends on
some condition.
## `visible`
whether the widget should be shown or not
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn should_layout -->
Returns whether `self` should contribute to
the measuring and allocation of its parent.
This is `false` for invisible children, but also
for children that have their own surface.

# Returns

`true` if child should be included in
 measuring and allocating
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn show -->
Flags a widget to be displayed. Any widget that isn’t shown will
not appear on the screen.

Remember that you have to show the containers containing a widget,
in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear onscreen.

When a toplevel container is shown, it is immediately realized and
mapped; other shown widgets are realized and mapped when their
toplevel container is realized and mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn size_allocate -->
This is a simple form of `WidgetExt::allocate` that takes the new position
of `self` as part of `allocation`.
## `allocation`
position and size to be allocated to `self`
## `baseline`
The baseline of the child, or -1
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn snapshot_child -->
When a widget receives a call to the snapshot function, it must send
synthetic `WidgetClass.snapshot`() calls to all children. This function
provides a convenient way of doing this. A widget, when it receives
a call to its `WidgetClass.snapshot`() function, calls
`WidgetExt::snapshot_child` once for each child, passing in
the `snapshot` the widget received.

`WidgetExt::snapshot_child` takes care of translating the origin of
`snapshot`, and deciding whether the child needs to be snapshot.

This function does nothing for children that implement `Native`.
## `child`
a child of `self`
## `snapshot`
`Snapshot` as passed to the widget. In particular, no
 calls to `Snapshot::translate` or other transform calls should
 have been made.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn translate_coordinates -->
Translate coordinates relative to `self`’s allocation to coordinates
relative to `dest_widget`’s allocations. In order to perform this
operation, both widget must share a common toplevel.
## `dest_widget`
a `Widget`
## `src_x`
X position relative to `self`
## `src_y`
Y position relative to `self`
## `dest_x`
location to store X position relative to `dest_widget`
## `dest_y`
location to store Y position relative to `dest_widget`

# Returns

`false` if `self` and `dest_widget` have no common
 ancestor. In this case, 0 is stored in
 *`dest_x` and *`dest_y`. Otherwise `true`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn trigger_tooltip_query -->
Triggers a tooltip query on the display where the toplevel
of `self` is located.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unmap -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causes
a widget to be unmapped if it’s currently mapped.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unparent -->
This function is only for use in widget implementations.
It should be called by parent widgets to dissociate `self`
from the parent, typically in dispose.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unrealize -->
This function is only useful in widget implementations.
Causes a widget to be unrealized (frees all GDK resources
associated with the widget).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn unset_state_flags -->
This function is for use in widget implementations. Turns off flag
values for the current widget state (insensitive, prelighted, etc.).
See `WidgetExt::set_state_flags`.
## `flags`
State flags to turn off
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_destroy -->
Signals that all holders of a reference to the widget should release
the reference that they hold. May result in finalization of the widget
if all references are released.

This signal is not suitable for saving widget state.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_direction_changed -->
The ::direction-changed signal is emitted when the text direction
of a widget changes.
## `previous_direction`

<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_hide -->
The ::hide signal is emitted when `widget` is hidden, for example with
`WidgetExt::hide`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_keynav_failed -->
Gets emitted if keyboard navigation fails.
See `WidgetExt::keynav_failed` for details.
## `direction`
the direction of movement

# Returns

`true` if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, `false`
 if the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboard
 navigation attempt in its parent widget(s).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_map -->
The ::map signal is emitted when `widget` is going to be mapped, that is
when the widget is visible (which is controlled with
`WidgetExt::set_visible`) and all its parents up to the toplevel widget
are also visible.

The ::map signal can be used to determine whether a widget will be drawn,
for instance it can resume an animation that was stopped during the
emission of `Widget::unmap`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_mnemonic_activate -->
The default handler for this signal activates `widget` if `group_cycling`
is `false`, or just makes `widget` grab focus if `group_cycling` is `true`.
## `group_cycling`
`true` if there are other widgets with the same mnemonic

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
`false` to propagate the event further.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_move_focus -->
Emitted when the focus is moved.
## `direction`
the direction of the focus move
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_query_tooltip -->
Emitted when `Widget:has-tooltip` is `true` and the hover timeout
has expired with the cursor hovering "above" `widget`; or emitted when `widget` got
focus in keyboard mode.

Using the given coordinates, the signal handler should determine
whether a tooltip should be shown for `widget`. If this is the case
`true` should be returned, `false` otherwise. Note that if
`keyboard_mode` is `true`, the values of `x` and `y` are undefined and
should not be used.

The signal handler is free to manipulate `tooltip` with the therefore
destined function calls.
## `x`
the x coordinate of the cursor position where the request has
 been emitted, relative to `widget`'s left side
## `y`
the y coordinate of the cursor position where the request has
 been emitted, relative to `widget`'s top
## `keyboard_mode`
`true` if the tooltip was triggered using the keyboard
## `tooltip`
a `Tooltip`

# Returns

`true` if `tooltip` should be shown right now, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_realize -->
The ::realize signal is emitted when `widget` is associated with a
`gdk::Surface`, which means that `WidgetExt::realize` has been called or the
widget has been mapped (that is, it is going to be drawn).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_show -->
The ::show signal is emitted when `widget` is shown, for example with
`WidgetExt::show`.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_state_flags_changed -->
The ::state-flags-changed signal is emitted when the widget state
changes, see `WidgetExt::get_state_flags`.
## `flags`
The previous state flags.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_unmap -->
The ::unmap signal is emitted when `widget` is going to be unmapped, which
means that either it or any of its parents up to the toplevel widget have
been set as hidden.

As ::unmap indicates that a widget will not be shown any longer, it can be
used to, for example, stop an animation on the widget.
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn connect_unrealize -->
The ::unrealize signal is emitted when the `gdk::Surface` associated with
`widget` is destroyed, which means that `WidgetExt::unrealize` has been
called or the widget has been unmapped (that is, it is going to be
hidden).
<!-- trait WidgetExt::fn get_property_can_focus -->

<!-- struct WidgetPaintable -->
`WidgetPaintable` is an implementation of the `gdk::Paintable` interface
that allows displaying the contents of a `Widget`.

`WidgetPaintable` will also take care of the widget not being in a
state where it can be drawn (like when it isn't shown) and just draw
nothing or where it does not have a size (like when it is hidden) and
report no size in that case.

Of course, `WidgetPaintable` allows you to monitor widgets for size
changes by emitting the `gdk::Paintable::invalidate-size` signal whenever
the size of the widget changes as well as for visual changes by
emitting the `gdk::Paintable::invalidate-contents` signal whenever the
widget changes.

You can of course use a `WidgetPaintable` everywhere a
`gdk::Paintable` is allowed, including using it on a `Picture` (or one
of its parents) that it was set on itself via `Picture::set_paintable`.
The paintable will take care of recursion when this happens. If you do
this however, ensure the `Picture:can-shrink` property is set to
`true` or you might end up with an infinitely growing widget.

# Implements

<!-- impl WidgetPaintable::fn new -->
Creates a new widget paintable observing the given widget.
## `widget`
a `Widget` or `None`

# Returns

a new `WidgetPaintable`
<!-- impl WidgetPaintable::fn get_widget -->
Returns the widget that is observed or `None`
if none.

# Returns

<!-- impl WidgetPaintable::fn set_property_widget -->
The observed widget or `None` if none.
<!-- struct Window -->
A `Window` is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
(resize it, move it, close it,...).

# `Window` as `Buildable`

The `Window` implementation of the `Buildable` interface supports
setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
attribute of a `<child>` element.

# CSS nodes


```plain
window.background
├── <child>
╰── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
```

`Window` has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background.

Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
decorations). `Window` also represents window states with the following
style classes on the main node: .tiled, .maximized, .fullscreen. Specialized
types of window often add their own discriminating style classes, such as
.popup or .tooltip.

Generally, some CSS properties don't make sense on the toplevel window node,
such as margins or padding. When client-side decorations without invisible
borders are in use (i.e. the .solid-csd style class is added to the
main window node), the CSS border of the toplevel window is used for
resize drags. In the .csd case, the shadow area outside of the window
can be used to resize it.

`Window` adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
widget that is added as a titlebar child.

# Accessibility

`Window` uses the `AccessibleRole::Window` role.

<!-- trait GtkWindowExt -->
Trait containing all `Window` methods.

# Implementors

<!-- impl Window::fn new -->
Creates a new `Window`, which is a toplevel window that can
contain other widgets.

To get an undecorated window (no window borders), use
`GtkWindowExt::set_decorated`.

All top-level windows created by `Window::new` are stored in
an internal top-level window list. This list can be obtained from
`Window::list_toplevels`. Due to Gtk+ keeping a reference to
the window internally, `Window::new` does not return a reference
to the caller.

To delete a `Window`, call `GtkWindowExt::destroy`.

# Returns

a new `Window`.
<!-- impl Window::fn get_default_icon_name -->
Returns the fallback icon name for windows that has been set
with `Window::set_default_icon_name`, or `None` if that function
has not been called.

The returned string is owned by GTK and should not be modified.
It is only valid until the next call to `Window::set_default_icon_name`.

# Returns

the fallback icon name for windows
<!-- impl Window::fn get_toplevels -->
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows.

If you want to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets or add new ones, be aware that
the list of toplevels will change and emit the "items-changed" signal.

# Returns

the list
 of toplevel widgets
<!-- impl Window::fn list_toplevels -->
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows. The widgets
in the list are not individually referenced. If you want
to iterate through the list and perform actions involving
callbacks that might destroy the widgets, you must call
`g_list_foreach (result, (GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL)` first, and
then unref all the widgets afterwards.

# Returns

list of toplevel widgets
<!-- impl Window::fn set_auto_startup_notification -->
By default, after showing the first `Window`, GTK calls
`gdk::Display::notify_startup_complete`. Call this function to
disable the automatic startup notification. You might do this
if your first window is a splash screen, and you want to delay
notification until after your real main window has been shown,
for example.

In that example, you would disable startup notification
temporarily, show your splash screen, then re-enable it so that
showing the main window would automatically result in notification.
## `setting`
`true` to automatically do startup notification
<!-- impl Window::fn set_default_icon_name -->
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that
haven't had `GtkWindowExt::set_icon_name` called on them.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- impl Window::fn set_interactive_debugging -->
Opens or closes the [interactive debugger][interactive-debugging],
which offers access to the widget hierarchy of the application
and to useful debugging tools.
## `enable`
`true` to enable interactive debugging
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn close -->
Requests that the window is closed, similar to what happens
when a window manager close button is clicked.

This function can be used with close buttons in custom
titlebars.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn destroy -->
Drop the internal reference GTK holds on toplevel windows.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn fullscreen -->
Asks to place `self` in the fullscreen state.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely full screen afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could
unfullscreen it again, and not all window managers honor requests to fullscreen
windows.

You can track the result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state` property,
or by listening to notifications of the `Window:fullscreened` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn fullscreen_on_monitor -->
Asks to place `self` in the fullscreen state on the given `monitor`.

Note that you shouldn't assume the window is definitely full screen
afterward, or that the windowing system allows fullscreen windows on
any given monitor.

You can track the result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state`
property, or by listening to notifications of the `Window:fullscreened`
property.
## `monitor`
which monitor to go fullscreen on
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_application -->
Gets the `Application` associated with the window (if any).

# Returns

a `Application`, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_child -->
Gets the child widget of `self`.

# Returns

the child widget of `self`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_decorated -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have decorations
such as a title bar via `GtkWindowExt::set_decorated`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have decorations
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_default_size -->
Gets the default size of the window. A value of 0 for the width or
height indicates that a default size has not been explicitly set
for that dimension, so the “natural” size of the window will be
used.
## `width`
location to store the default width, or `None`
## `height`
location to store the default height, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_default_widget -->
Returns the default widget for `self`.

See `GtkWindowExt::set_default_widget` for more details.

# Returns

the default widget, or `None`
if there is none.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_deletable -->
Returns whether the window has been set to have a close button
via `GtkWindowExt::set_deletable`.

# Returns

`true` if the window has been set to have a close button
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_destroy_with_parent -->
Returns whether the window will be destroyed with its transient parent. See
gtk_window_set_destroy_with_parent ().

# Returns

`true` if the window will be destroyed with its transient parent.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_focus -->
Retrieves the current focused widget within the window.
Note that this is the widget that would have the focus
if the toplevel window focused; if the toplevel window
is not focused then `gtk_widget_has_focus (widget)` will
not be `true` for the widget.

# Returns

the currently focused widget,
or `None` if there is none.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_focus_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:focus-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if “focus rectangles” are supposed to be visible
 in this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_group -->
Returns the group for `self` or the default group, if
`self` is `None` or if `self` does not have an explicit
window group.

# Returns

the `WindowGroup` for a window or the default group
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_hide_on_close -->
Returns whether the window will be hidden when the close button is clicked.

# Returns

`true` if the window will be hidden
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_icon_name -->
Returns the name of the themed icon for the window,
see `GtkWindowExt::set_icon_name`.

# Returns

the icon name or `None` if the window has
no themed icon
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_mnemonics_visible -->
Gets the value of the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.

# Returns

`true` if mnemonics are supposed to be visible
in this window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_modal -->
Returns whether the window is modal. See `GtkWindowExt::set_modal`.

# Returns

`true` if the window is set to be modal and
 establishes a grab when shown
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_resizable -->
Gets the value set by `GtkWindowExt::set_resizable`.

# Returns

`true` if the user can resize the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_title -->
Retrieves the title of the window. See `GtkWindowExt::set_title`.

# Returns

the title of the window, or `None` if none has
been set explicitly. The returned string is owned by the widget
and must not be modified or freed.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_titlebar -->
Returns the custom titlebar that has been set with
`GtkWindowExt::set_titlebar`.

# Returns

the custom titlebar, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_transient_for -->
Fetches the transient parent for this window. See
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for`.

# Returns

the transient parent for this
window, or `None` if no transient parent has been set.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn has_group -->
Returns whether `self` has an explicit window group.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has an explicit window group.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn is_active -->
Returns whether the window is part of the current active toplevel.
(That is, the toplevel window receiving keystrokes.)
The return value is `true` if the window is active toplevel itself.
You might use this function if you wanted to draw a widget
differently in an active window from a widget in an inactive window.

# Returns

`true` if the window part of the current active window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn is_fullscreen -->
Retrieves the current fullscreen state of `self`.

Note that since fullscreening is ultimately handled by the window
manager and happens asynchronously to an application request, you
shouldn’t assume the return value of this function changing
immediately (or at all), as an effect of calling
`GtkWindowExt::fullscreen` or `GtkWindowExt::unfullscreen`.

If the window isn't yet mapped, the value returned will whether the
initial requested state is fullscreen.

# Returns

whether the window has a fullscreen state.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn is_maximized -->
Retrieves the current maximized state of `self`.

Note that since maximization is ultimately handled by the window
manager and happens asynchronously to an application request, you
shouldn’t assume the return value of this function changing
immediately (or at all), as an effect of calling
`GtkWindowExt::maximize` or `GtkWindowExt::unmaximize`.

If the window isn't yet mapped, the value returned will whether the
initial requested state is maximized.

# Returns

whether the window has a maximized state.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn maximize -->
Asks to maximize `self`, so that it fills the screen.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely maximized afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch])
could unmaximize it again, and not all window managers support maximization.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window, in which case
the window will be maximized when it appears onscreen initially.

You can track the result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state`
property, or by listening to notifications on the `Window:maximized`
property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn minimize -->
Asks to minimize the specified `self`.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely minimized
afterward, because the windowing system might not support this
functionality; other entities (e.g. the user or the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch])
could unminimize it again, or there may not be a window manager in
which case minimization isn’t possible, etc.

It’s permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be minimized before it ever appears
onscreen.

You can track result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state`
property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn present -->
Presents a window to the user. This function should not be used
as when it is called, it is too late to gather a valid timestamp
to allow focus stealing prevention to work correctly.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn present_with_time -->
Presents a window to the user. This may mean raising the window
in the stacking order, unminimizing it, moving it to the current
desktop, and/or giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependent
on the user’s platform, window manager, and preferences.

If `self` is hidden, this function calls `WidgetExt::show`
as well.

This function should be used when the user tries to open a window
that’s already open. Say for example the preferences dialog is
currently open, and the user chooses Preferences from the menu
a second time; use `GtkWindowExt::present` to move the already-open dialog
where the user can see it.

Presents a window to the user in response to a user interaction. The
timestamp should be gathered when the window was requested to be shown
(when clicking a link for example), rather than once the window is
ready to be shown.
## `timestamp`
the timestamp of the user interaction (typically a
 button or key press event) which triggered this call
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_application -->
Sets or unsets the `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it has any windows
associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold` for a way to keep it alive
without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window will remain
until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly remove it by setting
the `application` to `None`.

This is equivalent to calling `GtkApplicationExt::remove_window` and/or
`GtkApplicationExt::add_window` on the old/new applications as relevant.
## `application`
a `Application`, or `None` to unset
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_child -->
Sets the child widget of `self`.
## `child`
the child widget
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_decorated -->
By default, windows are decorated with a title bar, resize
controls, etc. Some [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
allow GTK to disable these decorations, creating a
borderless window. If you set the decorated property to `false`
using this function, GTK will do its best to convince the window
manager not to decorate the window. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_default_size -->
Sets the default size of a window. If the window’s “natural” size
(its size request) is larger than the default, the default will be
ignored.

Unlike `WidgetExt::set_size_request`, which sets a size request for
a widget and thus would keep users from shrinking the window, this
function only sets the initial size, just as if the user had
resized the window themselves. Users can still shrink the window
again as they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to
use the “natural” default size (the size request of the window).

The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size
it had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.

Windows can’t actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
passing 0 for `width` and `height` is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.

If you use this function to reestablish a previously saved window size,
note that the appropriate size to save is the one returned by
`GtkWindowExt::get_default_size`. Using the window allocation directly will not
work in all circumstances and can lead to growing or shrinking windows.
## `width`
width in pixels, or -1 to unset the default width
## `height`
height in pixels, or -1 to unset the default height
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_default_widget -->
The default widget is the widget that’s activated when the user
presses Enter in a dialog (for example). This function sets or
unsets the default widget for a `Window`.
## `default_widget`
widget to be the default, or `None`
 to unset the default widget for the toplevel
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_deletable -->
By default, windows have a close button in the window frame. Some
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] allow GTK to
disable this button. If you set the deletable property to `false`
using this function, GTK will do its best to convince the window
manager not to show a close button. Depending on the system, this
function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
already visible, so you should call it before calling `WidgetExt::show`.

On Windows, this function always works, since there’s no window manager
policy involved.
## `setting`
`true` to decorate the window as deletable
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_destroy_with_parent -->
If `setting` is `true`, then destroying the transient parent of `self`
will also destroy `self` itself. This is useful for dialogs that
shouldn’t persist beyond the lifetime of the main window they're
associated with, for example.
## `setting`
whether to destroy `self` with its transient parent
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_display -->
Sets the `gdk::Display` where the `self` is displayed; if
the window is already mapped, it will be unmapped, and
then remapped on the new display.
## `display`
a `gdk::Display`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_focus -->
If `focus` is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets
it as the focus widget for the window. If `focus` is `None`, unsets
the focus widget for this window. To set the focus to a particular
widget in the toplevel, it is usually more convenient to use
`WidgetExt::grab_focus` instead of this function.
## `focus`
widget to be the new focus widget, or `None` to unset
 any focus widget for the toplevel window.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_focus_visible -->
Sets the `Window:focus-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_hide_on_close -->
If `setting` is `true`, then clicking the close button on the window
will not destroy it, but only hide it.
## `setting`
whether to hide the window when it is closed
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_icon_name -->
Sets the icon for the window from a named themed icon.
See the docs for `IconTheme` for more details.
On some platforms, the window icon is not used at all.

Note that this has nothing to do with the WM_ICON_NAME
property which is mentioned in the ICCCM.
## `name`
the name of the themed icon
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_mnemonics_visible -->
Sets the `Window:mnemonics-visible` property.
## `setting`
the new value
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_modal -->
Sets a window modal or non-modal. Modal windows prevent interaction
with other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogs
on top of main application windows, use
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` to make the dialog transient for the
parent; most [window managers][gtk-X11-arch]
will then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
## `modal`
whether the window is modal
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_resizable -->
Sets whether the user can resize a window.

Windows are user resizable by default.
## `resizable`
`true` if the user can resize this window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_startup_id -->
Startup notification identifiers are used by desktop environment to
track application startup, to provide user feedback and other
features. This function changes the corresponding property on the
underlying `gdk::Surface`. Normally, startup identifier is managed
automatically and you should only use this function in special cases
like transferring focus from other processes. You should use this
function before calling `GtkWindowExt::present` or any equivalent
function generating a window map event.

This function is only useful on X11, not with other GTK targets.
## `startup_id`
a string with startup-notification identifier
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_title -->
Sets the title of the `Window`. The title of a window will be
displayed in its title bar; on the X Window System, the title bar
is rendered by the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch],
so exactly how the title appears to users may vary
according to a user’s exact configuration. The title should help a
user distinguish this window from other windows they may have
open. A good title might include the application name and current
document filename, for example.
document filename, for example.

Passing `None` does the same as setting the title to an empty string.
## `title`
title of the window
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_titlebar -->
Sets a custom titlebar for `self`.

A typical widget used here is `HeaderBar`, as it provides various features
expected of a titlebar while allowing the addition of child widgets to it.

If you set a custom titlebar, GTK will do its best to convince
the window manager not to put its own titlebar on the window.
Depending on the system, this function may not work for a window
that is already visible, so you set the titlebar before calling
`WidgetExt::show`.
## `titlebar`
the widget to use as titlebar
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_transient_for -->
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows
[window managers][gtk-X11-arch] to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window. `Dialog::new_with_buttons` and other convenience
functions in GTK will sometimes call
`GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` on your behalf.

Passing `None` for `parent` unsets the current transient window.

On Windows, this function puts the child window on top of the parent,
much as the window manager would have done on X.
## `parent`
parent window, or `None`
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unfullscreen -->
Asks to remove the fullscreen state for `self`, and return to its previous
state.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely not full screen afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could
fullscreen it again, and not all window managers honor requests to unfullscreen
windows; normally the window will end up restored to its normal state. Just don’t
write code that crashes if not.

You can track the result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state` property,
or by listening to notifications of the `Window:fullscreened` property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unmaximize -->
Asks to unmaximize `self`.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely unmaximized afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or [window manager][gtk-X11-arch]) could
maximize it again, and not all window managers honor requests to unmaximize.

You can track the result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state`
property, or by listening to notifications on the `Window:maximized`
property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn unminimize -->
Asks to unminimize the specified `self`.

Note that you shouldn’t assume the window is definitely unminimized
afterward, because the windowing system might not support this
functionality; other entities (e.g. the user or the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch])
could minimize it again, or there may not be a window manager in
which case minimization isn’t possible, etc.

You can track result of this operation via the `gdk::Toplevel:state`
property.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_activate_default -->
The ::activate-default signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user activates the default widget
of `window`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_activate_focus -->
The ::activate-focus signal is a
[keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user activates the currently
focused widget of `window`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_close_request -->
The ::close-request signal is emitted when the user clicks on the close
button of the window.

# Returns

`true` to stop other handlers from being invoked for the signal
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_enable_debugging -->
The ::enable-debugging signal is a [keybinding signal][`SignalAction`]
which gets emitted when the user enables or disables interactive
debugging. When `toggle` is `true`, interactive debugging is toggled
on or off, when it is `false`, the debugger will be pointed at the
widget under the pointer.

The default bindings for this signal are Ctrl-Shift-I
and Ctrl-Shift-D.
## `toggle`
toggle the debugger

# Returns

`true` if the key binding was handled
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn connect_keys_changed -->
The ::keys-changed signal gets emitted when the set of accelerators
or mnemonics that are associated with `window` changes.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_application -->
The `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it
has any windows associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold`
for a way to keep it alive without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it by setting the :application property to `None`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_application -->
The `Application` associated with the window.

The application will be kept alive for at least as long as it
has any windows associated with it (see `gio::ApplicationExt::hold`
for a way to keep it alive without windows).

Normally, the connection between the application and the window
will remain until the window is destroyed, but you can explicitly
remove it by setting the :application property to `None`.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_decorated -->
Whether the window should be decorated by the window manager.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_decorated -->
Whether the window should be decorated by the window manager.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_deletable -->
Whether the window frame should have a close button.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_deletable -->
Whether the window frame should have a close button.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_focus_visible -->
Whether 'focus rectangles' are currently visible in this window.

This property is maintained by GTK based on user input
and should not be set by applications.

Whether 'focus rectangles' are currently visible in this window.

This property is maintained by GTK based on user input
and should not be set by applications.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_fullscreened -->
Whether the window is fullscreen.

Setting this property is the equivalent of calling `GtkWindowExt::fullscreen`
and `GtkWindowExt::unfullscreen`; either operation is asynchronous, which
means you will need to connect to the `gobject::Object::notify` signal in order to
know whether the operation was successful.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_fullscreened -->
Whether the window is fullscreen.

Setting this property is the equivalent of calling `GtkWindowExt::fullscreen`
and `GtkWindowExt::unfullscreen`; either operation is asynchronous, which
means you will need to connect to the `gobject::Object::notify` signal in order to
know whether the operation was successful.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_icon_name -->
The :icon-name property specifies the name of the themed icon to
use as the window icon. See `IconTheme` for more details.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_icon_name -->
The :icon-name property specifies the name of the themed icon to
use as the window icon. See `IconTheme` for more details.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_maximized -->
Whether the window is maximized.

Setting this property is the equivalent of calling `GtkWindowExt::maximize`
and `GtkWindowExt::unmaximize`; either operation is asynchronous, which
means you will need to connect to the `gobject::Object::notify` signal in order to
know whether the operation was successful.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_maximized -->
Whether the window is maximized.

Setting this property is the equivalent of calling `GtkWindowExt::maximize`
and `GtkWindowExt::unmaximize`; either operation is asynchronous, which
means you will need to connect to the `gobject::Object::notify` signal in order to
know whether the operation was successful.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_mnemonics_visible -->
Whether mnemonics are currently visible in this window.

This property is maintained by GTK based on user input,
and should not be set by applications.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_mnemonics_visible -->
Whether mnemonics are currently visible in this window.

This property is maintained by GTK based on user input,
and should not be set by applications.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_startup_id -->
The :startup-id is a write-only property for setting window's
startup notification identifier. See `GtkWindowExt::set_startup_id`
for more details.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn get_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the window. See `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` for
more details about transient windows.
<!-- trait GtkWindowExt::fn set_property_transient_for -->
The transient parent of the window. See `GtkWindowExt::set_transient_for` for
more details about transient windows.
<!-- struct WindowControls -->
`WindowControls` shows window frame controls, such as minimize, maximize
and close buttons, and the window icon.

`WindowControls` only displays start or end side of the controls (see
`WindowControls:side`), so it's intended to be always used in pair with
another `WindowControls` using the opposite side, for example:


```plain
windowcontrols
├── [image.icon]
├── [button.minimize]
├── [button.maximize]
╰── [button.close]
```

A `WindowControls`' CSS node is called windowcontrols. It contains
subnodes corresponding to each title button. Which of the title buttons
exist and where they are placed exactly depends on the desktop environment
and `WindowControls:decoration-layout` value.

When `WindowControls:empty` is `true`, it gets the .empty style class.

# Accessibility

`WindowHandle` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.

<!-- impl WindowControls::fn new -->
Creates a new `WindowControls`.
## `side`
the side

# Returns

a new `WindowControls`.
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_decoration_layout -->
Gets the decoration layout set with
`WindowControls::set_decoration_layout`.

# Returns

the decoration layout or `None` if it is unset
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_empty -->
Gets whether the widget has any window buttons.

# Returns

`true` if the widget has window buttons, otherwise `false`
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_side -->
Gets the side set with `WindowControls::set_side`.

# Returns

the side
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn set_decoration_layout -->
Sets the decoration layout for the title buttons, overriding
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting.

The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.
A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the left
from those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,
maximize, close and icon (the window icon).

For example, “icon:minimize,maximize,close” specifies a icon
on the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.

If `WindowControls:side` value is `PackType::Start`, `self` will
display the part before the colon, otherwise after that.
## `layout`
a decoration layout, or `None` to
 unset the layout
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn set_side -->
Sets the side for `self`, determining which part of decoration layout it uses.

See `WindowControls::set_decoration_layout`
## `side`
a side
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for window buttons. If this property is not set,
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting is used.

See `WindowControls::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn set_property_decoration_layout -->
The decoration layout for window buttons. If this property is not set,
the `Settings:gtk-decoration-layout` setting is used.

See `WindowControls::set_decoration_layout` for information
about the format of this string.
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_property_empty -->
Whether the widget has any window buttons.
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn get_property_side -->
Whether the widget shows start or end side of the decoration layout.

See `WindowControls::set_decoration_layout`.
<!-- impl WindowControls::fn set_property_side -->
Whether the widget shows start or end side of the decoration layout.

See `WindowControls::set_decoration_layout`.
<!-- struct WindowGroup -->
A `WindowGroup` restricts the effect of grabs to windows
in the same group, thereby making window groups almost behave
like separate applications.

A window can be a member in at most one window group at a time.
Windows that have not been explicitly assigned to a group are
implicitly treated like windows of the default window group.

`WindowGroup` objects are referenced by each window in the group,
so once you have added all windows to a `WindowGroup`, you can drop
the initial reference to the window group with `gobject::ObjectExt::unref`. If the
windows in the window group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the window group and drop their references on the window
group; when all window have been removed, the window group will be
freed.

# Implements

[`WindowGroupExt`](trait.WindowGroupExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait WindowGroupExt -->
Trait containing all `WindowGroup` methods.

<!-- struct WindowHandle -->
`WindowHandle` is a titlebar area widget. When added into a window, it can
be dragged to move the window, and handles right click, double click and
middle click as expected of a titlebar.

# CSS nodes

`WindowHandle` has a single CSS node with the name `windowhandle`.

# Accessibility

`WindowHandle` uses the `AccessibleRole::Group` role.
